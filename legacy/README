The file titles.dat is a data file containing the list of 
known titles.  It needs to be present in the directory or 
else running the main proram will try to load it, fail, 
and issue a segmentation fault (see line 448).

At present (14/0710) the program can call a single SnapStream 
file, either by name or from standard input.  Whether to use
a file name or stdin is hard-coded.  The hard-coding occurs
in the routine "getstring" in lines 109-110.  There are two 
versions of example programs copied from the old directory:

	"eg01china.c" is hard-coded to use stdin
	"eg02trade.c" is hard-coded to use the file "Data/2012-10-23.txt"

These are set to be read-only.  Please make copies when fiddling with them.

Line 508 tells the program only to do Boolean searching within programs
whose unique title identifier is nonzero.  If titles.dat contains
all known titles then this should be any program for which there
was not a titling error.  If titles.dat is altered to be a subset
of titles, then this line invokes the list as a mask.
