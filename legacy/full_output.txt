there have been false leads in this investigation and this is a time when we certainly don't want to give these families false hope.

Now that you don't report it directly to the command of the investigation, you've got this game of telephone, you've got 

the surface. Why can't they see anything that we can associate with two black b box boxes? Let's get the submersibles down there to look at debris floor as well. Until we have that cooperated evidence, then we need to be extremely cautious ant where we take this information from CHINA 00:11:19]

in? 
>> I am skeptically optimistic. It is a mess will let's call it what it is. It is a mess because all the mechanisms designed to prevent exactly the speculation and rampant what is, what if, what happens have now gone right out of the windowecause of the way the CHINESE have announced this, through xinhua. All the command and control structures 
-- whether by beijing to malaysia to perth, it doesn't matter. This is being set up in a particular way, specifically to avoid this sort of crucial information or misinformation from being leaked at exactly the wrong moment 

and false hope to families and setting everybody off in the wrong direction. So, what has to happen now? That's what has happened so far. What has to happen now? The australians basically get their hands around this and start pulling all the information together. They find out which the CHINESE exactly what it is they have found, what it is they have discovered and more assets get moved in the general direction. 10:00 at night there of course so it will be somewhat difficult. They will be searching at night which they can do. Until the australians via

We've got our panel here covering this search and this investigation from many different 

out in is a sketchy report at this point. We have to really be cautious and I think as richard said, this really shines a light on, you know, the flaws and how the organization is set up. And I don't blame the malaysians or the australians. I think the CHINESE are sort of doing their own thing under this broader umbrella. 
>> I want to go to ocean search specialist mike williamson. We understand from the australians that they were notified of this report by xinhua. It has not yet been confirmed but they were notified around lunchtime, which would 

out about it, say, six hours ago, lunchtime their time, six or seven hours ago. If this were a false positive, would we not at least know that by now? Because we are just learning about it this morning but they've known about it for six or seven hours. And CHINA still felt compelled to release the information. Have they not been ableo wipe out whether a false positive is indeed the case? 
>> Well, because there are some other possibilities, I would expect that maybe the australians were trying to figure out if they could get confirmation. It would be

That gives us almost 12 hours ago these pictures were 

protocol is these would thene given to malaysia and then also shared with the australians as we learned as the information came out about those pulses that were detected. But here again, is a map of where this pulse signal was detected and now we've got news from xinhua, the CHINESE state news agency, itthat almost objects have been seen in this search area.

going to dispatch the appropriate resources to those locations and look for the debris and look with the autonomous vehicle and the side scan, radar vehicles 
-- sonar vehicles. We're going to search that site and try to find it. They've said really nothing officially. So everything is coming through CHINA media rather than the command post in australia. I realize it's almost 11:00 at night in australia and in beijing, for that matter. But something something out, a press release, something that you're on this, you're working on it. You've deployed appropriate resources. We're hearing nothing in a

to difficult, chain of command, protocol, and tom fuentes, I got a great question that just came in via twitter from claudia. She says, if the black box is found, and maybe this is it, maybe not, who gets it, the malaysian government because it was a malaysian plane, the CHINESE because they found it, the australians because they lead the search. 
>> Victor, it's not finders keepers. The box goes to the malaysian government and it's up to their decision making to give it to to analyze whether they think they have the people who can study it or give 

times because they've dealt with so many plane crashes. It belongs to the malaysians.

believe that indeed this frequency that was picked up was, indeed, the ping. I think we've got the map showing where this was detected near the search areas today but not only the sound or the ping is also the photographs that were taken, we're told, according to xinhua, the CHINESE state news agencies, about the floating objects 12 hours ago.

looked at. But we don't have any official word on that. We do though have official word on these 
-- the possible ping de detected. We know the australian defense force from our source in the defense force, they tell us they got word around lunchtime on saturday that the CHINESE ship had detected something and at that moment and now for the past, you know, 10 to 12 hours or so, they have been trying to establish communication with the CHINESE ship that reported this, the haixun.

But what we do know is that at least militarily they haven't been able to establish a direct connection with this 

to get more information about this. So there's, you know, cautious optimism but also a lot of skepticism as well. 
>> All right. Will ripley, thanks so much. Let's talk more about this. Let's bring in richard quest, avi aviation correspondent for cnn. Richard, let's look at the map where the CHINESE patrol ship discovered this pulse signal and now we understand as well CHINESE air assets may have also spotted debris in that same general vicinity. We understand that australian authorities leading this investigation nearby have not heard or at least have not confirmed with us whathinese news agency material 

also a lot of skepticism as well.

We understand that australian authorities leading this investigation nearby have not heard or at least have not confirmed with us whathinese news agency material is. Where does this investigation go from here? What do you need to 

to hear that the next order of business is? 
[01:04:06]



>> Very simple, weeed to hear from the jacc, the australian joint coordinating center, that they have now received actually a report about this, a credible report, and that they are sending further assets to investigate it. Even the CHINESE television reporter who broke this story with xinhua news agency says that on board the haixun they warned this might not be anything because of other ships in the area. Look at the map. Let's go back to the map, if we can, fred, because I think the first 

we'll check back with you. Right now we're joined on the phone by cnn analyst david in boston, director of special projects at the oceanographic institution. David, you know, it is easy to be skeptical about these reports, especially since we have noteard any confirmation coming from other entitiesbeijing, this CHINESE news agency. What sounds credible about this potential picking up of a pulse in this area to you? 
>> Right, fred. Any lead at this point is worthy of further investigation. And I agree completely with everything richard said about theaphazard nature of this because that's the last thing you 

the water there was an announcement in the french media the plane had been located. We had our own version of a false alarm during the search and it was completely disruptive. So you know, I guess what will happen is that there will be a certain time where the CHINESE will be allowed to verify and then probably some other assets going to move into the area and see if they 
-- if they hear anything. You know, it's not the prime search area but it's not out of question that this could possibly be from the black box. 
>> 

of time because we're talking about the life expectancy of the battery on this pinger, on this flight and voice recorders. And if today may be one of the last days of the life expectancy of that battery it would seem those other ships would have to get to that CHINESES vessel or at least that location in a matter of hours and what we're talking about hundreds of miles, these ships can't move that quickly. What are the other ways or could they? Are you about to correct me? 
>> No, no, that's part of the problem. And maybe submarines 

hundreds of miles, these ships can't move that quickly. What are the other ways or could they? Are you about to correct me? 
>> No, no, that's part of the problem. And maybe submarines can get there. They can move fairly quickly underwater. We don't know what technology is onboard that CHINESE patrol boat. They are very capable, oceanographers. They are moving quickly in lead in terms of the globe, in terms of studying the deep ocean. It wouldn't surprise me if they got very sophisticated equipment. You're right. One of the worst things that could happen is that we never 

enforcement analyst and retired navy captain in seattle. So, art, let me go with you first. You just heard from david gallo who says next step is critical. Are you in agreement with that and, if that's the case, what are the next steps to try and verify what this CHINESE ship says it has deteged? 
>> Certainly. I am in agreement with david. Number one, the signal is not the signal that the pinger on the aircraft would put out would be a signal every second, there abouts. This is a single pulse as i understand it, which is the 

david. Number one, the signal is not the signal that the pinger on the aircraft would put out would be a signal every second, there abouts. This is a single pulse as i understand it, which is the wrong signal. Number two, we have seen pictures of this 
-- of CHINESE crewmen from a small boat putting a hydrophone in the water at the surface. This pinger on the airplane can't reach the surface. It's 4400 meters at that point. Depth of water. So they can't physically hear that signal from the surface. Number three, we don't know what equipment 

crewmen from a small boat putting a hydrophone in the water at the surface. This pinger on the airplane can't reach the surface. It's 4400 meters at that point. Depth of water. So they can't physically hear that signal from the surface. Number three, we don't know what equipment the CHINESE is using. They say 37.5 kilohertz. But that's 
-- it could be a wide band frequency, it could be anywhere between 40 and 70 frequency kilohertz. So there are a lot of questions that have to be answered. I would discount that. 
>> So, art, let's play some sound 

is unusual, sounds like the wrong signal. Here's an example of, I guess, what the correct signal would be, what the sound would be from that pinger. 
>> It's just a click. You got it. 
>> All right. So that's what it should sound like. We don't know if that's what the CHINESE vesse says it has heard. But apparently this CHINESE vessel, art, has the kind of sonar equipment that would be able to detect this kind of pulse. And this was unbenownst to many. Many thought that only this austraan vessel, as well as a british vessel, had this kind

What do you need to hear from them to verify whether the signal we just heard matches the signal that they picked up? 
[01:13:35]



>> They could play that signal on the area. We could listen to it. 
>> How do we know 

as simple as that or do you have a level of skepticism? 
>> I have a huge level of skepticism, fredericka. As far as radio transmit that signal to show, I'll leave that to the other experts. But in terms of the way this has been handled and both by the CHINESE and the australians for that matter, I mean, if they were given this information 12 hours ago, that would have been midday lunchtime in australia. And they certainly could have made some announcement that we've received 
-- don't get all excited and raise false hopes but say here are 

vacuum and everybody, including the families, including us, get excited and maybe for nothing. 
>> So, david, especially since we're talking about time being so critical, this battery life may only have a matter of hours to go, would it be your view that you could kind of empathize with the CHINESE as to why they would feel this urgency to publicize this information without confirmation that its CHINESE nationals have a larger interest in the outcome of this investigation?

[ Male Announcer ] LET QUICKEN LOANS HELP You save your money with a mortgage that's engineered to amaze. Thanks, "g." We're continuing to discuss what a CHINESE ship it's now saying it detected in the southern indian ocean, that perhaps its device was able to pick up a ping, a pulse that may be that of the voice or flight data recorders there in the indian ocean as it pertains to flight 370. My next guest 

continue until the device is recovered for a period of 30 days. Possibly a bit more depending on the condition and age of the battery. And that is what authorities are hopefully listening and hearing in this situation. 
[01:23:39]



>> So it's fascinating about what we're hearing from the CHINESE news agency is that this CHINESE vessel, unbeknownst to anyone else had this equipment on its ship and it just happened to be potentially in the right location which is a few hundred miles from that central april 5th latest search location, northwest of perth. And that it was

And that it was able to detect this beacon which 

on the 30th day, which will be the life expectancy of that battery. That's what's so remarkable here. And that ship is saying that that signal is 37.5 kilohertz per second which is in concert with what you're saying. But what more would you need to hear from this CHINESE vessel or anyone else leading this investigation to help verify whether what they're hearing is, indeed, potentially the pulse from a flight or voice recorder? 
>> Sure. First thing we would want is multiple sources they can pick up this signal. Also, keep in mind, there should be two beacons 

If I can interrupt you there because we're talking about a matter of hours perhaps because of the life expectancy of this battery, it's going to take many hours for another vessel to get into that area. So is there any verification you would be able to get from this CHINESE vessel because it may be on the of this location that it says is confident is a pulse. What would you need from that CHINESE vessel?

This search area is one that officials have been zeroing in on since april 5th but now this CHINESE vessel saying that it is detecting this ping or pulse in an area just a few hundred miles outside of that search area.

just need to point out that that we obviously are hopeful for any clues but we need to be careful as well.

>> Yeah, it would also be extraordinary because we've been talking about drift patterns and if this ping sound would be in close proximity to where CHINESE air assets believe they actually spotted debris, that would be just s remarkable given the amount of time that has elapsed.

What more do you need to hear about the cooperation between these countries and what evidence is 

to confirm these reports, art? 
[01:43:12]



>> Well, for the debris, yes, i would certainly like them to continue to determine what that debris is. That's in the area. That can be very important. As far as the pulse goes, one, we need to know the characteristics of the CHINESE hydrofoam. We need to confirm how far the pinger can actually reach and we didn't know what that signal is actually like. We need to talk to CHINESE a lot more.

>> Right. So 

because there have been so many false hopes already, whether it be sightings of debris by a matter of 70 feet or, you know, something that was a foot long and then much of it has turned out to be trash in the indian ocean and now you have a CHINESE vessel as well as a CHINESE plane, both saying that they are spotting things that are consistent with debris or some evidence of the plane. It's understandable why there's so much caution but at the same time all of these things had to be taken so seriously, everything does,

able to read the flight data recorder may be the key to what may have happened to flight 370. How is the information stored and recovered. And cnn's zayne asher is here. You have the inside workings of the black boxes and we're talking about that particularly today because a CHINESE ship believes it heard the pulse of what could be connected to a black box to flight 370 and perhaps even a CHINESE plane says it may have seen debris. All of that is being investigated, but for now.

>> Black boxes are absolutely crucial because every time a pilot flips 

is anticipation given the pulse signals. 
>> Right. Those pulse signals come from this device that is attached to the flight data or voice recorder and there is a sensor on here so as soon as it hits water, that's when the pulse signal goes off and at least right now, CHINESE authorities believe that they have sonar equipment that may have detected the pulse signal and of course, the australians are saying we're thinking of devoting assets to try and verify, but for now, this is the best that any commercial airline has, but the future might involve a flight

>> It's an incredible investment and nobody wishes it would be put to use, but things happen and the best they can improve technology, of course, that would improve investigations. Zain, thank you so much. We'll have much more on the investigation of mh-370 and right now the CHINESE authorities standing by their story, at least by way of the news agency that they believe they have found a pulse and perhaps even debris in an area that australia are considering assets to investigate and verify.

hope. Nonetheless, thin the last 30 minutes we are hearing from the joint agency coordination center angus houston.

here, there is no confirmation at this stage that the signals and the objects are related to the missing aircraft. We know that australian officials have had this information to some extent for the past ten to 12 hours or so and they've been trying to establish communication with the CHINESE ship that supposedly detected these underwater pings, the hixuean, and that's the center disseminating to australia. A lot of questions than answers and they're moving forward with this information and trying to find out what the next step would be.

I understand the urgency of the pinger which is deteriorating in strength, but just because the CHINESE have said we think we found a pinger, australia, as being the responsible agency for the whole search and recovery has to verifynd confirm before it decides to shift vast amounts of assets in the search. 
>> Okay. All right. Well let's continue this dialogue and broaden it out some 

magazine, a 777 captain and a cnn aviation analyst.Thanks to all of you. Tom, how about if I get you to respond on that because it is clear, there's a lot of frustration about how this investigation is moving forward. We just heard from will who verified that the CHINESE ships are not reporting to australian authorities. So that might explain why australiana autes didn't hear about it directly from the CHINESE but from the news agency,but this also means this method is providingfusion and frustration. So, tom, when you have a multi-national force involved here, some who

So that might explain why australiana autes didn't hear about it directly from the CHINESE but from the news agency,but this also means this method is providingfusion and frustration. So, tom, when you have a multi-national force involved here, some who are cooperating by command post and others who have the assets, but are are doing their own thing, it is difficult to 

is what is likely to happen when you've got kind of, I guess, different captains at the ship, so to speak. 
[02:09:40]



>> It's one thing for the ship to be out there and not have communication with people onshore in australia, but i thought that those aircraft, the CHINESE planes included, were taking off tfrom the same base and I'm curious why they're doing their own search patterns in a completely different area and are they part of the multinational task force or not, and if they're not, okay? But when this gets reported back to CHINA when

But when this gets reported back to CHINA when did CHINA then, send the information. They have telephones between beijing and perth, australia, somebody should be calling somebody else to say here's what we're hearing. Check it out. What will said is true. 
>> Yeah.

sequence events for you or do you prefer to be hopeful about these latest bits of information that are being reported even if it has not beenebeen verified as yet. 
>> I'm looking at it as a that's how things happen point of view or a practical point of view. The CHINESE ship has a reporter onboard and doing his or her job as they do, they'll get the news as quickly as possible and they'll pass the news back to beijing and I'm not surprised at the way this has come down and I'm disappointed because I would want this 

my exposure to accident investigation is that nothing is ever released to the press, media at all of this magnitude. We shouldn't be talking about it right now. I'm very, very disappointed that the joint task force wasn't the immediate go-to people because this is 
-- this is something the CHINESE people and the rest of the families on this airplane really want to know about. 
>> Okay. Tom, yeah, I'm sure they're frustrated as well, but at this point how do you fix it? How do you clean it up? 
>> Fredericka, this is not the press. This is not like 

How do you clean it up? 
>> Fredericka, this is not the press. This is not like the reporters in the u.S. That send it back to their editors in the u.S. And it gets in the newspaper here. Xinhua is owned and operated and controlled by the the CHINESE govern government. That reporter on the ship is an employee of the CHINESE govern am. What gets put in the newspaper is determined by the CHINESE government and it's their ship and plane in that area, so this isn't just a leak to a newspaper like we've had earlier

just a leak to a newspaper like we've had earlier in this investigation from many different newspapers with information from kuala lumpur. This is a government agency putting this out essentially. 
>> Yeah. And richard, you know, I would think the australians would know about this potentia given the way the CHINESE government operates and culturally how it operates and at the same time perhaps there was a feeling of a common goal that everyone wants to get to the bottom of this and there may be this sense of cooperation and maybe australian authorities still feel blind sided even though 

still feel blind sided even though they may recognize there is this potential?

how can you actually find a black box? He said let's wait until tomorrow when we get more information and maybe it will just be another mistake again. And a relative in kuala lumpur said there's no confirmation yet. We are waiting patiently and this relative is right because the CHINESE ministry of transport said on its microblog site be careful. This is not confirmed yet. So we do see the government also being cautious about these reports as well. Now, we've also been tracking social media. There is a big group chat among family members on a social messaging

>> Reporter: Sure. That reporter is someone from cctv which is a government-backed television news station here. There is also another reporter from a shanghai newspaper onboard, as well. That's also a 

also have to wonder was malaysia informed about this possible ping as well as those floating objects? So there is that disconnect in terms of the information flow. I can put this interest context, though, fredericka because early in this search there was a little bit of a fumble from CHINAS part when you remember those satellite photos of the debris in the south CHINA sea.

>> All right. Pauline chiou, thank you very much for that 

these black boxes. The beacon is the device in which once it hits under water that's how sonar equipment is able to detect and locate the beacon which is attached to this flight and data and voice record recorders. Let me go to you, aneesh, because this signal according to CHINESE authorities, they believe this signal will is consistent with the beacons on the boxes. Even australians are acknowledging while the reporting is showing the characteristics are consistent with these devices, they are unable to verify. So in your view, could it be anything else in that general search area 

full speed to the point of exhaustion to have to break away from what they're doing and get over there and have a look at this and I'm not sure what the australians have decided to do or if it's going to be left entirely in the hands of the CHINESE to verify the signal, but it does create a problem with the pace and the tempo of the expedition. 
>> Okay. 
>> And you understand the sounds of the ocean. In your view, is there anything else that would be in this portion of the southern indian ocean that could mimic 

what you're looking at it's hard to understand how sure they are that this is the right frequency.

the ship also heard the signal on friday, but the signal stopped too abruptly to be recorded. Today the joint agency coordination center's chief said that he had been notified about the signal, but there's no confirmation yet that it is connected to the missing plane. Officials also say a CHINESE air force plane spotted several floating white objects earlier today. It's not clear yet if those are connected to the plane either. And now the task is finding out if any of these new, potential clues are indeed linked to the plane's disappearance. We have our teams around the 

reported sightings and detections? 
>> Well, yeah. 3:00 a.M. Here in perth and we know that search effort, the aerial search effort, will be ramping up here at peairs pearce air base. We don't know will the planes go to new area, outside the designated search zone when the CHINESE ship supposedly detected some sort of a ping.

According to a source of ours in the australian defense force, the australian command center got word there was a possible ping detected. They got word around lunchtime on saturday. By the early evening on saturday, when the CHINESE state news agency put out a news bulletin to the world, it took the australian officials by surprise, because they had been trng to get more information, information they just weren't able to get. We know from our source at the australian command center, they were trying to establish 

put out a news bulletin to the world, it took the australian officials by surprise, because they had been trng to get more information, information they just weren't able to get. We know from our source at the australian command center, they were trying to establish a link with the CHINESE ship for more specific details about this supposed ping, but still, now hours later, they haven't been able to establish a link. All the information is having to go through beijing and the information from beijing has been limited at best. We have reached out to the CHINESE government 

with the CHINESE ship for more specific details about this supposed ping, but still, now hours later, they haven't been able to establish a link. All the information is having to go through beijing and the information from beijing has been limited at best. We have reached out to the CHINESE government to try to get a response, and so far we haven't heard back either, fred. 
[00:02:56]



>> Hmm. And so, will, what about the sequence of events? I mean, we're only hours away now from baybreak. Do you know anything about the plan, what planes will get 

a decision will have been made, but this is the decision we have right now and haven't heard anything about ships being re-routed just yet. We just don't have those answers and I suspect it's because we just don't have all of the details we need to get from the CHINESE government about the specifics on this. 
>> All right. Will ripley, thank you so much. So rene marsh in washington, this CHINESE claim raising a lot of key questions. For one, could this really be an indicator of the black box? 
>> Right. So fred, like you said, along with the 

being re-routed just yet. We just don't have those answers and I suspect it's because we just don't have all of the details we need to get from the CHINESE government about the specifics on this. 
>> All right. Will ripley, thank you so much. So rene marsh in washington, this CHINESE claim raising a lot of key questions. For one, could this really be an indicator of the black box? 
>> Right. So fred, like you said, along with the developments come a lot of these key questions. So could it be? Well, the manufacturer of the pingers today did tell 

fred, like you said, along with the developments come a lot of these key questions. So could it be? Well, the manufacturer of the pingers today did tell us that this frequency is so very unique. There's not many things that this could be, but now, behind that is this CHINESE television reporting that the signal was detected every second for 1:30 seconds. That's the part that makes us scratch our heads a bit, because the manufacturer says if these pingers are working, they're constantly pinging. Possible explanation for why this sound was only detected for that short period 

the british ship, this week they also reported a false positive. So to go back to your original question, could this really be the black boxes? It's really hard to say at this point, fred. 
[00:05:36]



>> Hmm. And so since debris also was reportedly spotted by perhaps a CHINESE air ship, should that make searchers more confident that this could be flight 370? 
>> Well, we know that the debris was spotted roughly 55 miles away from where this sound was detected's it was described as white objects, but when you think about this, this debris was spotted in 

black boxes. What they would need to do is locate that pinging sound again. Once they locate the pingi sound, they'd go ahead and deploy ocean mapping equipment to actually find the black box. That's what would be next. I'm not really sure what kind of equipment is onboard the CHINESE ship, but we do know that the australian ship "the ocean shield" has that sort of underwater robot, able to go down on the ocean floor a actually find that black box. Fred? 
[00:08:02]



>> Hmm. Okay. All right. Rene, thank you so much. So many questions still 

couple of hours away from daybreak. What do you expect the australian authorities can do, ought to do, would do at this juncture, in terms of a commit? 
>> No dwhut they'll do. They will look at what they've got. They will get as much information as is possible from the CHINESE and they will make a very quick judgment whether or not it is worth retanking the assets, the ships, the planes, to go and have a look. Now, sure, you can send the planes over to see those white pieces of debris, and to see if there's any debris 

sure, you can send the planes over to see those white pieces of debris, and to see if there's any debris where the ship said it heard the pinging noise, and that's relatively straightforward. If I was a guessing man, I would say that's almost a certainty tomorrow, unless the CHINESE say otherwise. And then they will start thinking of moving more shippers into the area. They will see how far ocean shield is, have ocean shield get there in a reasonable time. What about the british submarine, can that get there? But they won't do any of that until 

before we act. 
>> So, mary, wouldn't it seem that a lot of time has been lost by not moving assets, even while they try to get confirmation or verification? Because if initial reports are that somewhere between 10 and 1278 12 hours prior to this juncture, discussing it, I guess CHINESE authorities made everyone aware of it, australian authorities learned of it, 10 or 12 hours lost now. Why wouldn't they just move the assets as they tried to get verification? 
>> Well, what you said is right, plus now we learned that they had actually heard it the day before, 

learned that they had actually heard it the day before, too, so now we have a day and a half potentially almost two days lost, and i think whahey will do, I mean, richard's probably right, but i think what they will do is try to get confirmation from the CHINESE ship. They've been trying to reach them. They haven't been able to reach them, but once they reach them and say, look, did you hear this on friday and saturday? And I think they will send assets. I don't think they have a choice. As they said, they were 

earlier, that arc that will bring up at some point in time indeed may possibly intersect where that impact area could have been. 
>> All right. Les, rob, richard and mary, thank you so much. 
>>> Stick around. We do have much more to come as it pertains to these two reports. CHINESE news agencies saying that they have a reason to believe that black boxes or at least debris may be in the general vicinity. Still awaiting confirmation from australian authorities. 
>>> And we're now only a few hours away from a new search day in the indian ocean. We'll have much 

education around where you want to go. So, you know, you can get the job you want. Ready, let's get to work. 
[00:17:08]



>>> Welcome back. The latest on the search for flight 370. We're waiting to find out more information about that pulse signal reportedly picked up by CHINESE patrol ship. David gallo joins me by phone from boston, the director of special projects at the woods hole oceanographic institution. All right. So, david, are you optimistic about this report? 
>> Hi, fred. Well, I'm as optimistic as can be, given the circumstances's. It's a sit and wait until 

thz mountains, valleys, all of that stuff can do that to sound. 
[00:19:27]



>> So if the australian navy's open shield, or perhaps even the british ship "echo" which all have that sophisticated listening equipment onboard, if it were to be directed in that same general vicinity where the CHINESE ship was, what would it take for them to try and locate that sound? Is it as simple as somesophisticated mapping of the CHINESE ship, that had may have done? Dropping of an anchor where they would have heard that site? How do they get others to duplicate that 

even the british ship "echo" which all have that sophisticated listening equipment onboard, if it were to be directed in that same general vicinity where the CHINESE ship was, what would it take for them to try and locate that sound? Is it as simple as somesophisticated mapping of the CHINESE ship, that had may have done? Dropping of an anchor where they would have heard that site? How do they get others to duplicate that path?

them to try and locate that sound? Is it as simple as somesophisticated mapping of the CHINESE ship, that had may have done? Dropping of an anchor where they would have heard that site? How do they get others to duplicate that path? 
>> A great question. It matters how the CHINESE located 
-- we're giving a haven't gender location, 1010 degree1010 
-- 101 degrees west. 257 degrees south, something like that. And you know, I don't know if they dropped a, if they got that through gps. It's one thing to know where the surface ship is nap they were 

of listening device, you've got to know where that is and that could easily be a mile or more away from the surface ship. Depends where they were and if that's what's going to happen, you have to listen in and assets in that general vicinity, how else would this CHINESE ship try to verify what they heard? I mean, how do they convince australian authorities or anybody else that we are very much convinced that what we sheared a pulse from the black box? 
>> Sure. One thing they can do, at least I hope, they recorded what they heard 

and I'm i saming they're playing under those guidelines. There's probably a mechanism set up where if you see something, hear something, how you then pass it up the system. It doesn't seem to be what happened so far. It seemed like it came out of the media first. The CHINESE media when we first heard about this. So we'll have to sit back and watch how it's handled from here on in. 
[00:21:49]



>> David gallo, thanks so much. 
>>> Much more on these reported sightings and audio hearing coming from the CHINESE ship, and that it saw debris

>>> All right. News that a CHINESE ship may have heard several pings in the indian ocean is drawing reaction from relatives of passengers on flight 370. Joe joins joins us now from kuala lumpur. This news came in the middle of the night for some folks but what kind of reaction are you getting? 
>> You're 

been through it before. A ray of hope searchers may have found something, so far all of the other hopeful signs have faded away after time. The sparse amount of reaction we've gotten is from people who say they frankly do not know what to think at this stage. A CHINESE family member here said to cnn, there is no confirmation, he said, and we are all simply waiting patiently.

Let's assume that the CHINESE ship actually did hear something, and you have told us that the black box pings happened at a unique frequency. Are you confident these pings couldn't be confused for a different kind of sound like perhaps a military sonar or maybe even a fishing vessel?

the ship also heard the signal on friday, but the signal stopped too abruptly to be recorded. Today the joint agency coordination center's chief said that he had been notified about the signal, but there's no confirmation yet that it is connected to the missing plane. Officials also say a CHINESE air force plane spotted several floating white objects earlier today. It's not clear yet if those are connected to the plane either. And now the task is finding out if any of these new, potential clues are indeed linked to the plane's disappearance. We have our teams around the 

reported sightings and detections? 
>> Well, yeah. 3:00 a.M. Here in perth and we know that search effort, the aerial search effort, will be ramping up here at peairs pearce air base.

According to a source of ours in the australian defense force, the australian command center got word there was a possible ping detected. They got word around lunchtime on saturday. By the early evening on saturday, when the CHINESE state news agency put out a news bulletin to the world, it took the australian officials by surprise, because they had been trng to get more information, information they just weren't able to get.

put out a news bulletin to the world, it took the australian officials by surprise, because they had been trng to get more information, information they just weren't able to get. We know from our source at the australian command center, they were trying to establish a link with the CHINESE ship for more specific details about this supposed ping, but still, now hours later, they haven't been able to establish a link. All the information is having to go through beijing and the information from beijing has been limited at best. We have reached out to the CHINESE government 

with the CHINESE ship for more specific details about this supposed ping, but still, now hours later, they haven't been able to establish a link. All the information is having to go through beijing and the information from beijing has been limited at best. We have reached out to the CHINESE government to try to get a response, and so far we haven't heard back either, fred. 
[00:02:56]



>> Hmm. And so, will, what about the sequence of events? I mean, we're only hours away now from baybreak. Do you know anything about the plan, what planes will get 

a decision will have been made, but this is the decision we have right now and haven't heard anything about ships being re-routed just yet. We just don't have those answers and I suspect it's because we just don't have all of the details we need to get from the CHINESE government about the specifics on this. 
>> All right. Will ripley, thank you so much. So rene marsh in washington, this CHINESE claim raising a lot of key questions. For one, could this really be an indicator of the black box? 
>> Right. So fred, like you said, along with the 

being re-routed just yet. We just don't have those answers and I suspect it's because we just don't have all of the details we need to get from the CHINESE government about the specifics on this. 
>> All right. Will ripley, thank you so much. So rene marsh in washington, this CHINESE claim raising a lot of key questions. For one, could this really be an indicator of the black box?

fred, like you said, along with the developments come a lot of these key questions. So could it be? Well, the manufacturer of the pingers today did tell us that this frequency is so very unique. There's not many things that this could be, but now, behind that is this CHINESE television reporting that the signal was detected every second for 1:30 seconds. That's the part that makes us scratch our heads a bit, because the manufacturer says if these pingers are working, they're constantly pinging. Possible explanation for why this sound was only detected for that short period 

the british ship, this week they also reported a false positive. So to go back to your original question, could this really be the black boxes? It's really hard to say at this point, fred. 
[00:05:36]



>> Hmm. And so since debris also was reportedly spotted by perhaps a CHINESE air ship, should that make searchers more confident that this could be flight 370? 
>> Well, we know that the debris was spotted roughly 55 miles away from where this sound was detected's it was described as white objects, but when you think about this, this debris was spotted in 

black boxes. What they would need to do is locate that pinging sound again. Once they locate the pingi sound, they'd go ahead and deploy ocean mapping equipment to actually find the black box. That's what would be next. I'm not really sure what kind of equipment is onboard the CHINESE ship, but we do know that the australian ship "the ocean shield" has that sort of underwater robot, able to go down on the ocean floor a actually find that black box. Fred? 
[00:08:02]



>> Hmm. Okay. All right. Rene, thank you so much. So many questions still 

couple of hours away from daybreak. What do you expect the australian authorities can do, ought to do, would do at this juncture, in terms of a commit? 
>> No dwhut they'll do. They will look at what they've got. They will get as much information as is possible from the CHINESE and they will make a very quick judgment whether or not it is worth retanking the assets, the ships, the planes, to go and have a look. Now, sure, you can send the planes over to see those white pieces of debris, and to see if there's any debris 

sure, you can send the planes over to see those white pieces of debris, and to see if there's any debris where the ship said it heard the pinging noise, and that's relatively straightforward. If I was a guessing man, I would say that's almost a certainty tomorrow, unless the CHINESE say otherwise. And then they will start thinking of moving more shippers into the area. They will see how far ocean shield is, have ocean shield get there in a reasonable time. What about the british submarine, can that get there? But they won't do any of that until 

before we act. 
>> So, mary, wouldn't it seem that a lot of time has been lost by not moving assets, even while they try to get confirmation or verification? Because if initial reports are that somewhere between 10 and 1278 12 hours prior to this juncture, discussing it, I guess CHINESE authorities made everyone aware of it, australian authorities learned of it, 10 or 12 hours lost now. Why wouldn't they just move the assets as they tried to get verification? 
>> Well, what you said is right, plus now we learned that they had actually heard it the day before, 

learned that they had actually heard it the day before, too, so now we have a day and a half potentially almost two days lost, and i think whahey will do, I mean, richard's probably right, but i think what they will do is try to get confirmation from the CHINESE ship. They've been trying to reach them. They haven't been able to reach them, but once they reach them and say, look, did you hear this on friday and saturday? And I think they will send assets. I don't think they have a choice. As they said, they were 

earlier, that arc that will bring up at some point in time indeed may possibly intersect where that impact area could have been. 
>> All right. Les, rob, richard and mary, thank you so much. 
>>> Stick around. We do have much more to come as it pertains to these two reports. CHINESE news agencies saying that they have a reason to believe that black boxes or at least debris may be in the general vicinity. Still awaiting confirmation from australian authorities. 
>>> And we're now only a few hours away from a new search day in the indian ocean. We'll have much 

education around where you want to go. So, you know, you can get the job you want. Ready, let's get to work. 
[00:17:08]



>>> Welcome back. The latest on the search for flight 370. We're waiting to find out more information about that pulse signal reportedly picked up by CHINESE patrol ship. David gallo joins me by phone from boston, the director of special projects at the woods hole oceanographic institution. All right. So, david, are you optimistic about this report? 
>> Hi, fred. Well, I'm as optimistic as can be, given the circumstances's. It's a sit and wait until 

thz mountains, valleys, all of that stuff can do that to sound. 
[00:19:27]



>> So if the australian navy's open shield, or perhaps even the british ship "echo" which all have that sophisticated listening equipment onboard, if it were to be directed in that same general vicinity where the CHINESE ship was, what would it take for them to try and locate that sound? Is it as simple as somesophisticated mapping of the CHINESE ship, that had may have done? Dropping of an anchor where they would have heard that site? How do they get others to duplicate that 

even the british ship "echo" which all have that sophisticated listening equipment onboard, if it were to be directed in that same general vicinity where the CHINESE ship was, what would it take for them to try and locate that sound? Is it as simple as somesophisticated mapping of the CHINESE ship, that had may have done? Dropping of an anchor where they would have heard that site? How do they get others to duplicate that path?

them to try and locate that sound? Is it as simple as somesophisticated mapping of the CHINESE ship, that had may have done? Dropping of an anchor where they would have heard that site? How do they get others to duplicate that path? 
>> A great question. It matters how the CHINESE located 
-- we're giving a haven't gender location, 1010 degree1010 
-- 101 degrees west. 257 degrees south, something like that. And you know, I don't know if they dropped a, if they got that through gps. It's one thing to know where the surface ship is nap they were 

of listening device, you've got to know where that is and that could easily be a mile or more away from the surface ship. Depends where they were and if that's what's going to happen, you have to listen in and assets in that general vicinity, how else would this CHINESE ship try to verify what they heard? I mean, how do they convince australian authorities or anybody else that we are very much convinced that what we sheared a pulse from the black box? 
>> Sure. One thing they can do, at least I hope, they recorded what they heard 

and I'm i saming they're playing under those guidelines. There's probably a mechanism set up where if you see something, hear something, how you then pass it up the system. It doesn't seem to be what happened so far. It seemed like it came out of the media first. The CHINESE media when we first heard about this. So we'll have to sit back and watch how it's handled from here on in. 
[00:21:49]



>> David gallo, thanks so much.

>> You're 

been through it before. A ray of hope searchers may have found something, so far all of the other hopeful signs have faded away after time. The sparse amount of reaction we've gotten is from people who say they frankly do not know what to think at this stage.

Let's talk about all of this and these new developments with the president of duquesne c-com, the company that delivered the original flight data recorders. Let's assume that the CHINESE ship actually did hear something, and you have told us that the black box pings happened at a unique frequency. Are you confident these pings couldn't be confused for a different kind of sound like perhaps a military sonar or maybe even a fishing vessel? 
>> Well, good question, and 

you hear one and the other one is adjacent or nearby, you're going to hear a second ping. It won't be synchronized. The units don't talk to each other, so you will hear two independent pings at that same frequency and same pulse rate. 
>> And according to the reporting, the CHINESE are saying the sound they heard was not continuous but lasted maybe for about a minute and a half. Is that a viable description of how a pinger just might work? Does that sound, you know, like a pinger with perhaps a dying battery? 
>> Well, it's hard to say. 

understanding as to what will happen come day break? 
>> Reporter: Well, it's pretty unclear at the moment. What we understand from the australians who are leading the search effort, the international search effort here, is that they've been trying over the past several hours to be in contact with the CHINESE vessel that detected this pulse coming from this area which apparently was outside of the designated search zone, but they've been unable to do so to get any further details of what exactly they found. And so that's something that they're waiting to hear from. They've been in contact

>>> A possible break-through today in the search for flight 370. A CHINESE ship discovers a pulse signal coming across the same frequency used by so-called black boxes. Joining me now to discuss, anish patel, president of pinger manufacturer duquesne seacom, MILES O'BRIEN, AND rob McCollum. Good to see all of you. Rob, to you first, how confident are you that this 

all this, but I do know that the type of signal that they are reporting would lead you to believe that it is, in fact, the pinger for one of the black boxes. What's interesting to me is how they got to this location, what sorts of assets did the CHINESE use to get to this location they may not be sharing with everybody. I doubt this was just a lucky shot in the dark. 
>> And the why, of course, because no one is clear on why they would be in that particular vicinity when it's about 100 miles off 

not be sharing with everybody. I doubt this was just a lucky shot in the dark. 
>> And the why, of course, because no one is clear on why they would be in that particular vicinity when it's about 100 miles off course from the concentrated search area. So, anish, the CHINESE ship actually detected the signal two separate times we understand, once on friday and then again today, saturday. Does that tell you anything? Does that, I guess, lend more credence to, you know, what they heard? 
>> Well, I'd like to think so. The longer and the more often they 

then also as we talked about, the battery output. As we approach the end of life, that signal is going to become weaker and you're going to have to be closer to it to hear it. 
>> It might become weaker, but would it be intermittent because we're hearing from the CHINESE news agency it was about a minute and a half in which the signal was picked up. What would be the best explanation in your view if this, indeed, is the pulse of a black box? 
>> Typically the signal is not intermittent. Maybe it's weaker and it's harder to 

typically even in the united states when there's a criminal investigation going on and it involves a ane, the cockpit recordings are not released to the public, fred. 
>> And then I know it's in the middle of the night, but malaysian authorities, what, if anything, are they saying about these CHINESE news reports that something might have been detected in the water off the coast of australia? 
>> Very little, quite frankly. There was a tweet that went out from the transport minister earlier this evening which simply talked about prayers and hope, but certainly no confirmation because no one has 

minister earlier this evening which simply talked about prayers and hope, but certainly no confirmation because no one has that at this stage, fred. 
>> Okay. And then clearly a lot of criticism, there has been from the very beginning, about how messy this investigation has unfolded, and now you have CHINESE authorities that are not necessarily reporting the information to malaysian authorities. Malaysian authorities who want to pass on the information to australian authorities. What is the response about the criticism now being lodged against malaysia and, quite frankly, all of the countries involved?
