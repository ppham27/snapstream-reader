[00:06:27]


>> Hi, good to see you guys and good to be down here, once again, for new year's eve for 2013 coming up very shortly. Do you know what? Like you're saying it's not too bad today, temperatures HERE IN MID-30s. Wind is not too bad that. Is the key point. Because when you're higher up, this morning I was with times square ball 20 stories high. It was very cold outside. The wind make things ba.D not too bad. A lot of people out here today enjoying temperatures in MID-30s. Last year was much warmer as YOU MENTIONED, IN THE MID-40s But today it's looking g dry out here. There is a storm further off course but bringing in rin across portions of texas up into western parts of tennessee. Those people will need to use umbrellas but here in new york city it's a beautiful evening. We're going to be enjoying it tonight. Back to you. 
>> That is what we care about. Thank you. I have a secret weapon by the way this time of the year. 
>> What is it?. 
>> I'll tell you later. I'm experimenting to see whether or not it will keep me warmer than usual. 
>> Oh. Okay. 
>> We'll look forward to that. 
>> Yes. You will. 
>> Still ahead some thoughts on 2013 from shepherd smith, bret baier and fox and friends team and pat benetar shares one of her popular songs. 
>> And from the heart of 

[00:11:17]


>> a big, overwhelming, bipartisan super majority, 89 votes will put the pressure on the house this. Might take a day or two in the house, to be honest with you. We don't know how quickly they can do this. But we have been down this road before, just a little more than a year ago, there was a similar vote, 89 votes, in fact, on the payroll tax, renewing the payroll tax and they presented this to the house members and they absolutely got their heads handed to them, the g.O.P. Leadership. It took a lot of movement by speaker john boehner who had to get everybody out of town and unilaterally passed the bill -- his own, getting his republican members out of town. So this is going to be a very, you know, sketchy situation for the house of representatives. 
>> So this deal, absolutely not a sure thing, as far as passing in the house of representatives and we need to emphasize, chad, even if it does pass, this is just a temporary bill. It was just designed to stave off those automatic spending cuts and tax hikes for a cume of months. The word pundits keep using is kicking the can down the road. This has to be re-addressed in two months, when this temporary bill, somewhat expire, correct? 
>> Yeah. That's the real problem here this. Deals with only the discretionary spending parted of the budget, the part of the budget that congress is in charge of. Everything else that is off buet, which is entitlement spending, medicare, medicaid, social security, there is nothing in this to touch that. That's really what draws theire of conservatives because that's the main thing that drives up the debt. They still haven't gotten their hands wrapped around that. Even on the discretionary side of the budget, the part that congress does have its hands on, they basically haven't done anything. As you say, they have kicked the can down the road, one more time. 
>> Speaking of that, the other thing this bill does not address at all is the debt ceiling, which we did hit yesterday. But of course, treasury circuit tim geithner has put in emergency spending measures that are going to forestall that crisis, again, for another couple of months. So we are going to be dealing with that issue again in february or so, also. 

[00:13:24]


>> Absolutely. That's something the house republicans and conservatives are looking at very carefully because they view that as a points of leverage. In other words, if we are going to have to increase the debt ceiling and remember the budget they approved by paul ryan, increases the debt ceiling multiple times over the next few years, they view that as an opportunity to get an agreement to draw down spenning and to change the entitlement calculations and that's where you really start to make an impact. This was the trade-off -- remember, the trade-off in december of 2011 for the budget control act was to raise the debt ceiling in exchange for getting $1.2 trillion in cuts. And those gl 1.2 trillion were going to come in an agreement by the super committee -- which failed -- or the sequester -- which guess what? They just turned off for two months. So we are right back to where we were in august of 2011. 
>> Right. And again, just to recap, this dpeel right now, temporary deal has passed in the senate. It is due for a vote probably sometime later today in the house, where passage is not exactly clear. But either way, it is just a temporary bill that's going to put off some of these issues for a while. We did technically, go off the cliff, at midnight. But officials are pointing out that, since january 1 is a holiday, none of it was going to be implemented anyway. And if the house does vote on this today, january 1, then this deal can take effect by january 2. Then we didn't actually go off the cliff. It was! More like a bungee jump as one pundit put it. Correct, chad? 
>> Yeah, yeah. I would be careful about reading too much into the house of representatives voting on it today. They are to sort of see where their members are. You know, there is something that john boehner and the house republican leadership has operated under a line, the haster rule, they would never bring a piece of legislation to the floor that did not have a majority of the majority party. Now, we would think that the democrats would be with the blessing of the president and joe biden, the vice-president, coming up to capitol hill, that they would get a pretty good democratic vote. But the democrats don't want to have to carry the water on this. They are not in charge in the house of representatives. If the house coughs up 50 to 70 votes and then have you the democrats say, carry the rest of the weight, that causes two problems. The democrats look like this is swung around their neck like a mill stone. And number 2, the conservative, tell draw theirire because they will turn the heat on john boehner and say, wait a minute! This isn't what we wanted. Why in the world would you bring this to the house floor? That could be a problem for john boehner. 

[00:16:08]


>> Reporting live from capitol hill. Thank you. Briefly, some of what is in this deal, taxes increasing for individuals who make more than $400,000, households making more than $450 and capital gains tax increase to 20%. The alternative minimum tax permanently patched to keep it from affecting more. The estate tax will have a $10 million exemption. And tell extend stimulus tax credits and unemployment and for children, unearned income. We return to the all-american Danica millions copd, breathing becomemes a struggle.

>> Good pint. 
>> Happy new year, eefsh nicely done. Thank you. Wonderful colleagues but both. I feel the wind shifting. Do you? 
>> Before it was okay. When it comes from this direction down 7th avenue, we're in trouble. 
>> It's fun for people at home braving these temperatures in 20 miles per hour winds we do it so you don't have to. John scott gets ready for his debut performance. We've got new year crowds ready for anything as well. 
>> We've got to go to the co-host of the five right here, kimberly who I believe, yes she s she's live. 
>> Hi, kim. 
>> With ryan reid we're having a great time. We just escaped that soccer break up in the van. Say hi. 
>> Hey, megyn bill. Kimberly just hit on me and asked me if I was married. 
>> I was trying to find a proposal but thought I'd take one myself. 
>> We heard they're going to make a lot of bob beckel looking babies later. 
>> That is an ugly thought. 
>> He was a cute baby right? 
>> Absolutely. 
>> I don't think proposal is the way to go but the new year's eve divorce. 
>> That is the new thing. You have a divorce party. 
>> Sure. Five, four, I'm seeing your cousin. 
>> What? 
>> Exactly we're going to let you know how this works out laitder. 
>> Nice. Take a picture. 
>> Before you go, very to ask you quickly. I have to ask you if a proposal comes to you on new year's eve in times square is it cheesey or great? 

[00:22:16]


>> I think it's fantastic. I'm all about love. Pro pose away is what I say. 
>> All right. 
>> You don't want to know where her hand is now. 
>> He asked me if I had money. He wants to marry me for my money. I don't know. 
>> We'll go back to them after midnight. 
>> Right on. After the kids go to bed. 
>> Kimberly, stay cool. We'll be back to you in just a moment. 
>> Our next guest, one of her first songs was a second video ever aired o a brand new cable network called mtv. 
>> Pat benatar is rocking new year's eve in new york city. Ball drop coming up. 38 minutes and counting. 
>> I'm near safe began stan. I want to say to my mom, little brother and grandmother in new orleans happy holidays. And see you guys soon. Before before for those making $250,000 or less and republicans setting the bar higher than that. This deal calls for taxes to go up for people making $400,000 or more a year or for households making $450,000 a iear. Do you think that decision will stand in future bills? 

[00:28:43]


>> Well, it is possible. I mean I think that, you know, this was a negotiation and the republicans said, remember, they wanted a million dollars at one point. Up to a million dollars. So this came up a little bi higher. There was one point where president obama said well, i would be willing to come up a little bit higher. Tom harkin, democratic senator from iowa who now the that was too high and he was one of three democratic no's on the bill. Again, they have give and little bit on the tax policy there. I thought what was interesting is the estate tax here. You have big land owners out west how they, you know, indexed the estate tax here and there were some republican senators and repcan lawmakers who represent districts or states that have big plots of land and they kind of like that because they had people who owned a lot of property, ranchers in particular who was just getten eaten up by the tax policy when it came to the estate tax and so this helps them out. 
>> A lot of interesting items in this bill which we will be chewing on for the next few days. I guess if the house passes it. 
>> Yep, and don't forget about dairy. That is something else that is in there. A lot of people were concerned milk prices were are going to double in the next couple of weeks. Provision in here that renews most of the farm bill for nine months basically until september. The main problem with that in the near term was milk prices that milk prices could double in the next couple of weeks. They have been able to shut that off and again, that is where you get to the house of representatives and maybe not everybody likes the tax provisions but there is something in there for everybody. Maybe it is the milk. Maybe the estate tax. Maybe something else. 
>> All right. So it remains to be seen how this is all going to be fleshed out. Chad pergram, thank you so much for joining us you. 
>> Any time. 
>> I'm patti ann browne. We now return you to our all american new year's 2013 with megyn kelly and bill hemmer.. ?????? [ Music ] ??????. ?????? [ Music ] ??????. ?????? [ Music ] ??????. ??????

>> Yeah. Yeah. 
>> They had a high school love. He would be neil. She would be pat. They'd -- . 
>> It's a great day. On the 8 track. We're transition of the evening. Love is not the only battlefield we're talking about tonight. 
>> Love. 
>> How do you call that love? 
>> We tried not to do it. 
>> We didn't want to do it. 
>> Your friends down in washington, they made us do this. 
>> Yes. 
>> Because that is it. The other battlefield. 
>> Here we go, washington update on the fc. And as we mentioned we're following two countdowns right now. doug McElway, I'm sorry. I have to be here, on new year's eve. 
>> We hope your families, we know your family is in a better place. 
>> Can you like fed yechl me a hip flask or something like that? 
>> You and everyone in that town need it like that. 
>> I think there is additional brandy somewhere here. 
>> Feels so wrong. 
>> I'm going to bring you up to date on ts stuff. The senate is in recess now subject to a call. When the session resumes probably about the same time the ball drops we expect a vote on a bill to avert the fiscal cliff. One that has bipartisan support is how apparently washington likes to celebrate new year's eve, 2013. Listen to joe biden. 
>> Happy new year. 
>> Happy new year. 

[00:35:32]


>> That, that has been happy new year, nobody here seem that's thrilled with celebrating new year's eve this he way with the light on. Nor with the bill that has been crafted. Selling this measure to extreme wing of both parties may be difficult. Sharon brown a liberal democrat says he's a yes vote. Saying it's imperfect but addresses key sticking point. 
>> We need to protect american families and job creators from this looming tax hike. Everyone agrees that that action is necessary. And I can rrt that we've reached an agreement on all of the tax, the tax issues. 
>> So, why the delay in the senate vote tonight? According to senate majority leader they still have to get a price tag from congressional budget office. As to the rest of the substance of the bill here is what we know. The measure raising taxes by $600 billion over 10 years compared with pol that expire midnight monday and would delay would two months those spending cuts slashing the budgets of the pentagon and a lot of domestic programs as well. And we've got a lot of other highlights but get down into the weeds and it's virtually unfathomable especially if you've hd a bottle of champagne or two. 
>> Tailor swift just came on the stage behind us. 
>> Is it over? 
>> Base ond what we heard today, her taxes are going up, she's not happy bit. 
>> Doug, god bless you for being here as late as you are. It's not our fault. 
>> It's true. 
>> You come back if there is news, okay? Thank you. 
>> Okay. 
>> Happy new year to you. 
>> And people who are staying home now, watching times square on new year's eve, do they want to hear about the fc? 
>> It's a huge deal. 
>> I know. But it's new year's eve. 
>> It's important. 

[00:37:32]


>> Can we just have one night not bother bid those people down in washington? 
>> I think fantasy is that for to us think they'll get it done. On time. 
>> Let's skt crowd here in times square. How do you feel about us not talking about the fiscal cliff anymore? 
>> Woe, that is great. 
>> Look. Look. Look how happy they are. 
>> That is the moment of the night. Yes. 
>> That is what we thought. Up next, one of the greatest stories of rock history will play out on our times square stage. 
>> That is right. We're 22 minutes from the big ball drop. All american new year's eve is become in three minutes, 2013 is that far away. 
>> Hi, I'm in afghanistan and want to say hi to family in new jersey my wife and daughter. Happy holidays I'll be home, soon. 
>> Hi. I want say happy holidays to my family and friends in california and hi to my husband, bill, my kids, I love you. I miss you. See you guys soon.

You hug your family closer keep your friends tighter enjoy special moments more. Do you that and you have all of that, I guarantee you, it's going to be a priceless new year. Make it special. Happy new year.

>> I couldn't agree more. 
>> Let's welcome a new chapter and start anew. 
>> It ended so sadly, too. With the tragedy in newtown, which I know you covered beautifully. But you think about families out there hurting you and just think, count your blessings on a night like tonight. Count your blessings to be with your family, to be safe and to have love and in f.Not, turning a page in which you can find those things. 
>> I drove back into new york city two weeks ago tonight after spending time in newtown. And sandy hook. I just think millions and i speak on behalf of millions of americans just more grateful to have their family and good friends close to them, especially because of what happened there two and a half weeks ago.

>> Happy new year. 
>> Great to have you back. 
>> Well done. 
>> Thank you. 
>> So now, billions watched the ball drop. Washington lawmakers with a bigger ball of their own. All on their own. 
>> They make us do this. 
>> We're doing it under protest. 
>> I to not say fiscal cliff. 
>> Voices say read the prompter. The prommer says the white house had agreed on a plan to prevent taxes going up. The deadline passed. Where do we stand? 
>> What is going on? 
>> The vice president going to come out? Did they? No. This is the city we live n the ultimate contrast. This is dullsville. We're waiting for the senate reset to end. Acting slowly. We have been told not to expect votes and perhaps until 3:00 or 4:00 in the morning. Most indicators are that it stands a good chance of passage in the senate. Last word we got came from vice president joe biden. Just minutes ago. Here is the vice president. 
>> I feel very good about how is vote is going to go. Having been in the senate, there are two things you shouldn't do. You shouldn't predict how the senate is going vote before they vote. You won't make a lot of money. Two, you shouldn't predict how the house is going to vote. 

[01:10:52]


>> House will not vote on this fiscal cliff bill until tomorrow. We've heard from the house leadership that this bill will not be voted on there until voted n in the senate. Not until house leadership has had time to review the bill. Tax on high income earners, it will produce $620 billion in revenue. Unemployment eninsurance, $30 billion from one year, not going to be paid for with other costs. There are no spending cuts in this bill that. Is going to happen -- have to be taken up at a later date. So big question mark whether or not the house, republican led house is going to go for that. Back to you. 
>> A vote at 3:00 or 4:00 in the morning 
>> correct. In the morning. 
>> Yes. 
>> I'll be here. 
>> Can we talk about something else now? 
>> Thank you. 
>> Happy new year. 
>> Here we are somewhere over the rainbow. It's kind of fitting. 
>> Yes. 
>> Searching for a pot of gold. 
>> Who wants to talk about that? Let's talk about we're going to change everything. Lose that five pounds, we're going to go to the gym, exercise. 
>> Spend more time in the family and friends. Remember what is important in life! Up next lnz. 
>> At least for the first week. 
>> An aamazing performanceance from sarah brightman. She has one beautiful voice. Happy new year! 
>> I want to wish friends and family a happy holidays. I love you. I miss you. See you soon. 16 minutes in 2013. Cold out here. 

[01:16:20]


>> It's funky when you see the new number. You see 2013. 
>> I know. 13 has that I don't know how i feel bit. 
>> It could be lumy -- lucky 13.

>> In just minutes sarah will be back with a special performance to end your holiday season. 
>> Stay tuned for that. 
>> Happy new year! was it? Yes, it was. I'm so glad we could be here for larry. At a time like this, friends and family matter most. Even preparing this lunch is a help, emotionally and financially. Mm, it's true. I was surprised to hear there was no life insurance. Funerals are so expensive. I hope larry can afford it. I know. That's why I'm glad I got a policy through the colonial penn program. It gives me peace of mind to know I can help my family with some of those expenses. You know, I've been shopping for life insurance. Do you think they have coverage for me, something that would fit into my budget? Yes. You can get permanent coverage for less than 35 cents a day. If you're between 50 and 85, your acceptance is guaranteed. You won't have to take a physical or answer any health questions. Oh, really? With my health, I didn't think I'd qualify. You can't be turned down because of your health. Plus, your costs will never go up, and your coverage will never go down. Okay. I'm convinced. I'm going to give them a call. Are you between the ages of 50 and 85? Did you think that quality insurance at an affordable rate is out of your reach? If you answered yes to these questions, then you should call about the colonial penn program now. For less than 35 cents a day, you can get affordable life insurance with guaranteed acceptance. There are no health questions or medical exam. You cannot be turned down because of your health. So, whether you're getting new insurance or supplementing coverage you already have, join the six million people who have called about the colonial penn program. Ask one of their representatives about a plan that meets yourneeds. They're waiting to hear from you, so call now. I've put this off long enough. I'm definitely gonna call about the colonial penn program.

>> We hope your families, we know your family is in a better place. 
>> Can you like fed yechl me a hip flask or something like that? 
>> You and everyone in that town need it like that. 
>> I think there is additional brandy somewhere here. 
>> Feels so wrong. 
>> I'm going to bring you up to date on this stuff. The senate is in recess now subject to a call. When the session resumes probably about the same time the ball drops we expect a vote on a bill to avert the fiscal cliff. One that has bipartisan support is how apparently washington likes to celebrate new year's eve, 2013. Listen to joe biden. 
>> Happy new year. 
>> Happy new year. 

[00:35:31]


>> That, that has been happy new year, nobody here seem that's thrilled with celebrating new year's eve this he way with the light on. Nor with the bill that has been crafted. Selling this measure to extreme wing of both parties may be difficult. Sharon brown a liberal democrat says he's a yes vote. Saying it's imperfect but addresses key sticking point. 
>> We need to protect american families and job creators from this looming tax hike. Everyone agrees that that action is necessary. And I can rrt that we've reached an agreement on all of the tax, the tax issues. 
>> So, why the delay in the senate vote tonight? According to senate majority leader they still haveo get a price tag from congressional budget office. As to the rest of the substance of the bill here is what we know. The measure raising taxes by $600 billion over 10 years compared with policies that expire midnight monday and would delay would two months those spending cuts slashing the budgets of the pentagon and a lot of domestic programs as well. And we've got a lot of other highlights but get down into the weeds and it's virtually unfathomable especially if you've hd a bottle of champagne or two. 
>> Tailor swift just came on the stage behind us. 
>> Is it over? 
>> Base ond what we heard today, her taxes are going up, she's not happy bit. 
>> Doug, god bless you for being here as late as you are. It's not our fault. 
>> It's true. 
>> You come back if there is news, okay? Thank you. 
>> Okay. 
>> Happy new year to you. 
>> And people who are staying home now, watching times square on new year's eve, do they want to hear about the fc? 
>> It's a huge deal. 
>> I know. But it's new year's eve. 
>> It's important. 
>> Can we just have one night not bother bid those people down in washington? 

[00:37:35]


>> I think fantasy is that for to us think they'll get it done. On time. 
>> Let's skt crowd here in times square. How do you feel about us not talking about the fiscal cliff anymore? >>, That is great. 
>> Look. Look. Look how happy they are. 
>> That is the moment of the night. Yes. 
>> That is what we thought. Up next, one of the greatest stories of rock history will play out on our times square stage. 
>> That is right. We're 22 minutes from the big ball drop. All american new year's eve is become in three minutes, 2013 is that far away. 
>> Hi, I'm in afghanistan and want to say hi to family in new jersey my wife and daughter. Happy holidays I'll be home, soon. 
>> Hi. I want say happy holidays to my family and friends in california and hi to my husband, bill, my kids, I love you. I miss you. See you guys soon. 

[00:41:29]

You hug your family closer keep your friends tighter enjoy special moments more. Do you that and you have all of that, I guarantee you it's going to be a priceless new year. Make it special.

>> I to not say fiscal cliff. 
>> Voices say read the prompter. The prommer says the white house had agreed on a plan to prevent taxes going up. The deadline passed. Where do we stand? 
>> What is going on? 
>> The vice president going to come out? Did they? No. This is the city we live n the ultimate contrast. This is dullsville. We're waiting for the senate reset to end. Acting slowly. We have been told not to expect votes and perhaps until 3:00 or 4:00 in the morning. Most indicators are that it stands a good chance of passage in the senate. Last word we got came from vice president joe biden. Just minutes ago. Here is the vice president. 
>> I feel very good about how is vote is going to go. Having been in the senate, there are two things you shouldn't do. You shouldn't predict how the senate is going vote before they vote. You won't make a lot of money. Two, you shouldn't predict how the house is going to vote. 
>> House will not vote on this fiscal cliff bill until tomorrow. We've heard from the house leadership that this bill will not be voted on there until voted n in the senate. Not until house leadership has had time to review the bill. Tax on high income earners, it will produce $620 billion in revenue. Unemployment eninsurance, $30 billion from one year, not going to be paid for with other costs. There are no spending cuts in this bill that. Is going to happen -- have to be taken up at a later date. So big question mark whether or not the house, republican led house is going to go for that. Back to you. 

[01:11:38]


>> A vote at 3:00 or 4:00 in the morning 
>> correct. In the morning. 
>> Yes. 
>> I'll be here.

=======================================================

>>> The bill has amended is passed. 
>> It's a deal. Just hours after the east coast rings in the new year the senate overwhelmingly passes a bill to stop the country from falling off the fiscal cliff. But as 2013 is officially rung in, we're still technically going over the edge of the cliff. As of right now we have no word on what the house of representatives will do. But, as we wait we'll walk you through the bill's details and tell you who's impacted and how. 
>> Ale're learning more about secretary of state hillary clinton's blood clot in her head that sent her to the hospital. The latest on her treatment and prognosis. Good morning, everyone, welcome to "early start." Well to a special edition, the fiscal cliff edition. We're over the fiscal cliff. I'm john berman. 
>> I'm ali velshi. It's hard to do this after that crazy night of partying. 
>> Yeah, right. I'm christine romans. Zoraida is off today. It's 5:00 a.M. In the east. Let's get you started. 
>>> Of course as you all know because you were glued to it all night, america kicked off the new year by falling offer the fiscal cliff. But, in breaking news this morning, we're talking just hours ago, there is now a deal in place that could cushion that blow. Here's what happed while you were sleeping. Or sipping champagne or doing something else. On eleventh hour agreement crafted by vice president joe BIDEN AND mitch McConnell in the senate has been passed by the senate by a margin of 89-8. That vote just took place a couple hours ago. Now, it's up to the republican-controlled house to take up that plan later this morning, and that is where it gets very interesting. If the house approves, and it's a big if, the deal would generate an estimated $600 billion in new revenues over the next ten years. Here are some more of the details. Under the plan, bush-era tax cuts remain in place for individuals earning less than $400,000 a year, families earning less than $450,000. Unemployment benefits for 2 million americans extended for a year. Theternative minimum tax will be permanently adjusted for inflation. And as for spending cuts, pretty much that gets kicked down the road for another two months. 

[00:02:19]


>> I'm disappointed that we weren't able to make the grand bargain as we had tried to do for so long. But we tried. 
>> So it took an imperfect solution to prevent our constituents from a very real financial pain. But in my view, it was worth the effort. 
>> So honest to goodness, washington was up all night and not for the normal new year's reasons. This was a long time coming. The senate just passing this a short time ago. I'm joined now by white house correspondent brianna keilar, up all night, also, no doubt. She is in washington. She was watching this vote with all of us. What happens now? 
>> Well, it could be as soon as today that the house would vote, john. There's a little bit of uncertainty here. But I think that is the expectation that we're still waiting to see that definitely today. President obama putting out a statement last night saying while neither democrats nor republicans got everything they wanted, this agreement is the right thing to do for our country and the house should pass it without delay. But the thing is, you will have to wait and see. Speaker boehner will have to meet first with his conference, and he will have to see where they are on this. He'll have to sell this plan to them. But presumably, because mitch McCONNELL NEGOTIATED THIS AND HE Was doing so, certainly, with an eye to what could get through the house of representatives, and also because it passed with such overwhelming support, the expectation, I think, is that this will be able to make its way through the house. Of course it comes down to the rank and file house republicans. As you know, they have been difficult to please on this issue. And if there isn't a vote on this bill outright, if they really don't like it, they could propose to amend it. Make some changes, and then send it back to the senate, which would take a little more time, obviously. But the thought here is now that we're over the cliff, house republicans would be voting for a tax cut, instead of for a tax hike, and because of that, the house republicans, more of them, may be able to support this. 
>> Brianna, we will be speaking to a number of house members over the course of the morning. Are they going to vote yea or nay on this. Let me ask you this, what was the president's role and the white house role as we headed into this overnight vote last night? 

[00:04:28]


>> Well, obviously, I think leading into what you saw was vice president biden being very involved, and in a way he served very much as the president's proxy. This is something that has taken a lot of the president's attention. But some people, I was actually asked yesterday, you know, what was he doing? Because it seemed like joe biden was very much in charge. Well, the fact is, biden was actually very much an extension of him and it sort of makes sense when you think of the rhythm of how congress works. The president, of course, served in the senate. Joe biden served in the senate for decades alongside mitch McCONNELL. And it was really, I think, that relationship, and sort of his knowing the rhythm of congress. And also, frankly, the deadline that helped kind of push this along. 
>> Brianna keilar in washington, thanks for being with us. We'll talk to you again real soon 
>> staying in the capital now with jonathan allen. Senior congressional correspondent for politico. John, give us some sense of the word from the house this morning. Because we're going to spend a lot of time telling all those folks who might have been doing something other than paying attention to what was going on with the fiscal cliff overnight what the details of the plans are. We wasting our breath? Is this going to make it through the house? 
>> The message we're hearing from house republicans now is that one of two things is going to happen. They're either going to attempt to amend this bill and send it back to the senate with something that the house republicans like better. But failing that, and of course they failed to do that with their plan "b" last week, failing that sounds like john boehner will put this on the floor to see if it can pass with a mix of democratic and republican votes. 
>> Let's think about that. I mean, this was -- it got overwhelming democratic support in the senate. And there were really some doubts about that last night. There were a number of democrats in the senate who really expressed concern, therere a number of progressives in this country who expressed concern with this as well as conservatives. Does the overwhelming majority in the senate influence those democrats in the house who could really take this over the finish line? 
>> Well, really, the pressure is on the other side on republicans, both pressure and cover. That 89-8 vote says that the entire senate essentially is behind this thing. That puts pressure on republicans in the house whose home state senators have already voted for it. And it gives them cover because those home state senators have already voted for it. If everybody joins hands and jumps off together, there's a little bit of shared faith, a little bit of a ability to sell back home. As far as the democrats go, i think the president's not going to have a whole lot of trouble as evidenced by the vote in the senate, not going to have a whole lot of trouble getting his guys on board. They will complain a bit. They'll moan about it. And of course they still have to read it. This thing was not publicly available last night when the senate voted on it. So the house members are going to wake up this morning, and they may very well be the first people to read it in its entirety. 

[00:07:16]


>> Let me ask you about this, about 50 very republican conservative members of the house gave john boehner trouble a little over a week ago with plan "b." They now have in many cases have the cover of their home state senators voting in favor of it and they've got grover norquist who says this bill's okay. So do you think they bow to that pressure? 
>> I'm not sure necessarily that those 50 republicans that have been the hardest nuts for john boehner to crack will necessarily bow because of this bill. But what I do think is that john boehner is in a position now where he can back them up in a corner and say, look, if you're not going to vote for this, it will pass with democratic votes, my hands are tied at this point, I ask the senate to act and give us something to work with. It's over here now. This is our option. We can either amend it, send it back with something better we like, or just pass it as is. So I think those 50 votes may be against it but with the democrats coming on board, it should not be a problem. 
>> John, thanks very much for your insight this morning. 
>> So let's break down now what's in some of this deal. What it means to you. We've been telling you about the so-called dairy cliff in addition to dealing with the fiscal crisis, the senate deal would extend federal farm policies through september which would mean milk prices will not double. The deal also knicksed a set pay raise for members of congress. The white house scored an agreement to raise tax rates on larger estates from 35% to 40% but republicans successfully insisted the exemption should be adjusted annually for inflation. There were some democrats who agreed with that, too. Farm state democrats, a provision that would increase the exemption amount to $7.5 million for individuals and $15 million for couples by 2020. Those households also would pay higher rates on investment profits with rates on dividends and capital gains rising from the 15% where it is right now to 20%. Now for taxpayers earning less than $450,000 a year, the deal would restore limits on personal exemptions and itemized deductions that existed back during the clinton administration with those benefits saving up for couples earning more than 250 grand a year, single people more than $200,000. The deal called for a permanent fix for the alternative minimum tax which would otherwise hit about 30 million taxpayers for the first time when filing their 2012 tax returns. And it would extend tax credits for college tuition and the working poor for five years. On the business side, some popular tax breaks would be extended through 2013 including a credit for research which benefits high tech companies and an investment write-off that helps manufacturers. The long-term unemployed, now a lot of people, millions of people have been watching this, they could count on receiving emergency benefits for another one year. Doctors, they will be spared a 27% in medicare reimbursements. That was set to take effect this month. Although the $30 billion cost of that extension will be covered by cutting other health care programs. An awful lot in here. All this depends on whether the house does it, too. So this is not all settled. That's what the senate version of this is. And here's the other thing, folks. Everyone, I want to be very clear here, your paycheck is going to be a little bit smaller. There's no question, because payroll tax holiday is done. That's going to be $10 to $40, depending on how much you make. You got to be aware you're going to have a little less money in your paycheck this year. 

[00:10:31]


>> And if you're lucky enough to make a lot of money over $450,000, your taxes are going up more than just this amount, because of things that were already in place, the medicare tax, and the affordable care act. 
>> That's right. 
>> On all people. I'm curious, guys, what you make of this deal in general? You guys come from the business world right now. What will be the response on the street? What's the response in board rooms, to this deal? 
>> This is a small, as puny as insignificant a deal as you could have made to avert the fiscal cliff. I think this just gives you that sense that so many people went into this last few days thinking that, why doesn't washington ever get ahead on this thing and do that comprehensive deal? Everybody would like the certainty of a real deal that addresses the deficit over the long-term and taxes and this is not that. 
>> But there is certainty in this ali. There is certainty. There's a lot of certainty in the issue of taxes. They're making permanent the bush tax cuts and you are setting that limit on high taxes. The alternative minimum tax which we talk about every year, it's a permanent fix. 
>> Yes. That certainty is great. That was the more political and interesting part of this discussion. The more complicated and difficult part of the discussion is what you do on spending and deficit. That's the part that they didn't take any responsibility on. So we're guaranteed between that and the debt limit discussion, that we'll be sitting here talking about this for another couple months. 
>> The stock market liked it. The dow closed up 166 points. It's not open today because of the holiday. The question is, is this a down payment on real deficit reduction, and a new budget negotiation, a new era of getting our budget house in order in washington? That's what wall street wants to see. It's been radio silence from CEOs BY THE WAY. I HAVE NOT HEARD FROM CEOs ON This yet. 
>> The good news for everyone, you can follow it all day, because it's not over yet. The house still has to vote on this. Stay with cnn, we will bring you the latest all morning, all day on this. In the meantime there is a lot of other news going on. We're learning more about secretary of state hillary clinton's health scare. Doctors say a routine mri revealed a blood clot in a blood vessel around her brain. They say mrs. Clinton did not suffer a stroke or any neurological damage as a result of this, and the secretary is expected to make a full recovery. Still, it doesn't -- it sounds scary, frankly. Jill dougherty is live at the state department right now. First of all, happy new year. 

[00:12:48]


>> Same to you, john. 
>> What else do we know about her condition? Because when you hear blood clot near the brain that does sound serious. 
>> Yeah, it does. When we first heard it, it did. When they refined the idea, i mean where it's located is not in the brain. And that would be very scary, because then you would have something perhaps like a stroke. But it's in that vein that goes between the skull and the brain. So it's kind of isolated from the brain, and what they're trying to do right now, is to shrink it. And the way they do that by giving blood thinners and that, indeed, is what she is doing in the hospital in new york right now. Getting these blood thinners. And you have to kind of, as the say, titrate it, figure out how much she needs, and that takes a little while. When they pin that down then they will be able to figure out her dosage and then eventually she will be released. But she won't until they figure that out. So it is a potentially pretty serious thing. But the good thing is, her doctors last night, in fact, saying she's talking with her doctors, talking with her family, completely engaged, and that she should make a full recovery. And that's the most important thing 
>> jill dougherty in washington. Chelsea clinton tweeted a short time ago thanking everyone for their well-wishes to the clinton family through this as mrs. Clinton does get better in the hospital. Thanks a lot, jill. Meanwhile amid stay the chaos arouhe fiscal cliff, the new year actually was ushered in last night. And in many places it happened in grand style. The crowd estimated at 1 million packed new york's times square, and they counted down to 2013. ???????????? 
>> 5, 4, 3, 2 -- happy new year! 
>> I can't believe I slept through that. And 2013 rolls into las vegas, a spectacular fireworks show lit up the night sky over the vegas strip. Check that out. That's pretty cool.

>>> Welcome back to "early start" everyone. Secretary of state hillary clinton spending new year's eve in a new york city hospital. Mrs. Clinton is being treated for a blood clot in her head. So we asked our chief medical correspondent dr. Sanjay gupta about her condition. 
>> We do have some of these details now about what precisely happened to secretary of state clinton, and the specific blood clot. The blood clot that we're talking about now was unclear where it was located previously. But we now know it's in one of the blood vessels around the brain. It is not, again, on the brain. Pushing on the brain in any way. But it is a blood vessel that actually drains blood away from the brain. It's called a cerebral vein. We know that in secretary clinton's case it is on the right side of her head somewhere this area. It's called the right transverse side. Let me show you the left side just for sake of demonstration here. If I remove the hemisphere of the brain here, you can actually see where the veins are, you see that blue area right there, that is the area that is actually draining blood away from the brain, and one of these veins in this area, that's where that clot actually has occurred. Most likely due to a combination of the head trauma that she had a few weeks ago, in addition to the fact that she has had a problem with blood clots in the past dating back to 1998. We hear from her doctors. They say she's on blood thinners, she is awake, she is talking, and most importantly there's no evidence of stroke or neurological damage. My guess is they're going to continue to monitor her at least for another couple days in the hospital and probably get another scan at some point to make sure that clot is, in fact, dissolved as a result of those blood thinner medications. As we get more details we'll bring them to you. Back to you. 
>> And of course we cannot repeat this enough. Mrs. Clinton's doctors expect her to make a full recovery. 
>> All right. Coming up the senate agrees to a fiscal cliff deal. But is the crisis really averted? What it really means for the average person in your paycheck. used Miles To come home for the holidays. That's double miles you can actually use...

[00:24:00]


>>> Minding your business this morning. Markets are closed today! I can tell you with great certainty what about happen in stocks. Nothing. Everyone's waiting to see what the fiscal cliff will do to your 401(k) IN THE EARLY PART OF THE New year. Markets in asia mixed. U.S. Stock markets, by the way, finished 2012 on a very high note. The dow gained more than 1% to finish the year above the 13,000 mark. The senate's progress yesterday, something that stock market investors certainly like to see. But the fiscal cliff is only the beginning of the fiscal drama. Oh, yes. There are three, count them, three more cliff-like deadlines over the next three months. First the debt ceiling. Yesterday the treasury secretary made it official, federal borrowing has reached the $16.4 trillion debt ceiling. They can't issue more debt. Right? Without raising that debt ceiling. Congress has to do it. We have about two months of head room, which means the deadline to tackle that would be late february or early march. Next up the sequester. A series of automatic 8% to 10% cuts in many federal agencies. The senate's fiscal cliff deal would kick that can down about two months to march. A lot of federal agencies trying to figure out what's that going to mean down the road? And then there's the continuing budget resolution which uses short-term band aids. The current resolution expires towards the end of march. So, before you think that we've averted any kind of fiscal cliff, we're actually hanging off of it by our fingernails waiting for the house to fix it and you've got all these other deadlines. 
>> It's no joke. We have gone to the brink on each one of those three things. 
>> That's the way we do it now. We wait until the absolute last minute to get things done. 
>> Let me give you the glass half full here. We are in -- 
>> half full of champagne. 
>> We're in an environment of risk, we're not making it worse type environment. We're doing things to embrace the deficit and the debt. Slowly but we're doing it. 
>> The problem not having a budget really is fundamentally a problem. The government does all sorts of things, passes all sorts of resolutions whether you like this country or don't like that one, but the basic constitutional responsibility of the government is actually to have a budget. And a budget is the manifestation of your priorities generally speaking. That's the one thing that would just be great if we actually did. 

[00:26:08]


>> Here we are where we're trying to sit down with our budgets and figure out what our priorities for the year, how are we going to live a little bit below our means so we can grow wealth and our government can't figure out a budget. 
>> I'd like it if they did that. 
>> My advice is deal with your own financials. 
>> Good luck with that. One down, one to go. Will the house go along with the fiscal cliff deal hammered out by the white house and the senate earlier this morning? We're going to have a live report from washington just ahead. 
>> You can watch us any time on your desk top or mobile phone. Go to cnn.Com/tv. mommy having. Mommy's having a french fry. Yes she is, yes she is.

>>> While you were sleeping, no rest for lawmakers. Not that they deserve any. As early morning deal is reached in the senate on the fiscal cliff. Plus, the u.S. Still poised to go over the edge. I don't know why we keep saying while you were sleeping. Do we think anybody was sleeping? 20 is officially rung in as of now we have no word on what the house of representatives will do. But as we wait, we'll walk you through the bill's details and tell you the impact that it has on you. 
>> And secretary of state hillary clinton waking up this morning in a new york city hospital. Doctors say she's making excellent progress. We're going to have the very latest on the secretary of state's condition. 
>>> Welcome back to "early start" I'm ali velshi. 
>> Christine romans. 
>> And I'm john berman. We're having a great time here. There's no better way to be over the fiscal cliff than sitting here with you guys. So thank you this morning. So, after kicking off the new year by falling off the fiscal cliff, or at least going over it, the senate has now acted and now it's up to the house to deliver all of us a soft landing this morning. If they can. Just after 2:00 eastern this morning the senate overwhelmingly passed the plan that was crafted by the vice president and the senate minority leader. The vote, very big, 89-8. The republican-controlled house left well before midnight last night, so they will have to take up the measure later this morning. Here's how the two senate leaders summed up their night. 
>> I'm disappointed that we weren't able to make the grand bargain as we tried to do for so long. But we tried. 
>> So it took an imperfect solution to prevent our constituents from a very real financial pain. But in my view, it was worth the effort. 
>> So here's what the senate plan means for you. Bush-era tax cuts extended for people earning less than $400,000 a year. And couples earning less than $450,000. Unemployment benefits extended for a year for 2 million americans. And a permanent adjustment for inflation to that alternative minimum tax. Now if you're wondering about spending cuts, lawmakers are punting. They'll fight about those over the next couple of months. Can't wait for more drama from d.C. 

[00:32:32]


>> It's not nothing but ali says it's puny. Still, brianna keilar joins us live now from washington this morning, up all night like the rest of us. We have any idea what happens next, brianna? 
>> Well, the house is obviously in the court of the house they could vote on this as soon as today. In fact they could vote on this on the early side today, midday. But it's still to be seen. Because house speaker john boehner needs to take this deal, and he needs to go before his conference, and he needs to say, hey guys, what do you think about this? So he'll have to go through this process of trying to sl this to his conference. The thing is, since mitch McCONNELL, THE TOP REPUBLICAN IN The senate, negotiated this, presumably he did so with some buy-in from the speaker, and also this passed so overwhelmingly that the thought is, this will get some -- obviously some republican support. How much still to be determined, in the house. Of course president obama wants the house to take this up right away. He says while neither democrats nor republicans got everything they wanted this agreement is the right thing to do for our country and the house should pass it without delay. This does, though, john, come down to rank and file republicans. They've proven the hardest to please here. And so they may not just take up the bill. They could amend the bill, change it more to their liking, and send it back to the senate. That's one possibility. And we don't know exactly which direction house republicans are going to choose. But the bottom line is, is house speaker john boehner who determines what goes to the house floor. 
>> And of course the last time he went to his caucus and said hey, guys, it didn't work out so well for him. But this is different, brianna, largely because he doesn't need every one of his republin votes on this. They need to cobble together a group of republicans and a group of democrats to get this passed, correct? 
>> That's right. And this is different for a couple of reasons. One being what you just said, that he can pass this with some democratic support, and we saw that, obviously, happen in the senate. But the other reason this is different is because we're already over the cliff. Technically speaking, all of these taxes have already gone up, right? So right now, you would have house republicans voting for tax cuts, not for tax hikes, and that is much, much more palatable for them, john. 

[00:34:48]


>> Brianna keilar in washington. Great to see you. ??> frustrating exercise for everybody. We gave some of you the chance to vent about the fiscal cliff. And you had some strong opinions. 
>> My feeling is that it's a shame that we've elected these officials and they can't do their job, and they blame each other, or the other side, when it's the american people that are suffering. 
>> We may have to look at the income diversity of congressmen and congresswomen, like vast majority of them are millionaires plus. So we really have to think about who is representing us in politics and how do we make our representatives more reflective and more diverse of the american people. 
>> All right. The story is still developing. As we get new information, which actually christine has some of, we're going to bring it to you through the morning. Christine, what's this morning information you have 
>> he's making fun of me. Well the irs has issued new guidelines for withholding tables going back to the 2001 -- 
>> you're one of these people who wants to get your tax return for 2012 started now. 
>> I would recommend you wait. I would recommend you wait. But it shows you that the irs, the treasury is preparing -- 
>> I know this because of many, many years of working with you. 
>> No. I'm like your younger sister. 
>> We'll bring you news like this all morning, ladies and gentlemen. Stay with us. Don't go anywhere, because it is new year's day. 
>> Happy new year. 
>> In case you missed it, here's the countdown as 2013 arrived in new york's times square about 5 1/2 hours ago. ???????????? 
>> people making out in times square right there. Happy new year everyone. 1 million people packed the square to welcome in the new year. As I said, happy new year, guys. From toshiba and all of us here at cnn. We know that secretary of state hillary clinton, of course, something treated for a blood clot in hear head. This news has hit all of us the last few days. Clinton doctors say a routine mri revealed a clot in a vein between the brain and skull behind her right ear. They say there's no evidence of a stroke or any kind of neurological damage. Secretary clinton is being treated with blood thinners to help dissolve the clot. She is expected to make a full recovery. 

[00:36:59]


>> All right. 
>> Scary stuff. 
>> I know. I know. Really is. And wish her the best and her family, too, on this new year. In the fiscal cliff crisis, lots of finger pointing. Lots of metaphors and analogies. 517 days of it to be exact. House speaker john boehner feeling a lot of the heat. We'll talk with the spokesperson for a conservative group that suggests that he resign because of his failed plan "b." Pchases, plus a 50% annual bonus. And everyone...But her likes 50% more cash.

[00:41:01]


>>> All right. We're playing the waiting game right now here, waiting to see if the fiscal cliff deal worked out between vice president joe biden and senate republicans can pass in the house of representatives. Later today. Late last night, really early this morning, the republican leadership in the house released this statement. 9 house will honor its commitment to consider the senate agreement if it's passed. Decisions about whether the house will seek to accept or promptly amend the measure will not be made until house members, and the american people, have been able to review the legislation. All right, ron myer is a spokesman for the conservative group american majority action. His group suggested speaker boehner resign for proposing his plan "b." That was awhile ago right now. He joins us now this morning. Ron, I should say, we've had you on the show a number of times. One of the last times we had you on you correctly predicted very early that plan "b" was not going to pass in the house. That was the measure that speaker boehner proposed a few weeks ago. So I want to ask you today, as we're heading into the crucial fiscal cliff vote in the house, do you think what the senate just passed will pass the house? 
>> Well, it could pass the house. But he definitely doesn't have the majority of the gop caucus right now. As of last night he didn't have anywhere close to a majority of the caucus in support of this plan.He was having a hard time getting his own leadership behind this, much less majority of the caucus. So I would say there's at least 100 republicans who will vote against this if they bring it up as proposed by the senate. THE BIDEN/McCONNELL PLAN, THINK About it this way, it's a 41-1 ratio as far as balance goes. It's $620 billion in tax hikes, ly $15 billion in cuts. In fact, it's actually less cuts than the status quo right now. So for republicans it's extremely not palatable for people who ally care about saving my generation from a huge amount of debt. This plan is a complete joke. 
>> Let's stick to the policies for a second. 
>> Yeah. 
>> On the politics of it, it seems to me what you're saying is even though it may not get a majority of republicans in the house vote you think this measure's going to get through today. 

[00:43:03]


>> It could very well get through today. I think if you want to hear on the liberal side is they don't have a ton of support because progressives are extremely dissatisfied with this plan as well. They think that people under $250,000 who make more than that are evil people and should be taxed to oblivion so they'd like to see huge amount of tax hikes. 
>> One last political question again, before my business colleagues jump on you. 
>> Sure. 
>> On the politics side of this, you went after speaker boehner for proposing plan "b." WHAT ABOUT mitch McConnell right now? HE SHEPrdED THROH THIS DEAL With the white house. Where does your group stand on him and his leadership in the senate, and his next election, which is really less than two years from now 
>> obviously we're not a big fan of what he just did with the president -- with vice president biden. The plan, like I said, isn't balanced at all. President obama is insisting on a balanced approach. It's 41-1. AND for McConnell to go along with it and to whip the rest -- a lot of his colleagues along with him in the senate is pretty sad, to be honest. But as far as political repercussions, I think considering it happened, what, when people are still celebrating the new year, i think we're going to wait and see whether or not we're going TO TRY TO ACT against McConnell. I think that they obviously have been forced into this situation by president obama, and by actually -- I mean literally these people are celebrating new year's in their offices. And then they're forced to come on to the floor and vote for something. Of course, I think there's a little bit more negotiating room that you have when you use that kind of leverage and force it to the last minute like this. 
>> Ron, it's ali velshi. Good morning, happy new year to you. One of the things that grover norquist has been putting forward and a number of conservatives have. 
>> Io happy you brought him up. 
>> Can't get really a few hours in without talking about grover norquist on these things. One of the things you brought up, is the tax matter which is the most political but not the most complicated part of this thing, just the most political for reasons you stated. You then can move on to the next stage of this, which is really a smart, sophisticated, effective discussion on entitlement reform, on spending reform. Do you buy that argument? Maybe this is a bit of a success. You put the tax stuff on the back burner now, we've agreed to it and we move on and we start talking about spending and deficit reduction. 

[00:45:08]


>> I mean, it is going to be the exact same debate. President obama outlined that yesterday. These tax hikes are not enough for him. That he's going to go after more tax hikes. It's going to be the same discussion. The fact is we're just ceding more and more ground and more and more jobs, by the way, that young people need. So that's one of the things where I think house republicans get it, where at least I mean the majority of our caucus gets it where we're going to stand up against this plan because it's bad for young people, bad for our future, it's bad for the rest of america too. There was a great article in "the washington times" yesterday about why this plan and why plans like this are going to absolutely hurt and bankrupt our generation. I think there's at least a core group of republicans who are actually going to defend that and try to get a real solution done. Something that addresses entitlement reform, that doesn't just tax people. This is a tax bill. This just raises taxes. And that's all it's doing. And the fact of the matter is grover norquist, this just shows how little power grover has. Grover is a friend and I like him. However remember with plan "b." He endorsed plan "b" and we shot it down. We had more than 50 republicans against that bill. Grover norquist's power is really -- I mean it's just washington created. It's media created. 
>> You think it's over for grover? 
>> I'm not saying it's over for grover. He has a great pledge. He does great work. But to say that he's some sort of like magician behind the curtain is absolute fallacy. 
>> All right ron meyer, thanks for joining us this thorng. Happy new year. 
>> You, too. 
>> Some republicans we hear that the president has not been leading, he's been awol, where's the democratic leadership? He said president forced them into it and they were all celebrating in their offices last night. 
>> Ron meyer sounds like a guy who actually got a lot of sleep last night. 
>> All right coming up on "early start," finally, closure, in the infamous case of pardon for civil rights activists 40 years in the making. You can watch us any time on your desk top or mobile phone.

We're officially over the fiscal cliff but it may wind up being more of a slow tumble than a plunge because earlier this morning the senate overwhelmingly passed a plan that keeps the bush-era tax cuts in place for individuals earning less than $400,000 a year and couples earning less than $450,000. The house picks up the measure later this morning. Civil rights activist known as the wilmington 10 have been pardoned by north carolina's outgoing governor. Nine african-american men and one woman were convicted of firebombing a grocery store in 1972. Their convictions were overturned, but now finally a pardon. Governor purdue saying their convictions were tainted by naked racism. 
>>> The 124th tournament of roses parade in pasadena will take on a different look today. For the first time ever, the defense department has a float. This will be a replica of the korean war veteran's memorial in washington, d.C. Also, the occupy movement plans to have a float following the parade, featuring 15 foot high mr. Monopoly character to represent greedy bankers. I would like the shoe with the thimble more than the monopoly guy. Other news, cnn's chief medical correspondent dr. Sanjay gupta kicked off 2013 by taking part in the annual new year's eve midnight run in new york's central park. He was joined by other time warner employees, and friends. 
>> Ali was there -- no, he wasn't. 
>> Dr. Gupta also led the time warner fit nation team in 2012 promoting the importance of physical fitness, and it is important. 
>> That's just nuts. He was talking about it yesterday morning here with us. I thought it was like the polar bear thing. I thought he had to run naked or something. I didn't realize he could wear his clothes. That takes a lot of the edge off the whole thing. 
>> There's really nowhere to go after that. I'll just say this. It is a new year so let's see what the weather holds today. Karen maginnis is at cnn weather center in florida. Good morning, karen. Help us out here. 
>> Good morning, guys. Well, we've got some very unsettled weather to tell you about from the mid-atlantic down towards texas with texas looking at pretty strong thunderstorms. Right now it's houston, up at college station, thunderstorms rumbling around there, also into arkansas. But in portions of oklahoma and kansas, the roads have become very icy. Very treacherous driving conditions expected there. The tennessee valley and then toward the mid-atlantic, the rainfall, a little bit less than it has been. But across west virginia, it's primarily snowfall. Now, the bitterly cold air is still entrenched across the upper mississippi river valley. Grand forks, the windchill factor feels like it's 26 degrees below zoir. Yesterday, they had a high temperature of 1. Well, the current temperature right now in fargo is minus 8. North platte is 12. As I mentioned, slippery road conditions throughout portions of kansas and southwestern oklahoma. And if you're just getting up, be aware of that situation. And yesterday, computer models will fairly accurate. Predicting between 3 and 6 inches of snow, salina, kansas, saw just over 5 inches. And to all of you in new york, happy new year. To everyone else, happy new year. It is a marathon, isn't it? Not a sprint. Right? 

[00:54:03]


>> That's right. We're only in the first minutes of that marathon. We've got a long way to go. Happy new year. 
>> Thanks. 
>> All right. Other news. What did she do this year? So in case you missed any of the wackiness, the best of kathy and anderson in times square. That's up next. 

[00:56:30]


>>> All right. Live from new york, it's new year's eve with anderson cooper and kathy griffin. They rang in the new year again here on cnn. As usual it was anything goes. So check out some of the laughs. 
>> Rihanna will be here -- 
>> someone on twitter was saying every time I giggle nervously. 
>> Calvin harris -- 
>> who is calvin harris? 
>> Okay. You know what? Let me take this part. Name mitt romney's son. 
>> Tag, josh, ben, matt. 
>> Yes. 
>> Craig? 
>> Yes. 
>> Oh! 
>> You did it. 
>> Do we have the election night photo? 
>> There's a photo that kathy sent me on election night and told me to show id to david gergen in the midst of our election coverage. 
>> I love gary tuchman. Obviously you are angry with him. To send him, some sort of town in maine where he drops a minnow in a bucket. Ryan, screw you! We do better broadcasting. 
>> I was once doing a live shot with paula zahn and I was in sri lanka and a dog humped my leg. I started giggling. Finally I was like, paula, I've just got to tell you, there's a dog humping my leg. 
>> How's it going, nice to see you? 
>> I almost wore this. I was this close to wearing that. 
>> What was that? 
>> That was -- 
>> really? 
>> Yes. ?????? I got you babe I got you babe ?????? 
>> I starting sexting george stephanopoulos. 
>> Really? 
>> No. 
>> Marissa says for a new year's present can anderson get a word in edgewise every once in awhile. 
>> You're like ike turner. It was so fantastic, she had on the joan collins wig. Oh, my god it was heaven on a stick. 

[00:58:32]


>> You hardly talk to me anymore. 
>> When you come through the door. At the end of the day. 
>> We'll check in with gary tuchman. And we wish you a very happy new year of m success, and peace, and happiness, and love. 
>> That's right. Happy new year, everyone. "Early start" continues right now. 
>> The bill as amended is passed. 
>> No rest for lawmakers as a late night deal is reached in the senate on the fiscal cliff. But the u.S. Still poised to go over the cliff. 
>>> But even as the country rang in the new year the deadline for that deal was passing. What happens next for lawmakers? And what impact is it going to have on your wallet? 
>> Also we're learning new details about secretary of state hillary clinton's blood clot in her head. We'll have the latest on her treatment. And her prognosis. 
>>> Happy new year. 
>> Happy new year. 
>> Good morning, welcome to "early start" everyone. I'm john berman. 
>> I'm ali velshi. 
>> And I'm christine romans. Zoraida is off today. It is 6:00 a.M. Right now on the nose. Well 20 seconds away. 
>> And breaking news. Can you feel it? We're actually over the fiscal cliff. So, now it's up to the republican-controlled house to pull us back. Here's what happened while you were sleeping, or sleeping or doing something else. A deal crafted by vice president joe biden and minority leader mitch McConnell passed the nate by a margin of 89-8. That vote wrapped up after 2:00 a.M. Eastern time. The house takes up this plan later on this morning. No telling on how that will turn out if the house approves, the deal will estimate a generated $600 billion over the next ten years this is how senate leaders of both sides of the aisle are assessing the measure. 
>> I have said all along, the most important priority is protecting middle class families. 

[01:00:32]


>> Thihouldn't be the model for how we do things. But we can say we've done some good for the country. 
>> Bush era tax cuts will remain in place for individuals earning less than 400,000, couples earning less than 450,000. Unemployment benefits for 2 million americans would be extended for a year. The alteive minimum tax permanently adjusted for inflation. And when it comes to spending cuts, lawmakers decided to kick that can down the road for two more months. We can expect more finger pointing and fighting to start the new year. Brianna keel ar, with us all morning joins us again live from washington. And really, the house is a wild card. We don't know exactly how they will vote later today. But they will take this up somehow. How will this play out? 
>> They could vote today. They could vote on the early side today, say midday. That's entirely possible, but, first, house speaker john boehner has to take this deal that was struck in the senate and he will meet with his conference with house republicans and he'll try to get some buy in. Explain it to them, have an exchange of ideas and see where they are. You know some of the rank and file house republicans have not been easy to please in this process. So the president, of course, wants this to move through the house quickly. He said neither democrats nor republicans got everything they wanted this agreement is the right thing to do for our country and the house should pass it without the play. If the speaker goes before the conference, perhaps they will try to change it to be more to their liking. Amend it, send it back to the senate. And that would sort of prolong the process of going back and forth. And also yes, you mentioned the spending cuts being deferred, but only for two months, john. Two months. That means we'll be hanging out a lot talking about some of the stuff we've been talking about now you for months, as it is. 

[01:02:41]


>> That's right this is just the beginning. We've been talking a lot about the republican conference and whether speaker boehner can get the votes he needs or any votes at all. What's going on on the democratic side? Nancy pelosi had her democratic grip. She won't get unanimous support, will she? 
>> That's to be seen. It's very possible there will be a number of democrats who are not happy with this and there may be some who do not vote for it on the left. That's entirely possible. But nancy pelosi is on a phone call with president obama and harry reid and she signed off on this, so she has a pretty good sense of where her caucus is, will be getting a lot of democratic support. When you look at how much democratic support this got in the senate, that's an indication it would get a lot in the house. The thing is, speaker boehner gets to determine if this bill -- I think the fact is, if you put this bill on the house floor, it will go through very easily. It's up to him whether he wants to put it on the floor or change it to g more republican support. 
>> Brianna keilar, a big day ahead of us. Thank you very much. 
>> Let's go to capitol hill, jonathan allen, a senior correspondent for politico. Happy new year. I want to pick up where brianna left off. John boehner has a choice here, corral support from the republicans or put it to an up-or-down vote. The distance is allowing super groups to put pressure on congressmen to say we don't like this deal. People on the left don't like the deal, say it gives away too much. People on the right don't like it, it raises taxes. What's your sense of the best play here? 
>> I think what we've heard from speaker bainer and his allies in the republican leadership, this is a binary question for the republican congress. Either pass this bill the way it is or amend it to a way that is more likely for house republicans. The option he has not put on the table is go home and leave it be. What you will see in the next 24, 48 -- well, we don't have 72 hours anymore in this congress. What you will see in the next hours is getting through, getting done and getting the president's desk. Whether it remains in the current form or not, the question we will have answered tonight. 

[01:05:15]


>> What is the collar damage if it gets done? Does it matter? Does john boehner come out of this weakened or strengthened? 
>> John boehner's weakness and strength are kind of the same thing. He tends to take a laissez faire approach with his guys, doesn't kick them in the side very often. Not able to do that. That makes him popular, means people like him, but it's hard for him to command his troops. I don't think he comes out of this any worse off than before in terms of members of his caucus, they look at him as having created a strategy that is narrowly navigating all the sholes. 
>> The result of the deal, we will have to have two or three more deals in the coming months and go through the cliff like negotiations. What is the takeaway and lesson for the republican conference. They keep bainary long and try to get better deals? Or get forced to the up or down votesory the course of the coming months? 
>> They are looking for leverage. Their favorite word. Where do they have lev rage over the president to get spending cuts? They keep seeking leverage long past the point where it's obvious the president has leverage over them. I think over the next couple of months, with the next debt ceiling increase, with the delay in the sequester, automatic spending cuts coming in march, with those two things, you will see republicans try to force the president's hand. Honestly, we see a big kick of the can down the road. A couple more months, talked both the congressional leaders and the president about a deficit reduction deal last night. They added 4 trillion in debt over the next ten years. If they hadn't acted, you might see deficit reduction, but not in a way a lot of taxpayers would like. It will be interesting to see what happens in the coming months. A lot of talk about entitlement reform, about making the tax code a little different than it is now. So I think we'll have to see that in the coming year. 

[01:07:27]


>> Astute observations, we'll watch it closely. I appreciate it. Kristina the kick the can tringing game is not over. We'll have to say that many, many times over the next two months. 
>> I want to bring down some of the deal for you, reset the stage. We'll telling you about the dairy cliff. In addition to dealing with the fiscal cliff, it would extend federal farm policies through september, which means milk prices won't double and it nixes a set pay raise for members of congress. The white house scored an agreement to raise taxes on larger estates from 35% to 40%, but republicans said it should be adjusted annually for inflation, it would go 7.5% for individuals, and they would pay higher tax rates on investment profits and capital gains rising to 20%, and less than 450,000, the deal would restore limits on personal exemptions that existed during the clinton administration and phasing out for those making more than $250,000 and single people making more than $200,000. The deal calls for a permanent phoenix for the permanent minimum tax. Yes, I said permanent. It would hit taxpayers when filing for 2012. Something they patch every year. It would extend tax credits for the working poor and students for the next year. Accountants working, trying to find out in high tax places like california, in new york, in illinois, in new jersey, you know what this will mean during tax season. 
>> A lot of peoplepening up the books saying holy cow. We have to re-establish the rules. Let me ask you this. What is the difference between 250,000 and $400,000? The president is taking some heat from the left, from liberals saying he caved on that number. Is that an important number economically? 

[01:09:40]


>> Now the white house and the senate have twined rich in america and rich is $400,000. 
>> So 370 is the top 1%. And the difference in revenue, $650 billion over ten years versus $800 billion and change. It's not highly significant, more symbolic. The republicans are right about the fact you cannot deal with the debt issue by raising taxes on the rich. So there are a lot of conservatives is that say it must be focused on real debt reduction. 
>> Three more chances to have this discussion -- is a nice way to put it, or fight is a more realistic way to put it. Stay with cnn. There is a lot happening today. Will the house vote on it? When will they vote on it? How will they vote on it? Stay with us. Other news today. 
>>> A routine mri, anything but routine for secretary of state hillary clinton. It revealed a blood clot in the vain that drains blood from the head. Likely the result of a fall earlier this month when mrs. Clinton suffered a concussion. There is no evidence of a stroke or any kind of neurological damage and the secretary is expected to make a complete recovery. Still very scary when you hear what happened. Jill dougherty is live at the state department. What do we know about her condition right now? 
>> She is stable, in the hospital. And the main thing right now, they are trying to shrink that blood clot by administering medications, blood thinners and that's their task right now, to get exactly how much she needs over what period. They have to work on that because it depends on body weight and everything. When they have that pinned down, then oretically at that point they will be able to release her. It did sown very scary and potentially it is serious. But they seem to have it your honor control. Luckily, it's not bleeding inside the brain and that's the important thing. She's stable, talking with her doctors, talking with the family, in fact, there was a recent tweet as you just mentioned last hour, a tweet from chelsea clinton, thanking people from sending their best wishes to her mother so the prognosis is that she would be, you know, released when they get this -- when she is stable and she know how much medication she will need. 

[01:12:05]


>> Jill dougherty in washington, thank you very much. 
>>> Meanwhile sshgt new year, 2013, arriving in fwrand style around the country? A few hours ago. Here in new york, crowd estimated at 1 million people packed times square and counted down the new year. 
>> Five, four, three, two, one. 
>> And in atlanta, 2013 was greeted with the dropping of a giant georgia peach, because that's how they do things down there. Back in new york, an army of sanitation workers descended on times square after all of the new year's eve revelers left and they will begin the monumental task of cleaning up. 
>> Coming up, the senate may have reached a deal on the senate cliff. The big question, will the house play along? We'll speak with democratic congressman jason alfire when we come back. People are always asking me how we make these GEICO adverts. So we're taking you behind the scenes. This coffee cup, for example, is computer animated. It's not real. GEICO's customer satisfaction is quite real though. This computer-animated coffee tastes dreadful. GEICO. 15 minutes could save you 15 % or more on car insurance. Someone get me a latte will ya please? cleaner, we replaced people with a machine. What? Customers didn't like it. So why do banks do it? Hello? Hello?! If your bank doesn't let you talk to a real person 24/7, you need an ally. Hello? Ally bank. Your money needs an ally. 

[01:15:51]


>>> All right. This morning, all eyes on the house of representatives. While you were sleeping or doing something else, the senate voted on a plan to avert the fiscal cliff. Now the question as we kick off 2013 is this. Will the house of representatives follow along? Jason altmeier a blue dog democrat from pennsylvania. He is one of the most independent voters in the house and retires at the end of the session. So we are getting him in his waning minutes on capitol hill. Thank you for joining us, talking with us right now. Happy new year. 
>> Happy new year. Glad to be here. 
>> How are you going to vote, sir? 
>> I'm going to vote for it. I think you will get most all democratic votes on the house. If they allow it to come to the floor. I think half the republicans, maybe slightly more. This will pass if they allow it to come up to a vote. 
>> That's some confidence, some certainty and confidence, sir. 
>> Start the new year out strong. Wr we have had a death of that for a long time. An op-ed this morning in "the washington post" entitled obama's failed leadership. "The main reason we keep having these destructive and inconcludive budget confrontations is not simple that will many republicans have been intrancei gent on taxes, the larger cause is that obama refuses to concede that social security, medicare, medicaid are driving future spending and deficits. So when republicans make concessions on taxes they get little in return." Are you set up for more confrontation. 
>> I think we are set up for more confrontation. ON SEPTEMBER 30th, WHEN THE Clock strikes, we'll be in the same position. The president has made concessions, put on the table reforms to the entitlement program. Last year, we were close to a grand bargain. 4 trillion deficit reduction that would include major entitlement reforms. The president has done what he needs to do that's unfair criticism. 

[01:18:07]


>> What is lacking, congressman? What is the problem? It is a popular con serb tuf and 
-- conservative reefrain. Where is the impasse in terms of being able to say here are what our priorities are as a party. 
>> The reason there hasn't been a budget since 2009 because of the filibuster rule in the house. The house under both democratic and an leadership has been able to pass things. We haven't had the ability to come together. This wasn't necessarily the time to have this discussion facing the fiscal deadline. The budget season is coming up, there will be some serious effort to reform entitlements, reduce the deficit and bring down spending in months and years ahead. 
>> John berman here again this is your final day or two in the house. You are freer to give some of your analysis right here. What do you make of president obama, the negotiator? There has been a lot of cricism from the left, frankly, that he gave too much to republicans as this part of the deal. He's showing them when his back is up against the wall, he will gave. 250,000 was his limit all along, what is he like as a negotiator? Your thoughts? 
>> I don't think that is a fair criticism. There this is give and take, there are some on the left for who any give at all is a failed negotiation. The president is politically the big winner here. He got what he wanted with the tax cuts. He got what he wanted with the estate tax and other issues and the sequester delay. So I just think that the president working with senator McCONNELL, WHO DID A VERY GOOD Job with his conference in the senate, that they all look good. We have to see if we can do our job in the house. That's still to come today. 

[01:20:14]


>> Congressman, thank you very much. Happy new year and good luck going forward. 
>> I appreciate it. Thank you. 
>>> Coming up, the senate agrees to the fiscal cliff deal, but is the crisis really averted? What does this mean for you and your paycheck? We'll tell you, when we come back.

>>> Happy new year. Minding your business this morning. Markets are closed today. How will the fiscal cliff affect YOUR 401(k) IN THE EARLY PART OF The new year? U.S. Markets finished on a high note. The dow finished the year above 13,000. A good year for stocks. The fiscal cliff, only the beginning of the drama. Three more deadlines over the next three months. Federal barrowing has reached the 16.4 trillion debt ceiling. We have two months of head room if they move some stuff around in accounts, the deadline to tackle that is late february, early march. Next up, the sequester, a series of automatic cuts in many agencies, they kick the can about two months to march. And then there is the continuing budget resolution which enacts a budget using short-term band aids. It continues to the end of march. Liberal senators oppose giving high-income households a pass on tax increase. Lawmakers have a grace period to avoid the bulk of tax increases and budget cuts without causing too much damage, that's, of course, assuming the markets don't completely freak out. 
>> The thing is, we should remind everyone, we actually are over the cliff. We have begun after that deadline, but nothing actually happens yet. 
>> But it does help this is not a working day. No federal offices, nobody to change any legislation or do anything. As long as the house gets this done. House back at noon today, eastern time? There is no guarantee the house comes in, gets this done. There could be fighting, amendments, a changed bill. Some talk they will amount it, send and back are. We're not done. 
>> The markets are telling us they think it will get done. If it doesn't, there is a glitch, markets are respond. 

[01:25:57]


>> I want to talk about happy new year and the [ay christine romans says happy new year, u.S. Like are you trying to convince us. Really, happy new year. 
>> Happy new year. 
>> It is happy. 
>> The problem with us, we weren't sharing the new year's revelry with much of the nation. 
>> I will forever be angry with the 112th congress of deprize offing me of one of my new year's. 
>> They took away their new year's eve, once they did that, they caved on a deal. 
>> The senate knocks an early morning deal. They celebrated at the senate. The house will reconvene later. Can they pass the same deal that passed at 2:00 a.M.? We will speak with phil gingrley. If you are leaving the house right now, have you a tough day ahead of us, watch us on your desk top, mobile phone. Go to cnn.Com/mobiletv. Not leaving your house, wake up, watch us. I tuned it all out. With UnitedHealthcare, I get information that matters... My individual health profile. Not random statistics. They even reward me for addressing my health risks. So I'm doing fine... but shs still going to give me a heart attack. We're more than 78,000 people looking out for more than 70 million Americans. That's health in numbers. UnitedHealthcare. dream? I'm having one right now. I don't want to be disturbed. And I won't. Because before I went to sleep, I set this. Now my iphone knows not to ring, unless it's important. 'Cause disturbing this would just be .. wrong. 9??s# ??q 

[01:30:12]


>>> No rest for lawmakers. An early morning deal reached on the fiscal cliff. The u.S. Still poised to go over that cliff. 
>> And as it is sun rises on 2013, we are still waiting for the house to act. That, by the way is not congress. We'll walk you through the bill's details and tell you the impact it will have on you. 
>>> All right. Members of congress never that pretty. 
>>> Secretary of state clinton waking up in a new york city hospital. Making excellent progress. We'll have the latest on her condition. 
>> Welcome to "early start." I am ali velshi. 
>> I am christine romans. 
>> And quite a lot to talk about. Through this morning, the senate passed a plan to fend off the fiscal cliff. But now it's up to the house of representatives to follow suit. Just after 2:00 eastern time this morning, the senate overwhelmingly passed a plan that was crafted by the vice president and the senate minority leader, mitch McCONNELL. Vote? 89-8. The republican controlled house left well before midnight last night, so they will are to take up the measure today. 
>> I said all along, the most important priority was to protect middle class families. This legislation does that. 
>> Thihouldn't be the model for how we do things around here, but I think we've done some good for the country. 
>> Bush era tax cuts extend for individuals earning less than 400,000 a year, and couples earning less than 450,000. Ha means if you make more than that, your taxes going up. Unemployment benefits extended for a year for 2 million americans and a permanent adjustment to the alternative minimum tax. A big deal for a lot of people. Wondering about spending cuts? They will fight the battles over the next two months. Joined now by brianna ilar. Before we get to more, where does this go today? 

[01:32:25]


>> It say big day. We're not completely out of the woods, but I think we should feel pretty good about where we are. I will say that. It seems like obviously a lot of progress made. The house is next, and the next step for speaker john boehner to take this deal brokered in the senate, passed by a large margin. A huge vote, 89-8, doesn't happen every day in the gnat and talk to his conference of republicans and see what they think about it. Obviously, there will be issues with some of his rank and file you would think, they have been hard to please throughout this process as we tried to work on deficit reduction plan with president obama, but then the speaker will decide if he's going to take up this bill as is, or if enough republicans want to change it, amend it, send it back no the senate. The expectation all along through the fiscal cliff negotiations, whatever would pass the house would do so with democratic and republican support. Ultimately up to the speaker whether he wants to put it on the floor. 
>> And the house reconvenes at noon eastern time. A lot going on. Watching that all day. Thank you very much. 
>>> Let's talk to someone who if the house takes it up, will vote on a fiscal cliff deal previously said he was against letting any bush era tax cuts expire. Good morning, sir. Happy new year. If you get this bill today, are you going to vote for it? 
>> Well, thank you, glad to be on "early start" this morning. I've got to see, just as the speak every said, we have to read the bill. We have to know what's in the 157 pages and look at it carefully. The speaker will put it on the floor if there is enough republican support for it, but not ready to accept it lock, stock, and barrel. It could be amended, sent back to the senate. It's a little early to commit how I feel about it you mentioned I'm against raising taxes on anybody. And I absolutely am. I think that the people in the 11th district of georgia, northwest georgia, my congressional district, feel very strongly about that, I want to do what's best for them and what's best for the nation. I'll look at this very carefully.

>> You will all look at it very carefully. You talk about taxes, the president moved from 250,000 to $400,000. And compromise on the estate tax. A republican win on the estate tax. Is that food enough for you to accept, even though you don't want to raise taxes? 
>> Although, two points, the estate tax is better than going back to a million dollar exclusion, 55%, tax rate or anything above that there shouldn't be any tacks on death. It shouldn't be a taxable event.<- regarding theation on people making above $400,000. Go back to 1993, the clinton era tax rates which the democrats want. 250,000 then taxed at 39 mt 6% the equivalent of $398,000 tow with according to a labor statistic bureau and regular inflation. It's not that great of a deal i don't think as it goes and it's taxing and still taxing small business men and women, and i don't like that at all. 
>> Representative gingrich, ali velshi, happy new year to you, sir. I want to talk to something that played out yesterday. You were a tough primary in the past and that was when you first signed the norquist pledge. Am I right? 
>> That's right. Absolutely. 
>> And grover norquist seems to have approved this deal. Approved plan b which a lot of republicans didn't support. He couldn't get it to a floor vote. Said this is okay. Guys like and you many like you across the country are in districts that are not competitive in the general election, they are competitive in the primary, so you have to tack to the side of your party. And that means that it makes it harder for guys like you to compromise, you are keeping an open mind. Given your general history, you wouldn't like this deal? 

[01:36:55]


>> You stated it perfectly. Grover gorgeous kwis well respected. Did I sign that pledge in 2002, and that was not just a pledge to grover norquist, u.S. A pledge to the constituents who voted for me over the other two guys, pretty good candidates as well. Grover could say theoretically we've gone over the cliff. Everyone's taxes have gone up, at least for 12 hours, and a vote would be a vote to lower taxes for everybody under $400,000, and I'm just not sure the people in the 11th of georgia will see it that way. I'm concerned they will see think it's just more smoke and mirrors and congress pulls these stunts all the time. Putting off the sequester for two months, kicking the can down the road this bill looks like it's raising revenue, but very little of anything about cutting subpoenaing. We kick the can down the road and will do that two months from now. 
>> Let me ask you this, then. Some logic -- grover and others put forward the idea that you get some kind of deal on the tack thing, not terribly painful to everybody. Follow the bitter medicine, to use a doctor's phrase. Can you move on and focus on entitlements and spending cuts? 
>> I heard republican colleagues in the senate to talk about that in anticipation of the overwhelming support of this deal that was cut. And they tried to explain that away and say this is the fiscal cliff. We have a fiscal grand canyon to deal with. And the president won round one and we'll sock it to him in round two, I don't know about that, two months, three months, we'll wait for round three and really get him. I mean, at one point this business of living to fight another day. You have to dig in your heels, by golly, this is important to the people of my country. 

[01:39:04]


>> That's not the most compromising view. But I appreciate your principles, sir. Phil gingrey from the 11th in georgia. Good to see you, happy new year. 
>> Thank you so much. Happy new year. 
>> He has not made up his mind yet. Doesn't sound like a yes vote. 
>> Based on data laid out there, doesn't sound like it. 
>> Fairly safe to say. Despite down to the wire fiscal cliff negotiations, somehow americans across the country managed to celebrate the arrival of the new year in spectacular style. The fiscal cliff not weighing them down at all. An estimated crowd of 1 million jammed into times square to watch the traditional ball drop. In las vegas, the amazing fireworks show lit up the sky over the strip. As 2013 rolled into town. Back here in new york, the sad scene after the ball drops. An army of sanitation workers descend on times square to gyp the monumental task of cleaning up. 
>> Those sanitation workers, impressive how they get that all cleaned up. 
>> I want to know how many sets of keys they start. 1 million people. 
>>> Still to many co, new details on secretary hillary clinton's health care. A blood clot in her skull. How serious could this be? We'll speak with a cardiologist. patients question, why does my mouth feel dryer than I remember it to be? There are more people taking more medication, so we see people suffering from dry mouth more so. We may see more cavities, bad breath, oral irritation. A dry mouth sufferer doesn't have to suffer. I would recommend biotene. The enzymes in biotene products help supplement enzymes that are naturally in saliva. Biotene helps moisten those areas that have become dry. Those that are suffering can certainly benefit from biotene. ?????? ??????

>>> welcome back, everyone. New information about the blood clot that put secretary of state hillary clinton in the hospital. The doctors revealed its located between her brain and skull. Mrs. Clinton being treated with blood thinners. We'll find out more about what that means. Joining us is dr. Hanna chadry, a cardiologist. She is not treating mrs. Clinton but has treated similar conditions. New year. 

[01:43:54]


>> Happy new year. 
>> Explain this type of blood clot to us. In general, how serious is this condition? 
>> The blood clot is found in a vain, in terms of secretary of state clinton's blood clot, instead of an artery, which means it's a lot less dangerous. In the artery, it most likely would have caused a stroke. And she most likely had neurologic symptoms. 
>> What kin? 
>> Nine out of ten will have a headache, and there can be other symptoms, including numbness of the face, numbness or weakness of one or both limbs, and in some cases seize seizures as well. 
>> Symptoms that can be alarng? 
>> People who have been listen to this out of one year have been hearing the issue of blood thinners. Blood clot, you think that can be treated with thinners pushgt people have aing because it's in the head, maybe blood thinners not the thing to use. 
>> Blood thinners are the thing to use, because the clot is sitting in the vain. And the blood thinner is the only thing that will dissolve the clot. In very rare circumstances you would go after it using a mother calledembolisation. But because it's in the vain, the blood thinners have been shown to work to resolve these clots. 
>> Thinners work? 
>> Yes. 
>> A few weeks ago secretary of state clinton fainted, banged her head. Did that cause this? 
>> This was probably discovered incidentally. A lot. People as they age have undetected clots, and the concussion probable caused some symptoms that prompted her to have her brain examined in the fist place and I bet it was discovered incidentally. 

[01:45:55]


>> Secretary of state clinton discovered a blood clot in her leg which she said it was the most serious health risk she experienced in her life. Is she more suscept nibl the future? 
>> Definitely. People who have had blood clots in the leg or brain have a higher susceptibility. May be factors in the blood that prevent adequate clotting or predispose people to clots and those have to be checked into. Deficiencies and certain factors in the blood. The other thing with secretary clinton, she travels a lot. A very hectic life-style, spends a lot of times on airplanes. 
>> Got to moe around on the planes for sure. 
>> You have to. Every hour. 
>> This was caught not by accident but maybe by coincidence. What would have happened if this most recent clot gone untreated. 
>> It could have caused swelling of brain. The place where it's sitting in the transverse sigh husband us in, if left untreated, fluid would have backed up in the brain, resulting in swelling and that can become potentially dangerous. 
>> But they did treat it, and their doctors affect a full recovery. 
>> Ali. 47 minutes past the hour. New this morning, you know the senate passed that plan which may keep our fall off the fiscal cliff. 
>> It will be a short one. The plan keeps the bush era tax cuts in place for individuals earning less than 400,000 and couples earning less than $450,000. The house meets later. All eyes on the house of representatives. 
>>> Civil rights activists known as the wilmington ten have been pardoned by north carolina's outgoing governor. Nine african-american men and one woman, convi firebombing a grocery store in 197. Sentences commuted in 1978. Convictions overturned two years later, but finally a pardon. The governor saying convictions were tainted by naked racism.

>> Thank you for having me on. 
>> A couple of stars in florida top your list. Tell me about it. 
>> Yeah, senator marco io and jeb bush, former governor of florida. Both of them have been long-time allies and also are seen as leaders on immigration reform in their rty. 
>> Think we'll hear from both of them. Scott brown. Scott brown has the chance to reclaim his senate seat that he lost with john kerry's appointment to the being secretary of state. He'll have a chance to come back. If he doesn't, he won't be running as a tea partier, the way he did when he first became senator there. He will be running as a moderate. Which might be forshaedoing of what's to come. 
>> A gun owner, nra member and talking about bans on assault rifled, and he's really been on the news. 
>> He came out, said it's time to do some gun control if we get gun control passed which president obama wants to make a major priority in the second term, he will probably be a central figure. Sort of a democratic ambassador to gun owners. 38-year-old mayor of san antonio. 
>> Julian castro. Gave an electrifying speech at convention and could run for state wide senate or governor in texas and that would obviously be a big deal since he's a democrat. But a lot of people think that state may be a blue state pretty soon. 
>> And everybody's favorite mayor, cory booker. 
>> He said he will explore senate election in 2013. And he will be doing a lot in the next year to kin of make his star rise even more in that state. He will probably pursue education reforl, budgetary reform, and keep an eye out for him.

>> Will probably use her perch on the senate banking committee to take the fight to wall street in a way a lot of democrats haven't and see her become a liberal hero and a bogey man for those on the right. 
>> Some of these names are names 've heard before, and some are new names. It shows -- I don't know a new lanscape for both parties. 
>> You see the republican party really try to embrace diversity, trying to move to the middle on some issues and on the left, you see some rising stars. It will be fun to watch kind of the jockeying over the next year, especially as we look forward to 2016, but also in the policy fights. 
>> Fun? I don't known I would use the word fun. 
>> For those who are political junkies. 
>> Nice to see you. John.

As we await some action on the fiscal cliff deal. We are live with the late-breaking developments as we wait to hear from congressional democrats. And the health crisis facing secretary of state hillary clinton. New details about her condition and how doctors are treating the blood clot that plea deal. A young mom facing jail time on child abuse charges, ordered not to get pregnant for the next 13 years. Is that legal? Our panel weighs in. And a very rare new year's day session for the house. Just hours after the senate passed its version of the fiscal cliff bill. 
>> House democratic leaders speaking now. Let's listen in on what they have to say. 
>> Gave us a thoughtful and detailed explanation of what's gone on and how it was that he and the president working with the democratic and republican leaders in both houses were able to come together on this compromise. We first want to say thank you to the vice president for being so gracious. Quite honestly so frank in his conversation with us in explaining as much as he could about what's transpired over the last several weeks. We now are waiting to hear from our republican colleagues whether or not they want to do what the senate did in a very bipartisan fashion and give the american people an opportunity to have a vote. There are people throughout this country who might look at this deal a love it, some might hate it, some may not understand it. But we firmly believe that every american this this country should have a right to vote in the people's house. The senate sent us a bill. We are hoping the house will respect the wishes of the american public and let the representatives of those people vote up or down on that legislation. And with that let me turn now to our leader, nancy pelosi. 

[00:02:02]


>> Thank you very much. Last night the senate -- well, guess it was early this morning, the united states senate voted in an uncharacteristically in a very bipartisan way 89 votes in favor of the compromise legislation. That was historic. That legislation was sent over to the house. Up until now our speaker has said when the senatects we will have a vote in the house. That is what he said. That is what we expect. That is what the american people deserve. So we look forward now as we go forward in this day to see what the timing will be for a straight up or down vote on what passed 89-8 last night in the united states senate. Today we had the privilege, as our chairman has said, from hearing from the vice president. He talked about what's in the legislation and what lies ahead and difficult negotiations as we go forward. We had a frank, as you said, mr. Chairman, a frank discussion in that regard. Our members after thoughtful dlir bracings and review are continuing to review the legislation weighing the pros and cons and weighing the equities of not going over the cliff, but we are all very eager to see the form that the republican leadership will put on to the floor today. I think we have made gigantic progress. I hope we can have a bipartisan agreement as we go forward, but as I said, our members are making their decisions now and we look forward to hearing from the republicans have to say. A person who will know best what our numbers are in this regard at some point are our distinguished master counter. 
>> Thank you very much, madam leader. 112th congress has about 46 hours left to go. This congress unfortunately has been most known for a unwillingness to compromise, an unwillingness to come together to act on behalf of the american people. TODAY IS JANUARY 1st. Taxes will be going up on everybody in america. In america if we don't act. Those relying on unemployment insurance, millions relying on unemployment insurance to make sure they can support themselves and their families. If we don't act, we will be at risk. Vice president biden has worked very hard to come to a compromise. By definition a compromise has elements in it that each party does not like, but by definition it has things in it each party should like of the the speaker said that if the senate passed a bill he would put it on the floor for a vote. The leader has pointed out we expect that to happen. We think that's in the best interest of the american people. We hope that our colleagues on the other side of the aisle can reach compromise. Our members are reviewing the specifics of the compromise that has been reaped to determine whether they can support that compromise. I am hopeful that this congress will as one of its last act, not only on ts compromise, but I am also very hopeful and would expect that we would provide the emergency assistance needed for the victims of sandy, one of the country's worst storms in history that damaged the northeast so badly. So I am hopeful we will be able to move on both of these issues, and that we will have members on both sides who perhaps will not agree, but hopefully we will have members on both sides who will agree, and we can act as the american people expect us to do so. 

[00:06:17]


>> Why don't we ask mr. Van holland. 
>> Thank you. I will be very brief. I think the difference between a divided government and dysfunctional government is the willingness to compromise. We saw that in the senate as leader paw -- leader pelosi and hoyer has said is looking at agreement and deciding it helps democrats and republicans and whether it helps move us forward. We are hopeful republicans on the house will do as democrats and republicans did on the senate and weigh all of the equities here, but decide at the end of the day that not everybody gets a hundred percent of what they want. Democracy means a willingness to come together for the good ??f the country. And that's what compromise is all about, especially in an era of divided government. Our members are taking a look at the bill, and we just would ask our republican colleagues to bear in mind the good of the country as they also weigh all of the equities here. And with that I turn it over to the distinguished vice chairman of the caucus, mr. Crowellly. 
>> Thank you. I will add very briefly, we all appreciate the vice president to come to the caucus in a straight forward, very thorough way explaining the process, the negotiation and why we are where we are at today. I do think though the time for discussion and talk is coming to an end. It is going to be time for us to vote soon. Or all of this would have been for not. Our being here new year's eve, new year's day and happy new year to everyone, would have been for not if we don't come to some point and have a vote. That's what the american people deserve. That's what the american people expect out of this process. We can either move forward in a bipartisan way, hand in hand, to avert the fiscal cliff or our republican colleagues could help lead us off that cliff. We hope that's not the case. 

[00:08:28]


>> Questions? 
>> If I can ask -- 
>> I think you were first. 
>> Can I just ask what are your spies on the other side in a sense telling you how it is going over there? You have to count heads with them as well. 
>> I am not stipulating to any charktization to any information we receive from our friends in the press. I really have no idea. 
>> -- To try to prove this. What are you hearing from the other side? 
>> I think your question is better addressed to the republicans coming out of their conference. We just came out of ours, and we know what you tell us as to at is coming out of theirs. 
>> We haven't had an opportunity to talk to their leadership at this point in time. 
>> You said a moment ago you would prefer a straight up or down vote on that. 
>> Absolutely. 
>> Is that because of the time, or is that because it is a deal brokered by the vice president? 
>> No, it was a bill that was passed in the united states senate 89-8. Tell me when you've had that on a measure as controversial as this. 
>> They had problems with that one almost to the number. 
>> Right, well I hope that we don't have a re-enactment of that where the republicans in the house painted themselves in the extreme of not wanting to find compromise in a solution. But let's be optimistic. Let us all as mr. Hoyer and others have said hope they decide in favor of the country as we go forward, but the issue whether we have an up or down vote shouldn't even be a question. There shouldn't even be a question. We were told we would not have any legislative -- legislation on the floor until and unless the senate acted, and when they did we would have a vote. And so we want to have that vote. We look forward to what the timing is on that. And this is all about time. It is about time that we brought this to the floor. As mr. Hoyer mentioned it has only been a matter of a couple of months since the election, eight weeks. And in that period of time we have been pushed into a mu year. It is long overdue for us to have a collusion to -- a solution to go forward and remove all doubt as to what comes next for our country. So we expect, the american people deserve, an up or down vote on what was passed in the senate. 

[00:11:06]


>> If there is an up or down vote, how many democratic votes would you have, would you be able to deliver? 
>> That isn't a subject I will be talking about right now. As we mentioned all of us -- 
>> members are considering the legislation. They just heard from the vice president, and we will find out which members -- 
>> if you are saying you want bipartisan ship from the other side, don't you have to say that you are willing to support this piece of legislation? 
>> I don't think there is any doubt we will have bipartisan ship. She asked me for a number. I can tell you we will have a bipartisan vote. 
>> Thank you very much. 
>> When will you start -- 
[inaudible] 
>> you have been listening to house democratic leaders regarding the senate bill that was agreed to in the early morning hours. That bill would let income tax rates rise for the first time in 20 years, maintain unemployment benefits for millions of people, also blunt the impact of spending cuts that were looming as part of that so-called fiscal cliff. Just to briefly summarize for you, the senate bill will raise taxes on incomes of $450,000 for couples $400,000 for individuals, cuts $15 billion in spending while increase tax revenues by $620 billion. That's a 41-1 ratio of tax increases to spending cuts. The senate voted 89-8 in favor of the package. Thousand putting it into the hands of the house. So now we are here. Chief congressional correspondent mike emmanuel is live for us on capitol hill. Mike, do you think they will act? We heard nancy pelosi asking for the straight up or down vote. Take us through the steps. What would that involve? What does that mean? 
>> It is interesting, heather, listening to that. Everybody on capitol hill is wondering what the house republicans thinks about the deal. The deal was struck by the vice president and the senate republican leader. The house republicans haven't embraced it yet. They have been meeting behind closed doors. There are a lot of questions about what they are hearing about republican support, how many democratic votes they can bring to the table. The straight up or down vote is they are saying they want to vote on the bill as passed in the senate by a wide bipartisan margin last night. That's interesting because a fairly senior house republican said a very short time ago that he cannot imagine this bill passing in the house without it being sent back to the senate with some amendments. Spending cut amendments which a lot of house republicans have heartburn because they say there should be more spending cuts in this bill, but we are running out of time. You heard that point also made. There is 46 hours left in this congress before a new congress is sworn in. Ping-ponging back and forthwith amendments gets complicated. We are waiting to see what the house republicans decides to do. Heather? 

[00:14:11]


>> A busy couple days and the time is limited. Thank you so much, mike emmanuel. We will check back in with you. 
>> Quick break and then much more on the fiscal cliff. And the rogue nation iran engaging in war games this new year's day. The country test firing weapons near a critical piece of real estate. A live report from the middle east straight ahead. 

[00:16:38]


>>> Welcome back. We just heard from the democrats in the house asking for a straight up or down vote on the senate's version of the fiscal cliff bill. The number two republican in the house of representatives just speaking out. We are just getting word that he has told the republicans in the house that he is opposed to the senate's version of this bill, and that could be critical. So let's take a look at what this could mean for your bottom line. First of all the bill as it stands right now, the one passed in the senate would end the payroll tax cut, hikes taxes on income above $450,000 a year for families. It makes the alternative minimum tax patch permanent. It also extends unemployment benefits for the long-term jobless and proposed spending defense and non-spending cuts. For a look at the economic impact, let's talk to the managing partner at chap wood investments. It seems like this will be tough to get through the house of representatives, but for our conversation right now we can talk about what we know about the senate versionf this. What do you think? 
>> Well, I will tell you, it is not surprising. What people don't understand, when you don't have a bill where you are addressing spending, what you are saying is we have all of these programs. How are we going to pay for them? What the government does is goes out and literally prints money. When that happens, it makes the prices of everything you spend money on go up because the value of the dollar, our currency, goes down. That's why when you hear tax hikes versus spending, that's why he is coming back saying i have a problem. There are no spending cuts which means prices will go up. The only way to pay for this stuff is to print money which is going to slow our economy down even further. 
>> I know, but ed, everybody has been saying for months now that if a deal isn't worked out that the country will go back into a recession. So here we have republicans in the house who have legitimate gripes with this bill that passed through the senate that involves absolutely no spending cuts, and yet if they stand in the way of its passage, are they not sort of helping us over and putting us back into a recession? 

[00:18:49]


>> Yes, well, it is debatable whether we will go into a recession one way or another. But we will definitely go into a recession if we go over the fiscal cliff. It is really a shame we are in this discussion right now and at this point. What will happen most likely the house of representatives will come out and do an up or down vote at some point. Saying that before we went on is a major deal. Apparently they will want to go in and pick away at this, and not just take the senate bill and vote on it. We are still at this cliff at this moment. Do I like this bill? Of course not. It doesn't do anything. I like the fact it keeps unemployment insurance. I like the fact that we are not doing it at $250,000 and looking at $400,000 or higher, but it won't do anything for the economy. The economy is in rig rigormortis and nothing is stimulating it, and that's what we need. 
>> Democrats will certainly blame republicans especially tomorrow when the markets open up. And if there is no deal or if the prospects of the deal seem bleak, the markets are not going to like that. 
>> No, they are not. Markets like clarity. One way or another we need clarity. If we do go over the fiscal cliff, even if in the short time. We are already seeing taxes go up across the board. You know the 3.8% obamacare tax and an increase most likely on those that earn $400,000 or more will go up quite a bit on a percentage basis. So we are going to see a slower economy, less money in the economy, and the stock market doesn't like that because corporations won't earn as much. Everybody needs to put on their seatbelt because this will last for a longtime, even going into the debt conversation that will happen in about two months from now. Things are a mess, and we need to get things straight eped out quickly. 
>> He is the managing partner at chap wood, happy new year. We will talk again soon. 
>> You too. Take care. 
>>> New details emerging about the deadly september 11th attack on our consulate in libya. What we are now learning about the changes made to the talking points about the attack. Plus, an oil rig trying to get out of the path of a major storm runs aground. This is off the coast of alaska. New information on the environmental threat up next.Pa ?? 

[00:24:22]


>>> welcome back. New information on a story we have been following for you. There appears to be no oil leaking from a shell oil rig that has now run a ground off the coast of alaska. The rig was being towed away from the path of a massive storm when the cables snapped for a second time. Crews worked to make sure the rig ran aground in an area that would pose the least risk to the environment. All 18 crew members on board have been evacuated. They are now working on getting the rig moving again. 
>>> A senate report just out shedding new light on the aftermath of the deadly terror attack on our consulate in libya in september. The report faulting intelligence agencies for not focusing closely enough on libyan extremists. Stating it was the fbi, the cia and other intel sources that changed official talking points about the attack and not the white house. Ambassador susan rice had been under fire for weeks about comments she made right after the attack leading some lawmakers to question whether the presidential staff had rewritten the talking points for political reasons ahead of the election in november. He is the former senior advisor. Happy new year, happy to see you, christian. Thanks for being here. 
>> What do you make of the senate report? 
>> Unfortunately it doesn't shed that much light on the issue. There are ways the talking points can be manipulated without the white house staff sitting down with a red pen and changing them. This report says the changes were made at the agency. It is perfectly easy and reasonable for white house staff to pick up a phone and say, you know, it would be better if them pho sized the possibility of a movie causing these protests rather than the real cause which was the al-qaeda affiliate who planned and executed the uhing tay. The key issue remains. There are a lot of questions about the talking points that remains. 
>> The white house said they only changed one word, and this report from the senate committee also says that as far as their investigators were able to uncover, there wasn't a lot of actual changes that were put in place by the white house staffers. So what makes you so sure? I guess, yes, politically ahead of an uh election where a president is running for re-election with the idea al-qaeda is on the run and he is securing america and americans all over wouldn't want this kind of thing to happen, but what other evidence is there, concrete evidence that in fact the white house was more involved in what has been stated? 

[00:26:58]


>> There is a lack of concrete evidence because the administration hasn't made any senior principals who have had direct knowledge of the political chain of events that took place in the white house. We learned a lot more about what happened minute by minute in benghazi and not in the white house. The fact thatan rice and hillary clinton have not been up to testify yet is one of the problems. There is another issue that makes me certain. Senior principals if you are the president and the ambassador to the u.N, susan rice or hillary clinton you get a treasure trove of intelligence when important events break. Including susan rice and jay carney who went out on tv who said this was a reaction to a movie would have seen lots of intelligence from realtime overhead imagery during the attack from radio communications that came in realtime from the attack. All of that would have said terrorist attack. So to come out days later and say it wasn't, we have lost sight of the bigger intelligence picture here which said terrorist attack. 
>> I'm sure you saw or heard what the president said on "meet the please" this pass sunday when asked about benghazi. He called it sloppiness. He said it was unintentional. I am wondering if you think there will ever come a time when we think that's what it was or if there's something more to it. 
>> I think what would have to happen is a real congressional investigation. This is one respect by one committee in the senate which is democratic controlled. I think the house will is have to hold hearings. I think the only way the administration will give up real witnesses and provide information, the executive branch has always had a history of over classifying information that does not need to be concealed from the american people. To get real witnesses and real formation, the house will have to threaten the state department's budget, and then you have the bureaucrats throwing the politicals under the table which is the opposite of what is happening now where the politicals are throwing the bureaucrats under the table. 
>> Good to see you, thanks for coming in. 

[00:29:01]


>>> Coming up, more reaction to the deal. We will take a look at which players will come out winners and which will be the losers in this big fight. Plus a wet and wild start to 2013. Who took the icy plunges in a new year's tradition. That's up next. 

[00:31:55]


>>> New developments in the fiscal cliff fight, and we are live on capitol hill as we now await action in the house of representatives on the senate bill which passed pretty overwhelmingly. Eric cantor now saying he opposes that bill. This is -- this as house democrats got a visit from mitch McConnell and hammered out this deal. Brett joins us now. How significant that cantor came out against this? 
>> Good afternoon. It is very significant he said publicly that he opposes the senate bill. The real question is whether as house majority leader that he will be with other voters voting against a piece of legislation that hits the floor, or whether it moves to the floor at all. You heard the democratic leader, nancy pelosi, come out calling for an up or down vote as soon as possible. We don't know the plan for republicans. We are just getting word from the speaker's spokesperson saying there will be conversations throughout the afternoon suggesting this could take some time after the house gop caucus meeting we are told by reporters and producers up there that members were coming out saying it seemed likely that there would be a process to amend the senate bill, and then send it back with additional spending cuts. There was universal concern er gop members about the lack of spending cuts in the senate bill. The compromise bill that passed from the senate. If that happens, if the house amends it and sends it back, then senator reid would have to take up the house bill and act or choose not to, and we could either have a ping-pong match between the senate and the house dealing with amendments back and forth, or you could have a real stall, and the thing could go no where. 
>> It could go no where because this congress is about to end. The bill that passed in the senate, am I right, becomes null and void as of when, tomorrow afternoon sometime? 

[00:34:03]


>> Actually thursday at noon is when the new congress is set to be sworn in. Technically the senate bill expires at that time when the new congress is sworn in. Now whether parlimentary procedure could be invoked and they could delay the new congress from coming in, i think we would have to talk to the experts about that, but what we are looking at now potentially is another long night is the bottom line here. And remember that you are going to start to see economic reaction if this starts to signal like this might not happen. You have the asian markets opening up tonight. We will get our first indication of what the world thinks of all of this back and forth in washington. And then tomorrow the u.S. Markets react for the first time to whatever happens here in washington over the next 24 hours. 
>> It is not going to be good. It will get messy quickly. Brett, happy new year to you and your family. You can see 6:00 p.M. Eastern on a special edition of "special report" and will be here -- as he said it will be a long night and a long night for brett depending on breaking news in dc. We will have it here for you on fox. 
>> More now on the fallout from the fiscal cliff deal as we take a look at the major players on both sides of the aisle. We try to figure out the winners and losers in this big fight according to the washington post. The winners were -- the winner were vice president joe biden, senate minority leader mitch McCONNELL, PRESIDENT OBAMA And west virginia senator joe manchen and legislative jargon. The losers, congress, president obama, makes both lists, and awful those new year's eve plans. For a fair and balanced analysis now with democrat from texas and brad blakman. Thank you for joining us and happy new year's day, i guess. 

[00:36:04]


>> Happy new year. Thank you. 
>> We are talking about the winners and the losers in all of this. On that list from the washington post, a lot of politicians. You know what really matters in this is the american people. I want to know from both of you who wins in this? It is still not even over. Brad, I will start with you. 
>> Heather, the american people are the big losers. They are not winni in this deal. We don't have a revenue problem. We have a spending problem. We should have been dealing with spending first. There should have bee a bill and we should have dealt with see -- sequestration. There were two house bills, one on spending and taxation that the senate never took up. The bottom line is this, when you govern out of duress instead of deliberation, it is always a mess. It is always a crisis with the president and the senate and not moving legislation, and that's why we are in the mess we are in. The american people have lost. 
>> This doesn't deal with sequestration. It delays budget cuts in the defense department for two months. 
>> That's correct. We have to wait and see what kind of additional measures will be taken on sequestration as they kick that can down the road 30 days. 
>> The republicans may be in the process of snatching defeat from the jaws of victory. If they block this they will, I think, be blamed. What happened was they got a lot in the negotiations. They took care of some of the wealthier supporters. They got the exemption on the estate racks to $5 million for a couple. They got the bush tax cuts to stay in affect for people up to $400,00 they actually won a lot in these negotiations, but they can't accept victory. If they scuttle this thing, the republicans will suffer greatly in terms of public attitude. This passed overwhelmingly in the senate on a bipartisan vote. 
>> That is true. When it comes to spending cuts, the ratio 14-1, how do you feel about that? Where are the spending cuts, and is there a guarantee they would come down the road? 

[00:38:12]


>> What happened was they got to the point of talking about one year of sequestration and that is $110 billion. They decided they would only delay it for two months and en if they delayed it for an entire year, that would have been about $55 billion worth of cuts. They were going to do it half and half. They did $14 billion of cuts as opposed to 55 billion. They never talked about the grand bargain and the big picture. There is no question about that. I would hope, assuming that this thing does finally pass, and both the democrats and the republicans get serious about budget cuts in terms of the long haul, that needs to be done. We have to get past this. This is nuts to discuss tell this deal and have the stock market down and be the laughing stock of the world after the republicans and the senate voted for it. 
>> It hit world markets tonight, I believe. Thank you for joining us. We appreciate it. We'll see what happens. 
>> Thank you. 
>>> Coming up, a mom of four convicted of child abuse, but a big controversy is brewing because a judge actually banned her from having anymore kids until 20 to 25. Is that legal? Our panel weighs in coming up next. 

[00:42:00]


>>> An unusual plea deal catching our attention. A uom in florida facing serious jail time after being convicted of leaving her four kids, all under the age of 12 at one time, and one with special needs, at a hotel while she went out to party. The judge had a different idea. Instead of jail he ordered her to not have anymore children while she serves 13 years on probation. That would take us to the year 2025. After initially agreeing to the deal, the woman could be having second thoughts and may appeal this judge's decision. Our legal panel joins us. Both former prosecutors and the criminal defense attorneys, guys, happy new year and happy to see you both. 
>> Thank you. Happy new year. 
>> Is this legal? Can a judge tell someone they are not allowed to have children? 
>> Absolutely not. Not at all. What happens here, I think the court missed it in a couple of critical come pone nepts. The first, backing up a minute, you have a woman who now is a multiple convicted felon as a result of leaving her children alone. That is a harsh thing. She should not have left the children alone. I understand that. Now is an opportunity to rehabilitate her and perhaps do community service or something else. Now she is faced with the prospect of being a criminal, and her future employment prospects are not there. How she will be able to support them is beyond me. Moving to the critical question about what can a court do? The constitution gives us a lib pea interest. The liberty interest says the woman has a right to choose. We know that from roe-v-wade. And they called sterilization inappropriate and improper. It will not stand. 
>> They say the judge can't do that. 
>> It is not for the rest of her life. It is for the term of probation. And while 13 years is too long, it would seem to me as a practical matter the judge would have her in relatively quickly. The second point I want to make is that joey knows this because we were discussing it. There was a case in the wisconsin supreme court in 2001 in which they were saying that a dead beat dad, somebody who was seriously in default on child support, the judge said you cannot have a child unless you come forward first and establish to the court you are capable of affording it. By analogy to here, I agree with joeyment you can't flat out prohibit somebody from having children, but you could theoretically have them say, you have to come in and establish that you are going to be able to do this properly. 

[00:44:28]


>> Have I to say a woman with four kids who leaves them in a hotel unattended to go to a party should probably not be having more children anyway. But that aside, let's ask about these creative sentences. We hear about them evero often. There was a case where a judge was -- where a judge ordered a husband to take his wife out and go bowling. You see signs people wear stating they will not do the behavior that got them into trouble. The judges that hand these kinds of sentences, these plea deals, joey, how much leeway do they have to come up with this stuff? 
>> Generally doug and I love these sentences. Why? It keeps our clients out of jail. Usually what happens, rick, is that a judge will get the consent of the particular defendant, and as a result of that, you are waiving your right. If a judge says, take your wife out to dinner as opposed to arguing with her and as opposed to discourse and fights, I will say, fine, your honor. That's in lieu of a year in jail. Judges often times met out other sentences that are alternative sentences and are a bit creative, but they get the consent. In this particular case the judge goes a little too far when he says, you know what, you are not an appropriate caregiver for the children. Do not have anymore children for 13 years which in affect is a life sentence based on the age of the person having these children. And so therefore in this case they went too far 
>> final word on these creative sentences that judges sometimes hand down. Are they ever a deterrent? 
>> It is funny. They had one in new york, on a drunk driving condition. Convicted of drunk driving and it was stricken down. If I was an nfl referee i think it is an illegal sennence it. Sentence. 
>> Gentlemen, happy new year to you and your family and thank you for coming in. 
>> Happy new year. 
>>> One of the biggest storiesof 2012, superstorm sandy. Long island, new york city and nerming new jersey all braced for the -- and new jersey braced for the storm, but nobody could have predicted sandy's immense devastation. And new information on the head injury of secretary of state hillary clinton. What she is battling. Coming up, what her health crisis could mean for her political future. 

[00:49:59]


>>> Welcome back. 2012 was a brutal year for weather in the u.S. Mother natured tested in every conceivable way. Nice dean takes a look now at the wild weather year that was 2012. 2012 has more than its fair share of wild weather. Whether it was destructive, deadly or just plain hot, extreme weather affected americans in every part of the country. After a mild winter for most, spring roared in with tornadoes. Twisters tore through several states wiping out communities and killing several people. A devastating ef4 tornado with winds up to 200 miles per hour hit the midwest. Henryville and maryville completely obliterated. Heartbreaking stories of families ripped apart like this tragic case of angel babcock. She survived, but died later from her injuries. And there was scorching temperatures throughout the east coast and the midwest. Along with historic drought conditions, with the soaring temperatures the communities struggled to maintain water supplies. Farmers harvested just a fraction of their crops. Ranchers weren't able to feed their cattle. It was the worst drought in 50 years that plagued two-thirds of the nation. The drought conditions made it ripe for wildfires. The waldo canyon fire raged for days killing two people and destroying over 300 homes and scorching over 18,000 acres. It was fuelled by the dry brush and the fierce winds. The unrelenting heat also proved deadly in the mid-atlantic and the midwest states after july's storms killed at least 22 people across the area. It also knocked out power leaving millions sweltering. Heat-related death climbed to 20 in the chicago area. The big easy was not spared this year. Hurricane isaac making landfall near new orleans on the eve of the seventh anniversary of hurricane katrina. Isaac made landfall as a category 1 hurricane. The slow-moving storm drenched low-lying coastal areas. Here is one of the hardest hit areas, plaqueminess parish. It then moved inland innun ditting communities in -- inundating communities in arkansas. An eerie site over phoenix as a dust storm blows in. Winds gusting up to 40 miles an hour and bringing dust and sand from the desert. 2012 also saw the birth of a superstorm. A devastating hurricane that collided with a powerful cold system from canada that slamd the northeast. Sandy made landfall in south jersey in late october flooding beach communities, submerging highways and washing iconic boardwalks into the ocean. New york city's downtown skyline fell dark. In breezy point, queens, homes went up in flames. Areas of long island, staten island filled with debris. Sandy claimed 100 lives and changed the landscape of the jersey shore. And just a week later another blow when the area was blanketed by snow, sleet and rain from a nor' easter. According to fema, vicious heat waves, wildfires, hurricanes and severe storms will cost this year alone more than $100 billion in repair costs. In new york, janice dean, fox news. 

[00:53:36]


>> And janice tells us that 2013 will start off pretty quietly, at least weather wise for most people. A bit of rain in the south. Light snow in the ohio valley and across the rockies. Otherwise dry and chilly in most areas. 
>>> Continuin to follow one of our top stories, doctors are treating secretary of state hillary clinton fo a blood clot. The clot is in a dangerous location. It is between her brain and her skull. So just how serious is this, and what is her prognosis for the future? Dr. Lee from lsu health sciences center. Thank you for joining us. 
>> My pleasure. 
>> What are the potential implications for the blood clot, where it is located and how are you reading it? 
>> Well, I mean, it is hard without seeing the patient, but truthfully -- potentially it can be very dangerous. Now, it is extremely rare to have this kind of clot in the vein after a mild concussion. If you don't have something like a skull fracture that tears some of the membranes there, but this type of clot is related to other conditions. If you have blood disorders where your blood clots too readily, you can sometimes get it if you have infection, and postpartum, it is common in women in the postpartum period. And then the clot itself can cause a back up of blood and can lead to damage of the brain and sort of like a little stroke in that area. But her doctors are reporting she doesn't have any symptoms like a stroke. They seem to think they caught it early, and they are giving her medicines to stop the clotting anti-coagulation. That takes a couple days to regulate that. 
>> And she has a past history of clots, I understand, as well. Back in 19198 -- back in 1998 a dvt in her leg. 
>> That makes you think she has a hyper coaguable state and she is traveling all the time and you can get dehydrated on planes. She is not traveling -- you know, blood clots in your legs are called economy class clots which I'm sure she is traveling on her own plane and she can get up and walk during travel, but sometimes you get dehydrated. She is working all the time, and so that might have contributed to it. With a mild concussion alone, it is rare. 

[00:56:00]


>> So she is a secretary of state, a public servant. Talk to me about the recovery and the treatment for this, and would recuff reand treatment in a situation like this affect her ability to do her work either in the immediate or long-term? 
>> No, I mean it really shouldn't -- if she has no problems related to stroke or impairment from this right now, and they have stopped, she is on good anti-coagulation. She might need to be on the anti-coagulation for life if she has a sticky blood syndrome. She might need this for life, but it really shouldn't impair it. But it is just something she will have to pay attention to and take medications and keep well hydrated. 
>> So she could possibly still be on this treatment and testify about benghazi? 
>> Oh yes, absolutely. Once she is feeling better and out of the hospital, and once they get her level. They have to regulate your level. 
>> Thank you so much for joining us. Happy new year. 
>> My pleasure. Same to you. 
>>> We are continuing to watch the situation in dc. House republicans counting some votes, trying to figure out what they are going to do next after the senate passing their version of the fiscal deal. The latest on that and then neil cavudo hosts "fly me to the moon." 
>> Have a great new year. Bye.

=======================================================

"Anderson cooper 360" starts right now. 
>> Thanks, wolf. We're going to pick up right now, it hit the senate and then hit the house, deals mainly with restoring middle class tax cuts. Let listen to nancy pelosi right now. 
>> I believe that we will heed the american people, come together with a strong vote. We will increase by voting for this legislation and passing it in a strong bipartisan way, we'll increase the confidence of consumers, of the markets, of businesses, of employers to hire more. We will extend unemployment insurance to people who have lost their jobs through no fault of their own. This is very, very important. Not only to those individuals but to our economy because this is money that is spent immediately injecting demand into the economy creating jobs. We'll extend permanent tax relief for the middle class, for more than 98% of american taxpayers, more than 97% -- 
>> jessica yellin and dana bash working their sources to stay ahead. Dana, when do we expect a vote to take place, within this hour? 
>> We do now. It's been moved up a little bit according to the republicans who run the show here. They say they do expect it probably within the next half hour to 45 minutes. Perhaps it means that members are as tired as everybody else is, that they want to fin, the debate and go back. But one thing that I just mentioned before and I think it's worth saying again and that is the procedural vote that took place to get to us this point was very, verybig, a big bipartisan vote, 408 members voted for it and that means almost all of the democrats voted for it. It is significant in that this is the kind of procedural vote that is almost always pretty partisan and it really does signal as you're hearing from the democratic leader, ny pelosi on the floor, that it is going to be a bipartisan vote. 

[00:02:20]


>> What accounts for that? Earlier in the day there was all sorts of dissension, eric cantor among others, saying they weren't going to go for it. 
>> He may at the end of the day vote no. You're going to see a lot of republicans and a fair number of democrats vote no as well. What accounts for that is this is I think a classic compromise that nobody likes, meaning everybody lost things that they want and that is actually the way legislating used to be, that not everybody is happy but you realize you got to do what's best in order to actually get something passed. 
>> In terms of the white house, do they view this as a win for the president? 
>> Yes. This is something the president campaigned on and what's in this bill is largely -- largely democratic priorities, anderson. 450,000 as the threshold wasn't what the president wanted but in principle that is the notion that the president wanted, tax increases for the wealthiest americans. It extends unemployment benefits for a year and it's not paid for. Republicans wanted it paid for. But think about some of the other measures. They're doing things like patching this doctor payments but they're not doing it through medicare retirement age increase, something that the republicans want. They're not taking a bite out of entitlements. So the way they've engineered this bill, it's largely formed to win as many democratic votes as possible, precisely because they knew that they would need as many democratic votes as possible because it would go down exactly the way it's going down tonight. There's a lot for republicans -- there's some things for the republicans to like tonight but it's a win for the president tonight. 
>> What did it take to get the vot today? 
>> As far as the way the republicans in the house go, they have to wind themselves up and then you have to allow themselves to wind themselves back down. That is the way this day went from start to finish. The republicans were not happy with the senate vote, even though 40 out of 45 republican senators voted for this. I mean, it was overwhelming among republicans in the early morning hours this morning. But republicans simply are upset about the fact that it does raise taxes on wealthy americans, it doesn't address spending cuts enough and as jessica was saying, it doesn't address entitlements the way that they wanted it to. So what we saw today were a series of meetings where republicans vented and the house speaker and others listened and they were trying to craft a way to get this result but allow people to basically go through the process of grieving is the way another source put it, to understand they're not going to get what they want. There was discussion and a move to potentially amend this at $300 billion in spend being cuts but the tactic that the house republican leadership used was to say we'll see if we can get the majority votes to do that. If not we'll put this on the house floor up-or-down vote and at the end house republicans behind closed doors relented big time because they stand the politics of this would be so, so bad for house republicans, who are already basically the bad guys for a lot of what has happened with regard to this dragging out. They did not want to be in a position for this continue, particularly when the markets open tomorrow morning and americans to suffer. 

[00:06:00]


>> The tax piece of this bill for the democrats, what does it accomplish? 
>> Well, it raises the rate for the highest income americans, which was a fundamental principle for the president. And it keeps down the rate for 98% of americans, which is another principle for the president. And then it sort of puts it aside. If you think of the dinner plate and you got to deal with the protein, the vegetables and the starch, it takes one portion of that and puts it aside. It says we have done our protein and now we have to deal with the star of and vegetables in the next fight. I would say, anderson, as much as this is a win for the president, we should also acknowledge that this is a permanent extension of the bush tax cuts for 98% of americans. That's something that even president bush couldn't get passed. He only got it done for a decade. So president obama has permanently extended the bush tax cuts. So tonight republicans should be happy about that piece of it. The one piece they didn't get is the continuation of it for a sliver of americans. And some democrats are upset that that has happened today. 
>> In terms of revenue, it's not a huge amount of revenue. 
>> It's not a huge amount of revenue. Well, you know, what is huge. As I recall some $600 billion over ten years. 
>> Ten years. 
>> And it's also this principle that this is now codified into law and it's going to be very hard to change if they make an effort to change it. The other piece of this that's a win for republicans is that they're even having this larger skirmish over deficits and spending, which is a republican priority and the president is arguing on republican turf right now. 
>> Right. A lot more to cover, dana, jessica, I appreciate it. We're going to be talking to you throughout this hour, as dan ashe was just reporting. Do expect the vote to occur within this hour. Stay tuned for this. You can follow me on twitter also. We'll have more on the vote coming up on the fiscal cliff, on the bill, what americans and the markets think of the mess in the market.

>>> Breaking news tonight. The fiscal cliff bill is now heading for a vote possibly within this hour, probably within this hour. It fails to do anything about spending, merely pushes the deadline forward. In other words, get ready for another battle a couple months from now. 
>>> So it looks like this is going to pass, margaret, from the republican perspective. How do you see it? 
>> A lot of republicans are not going to vote for this, as we know. Talked to a couple of folks on the hill today, they are extremely frustrated, responsible republicans, moderate republicans, who aren't going to vote for this because they feel out of control on the spending. They don't understand how six to eight weeks from now they'll have any more leverage on spending than they did now, a year ago or ever had. There's a lot of frustration from those who I think a lot of us would call responsible republicans. 
>> Though there are lots of liberals who are concerned, the fact the president has moved from his $250,000 position to $450,000. 
>> This is the very nature of compromise. You're not going to get everything that you want. You will have to kick -- people use this analogy all day, kick the can down the road a bit. You have to come back to it, live to fight another day and say I will deal with what we can deal with now. If we can do that, they will have a chance to deal with it. 
>> Isn't that what governance used to be? Is this governance, ali? 
>> No. I think it's important to note there are far fewer competitive districts in the country now. Instead of doing something because you're worried that somebody from the other party will take your seat, you're doing something because you're worried somebody will challenge you in the primary. 
>> That's a republican thing. 
>> We have that, public finance law, come stant campaigning and this idea that if you compromise in any fa you're not doing the right thing for the governance of the country, you're giving something up, you're caving. Going from $250,000 to $450,000, it was a sign of we're going to have to compromise to get what we want. You've seen the people who will not compromise. I'm talking about marco rubio and rand paul and all these guys who are jockeying for position. They're going to run for something. 

[00:13:34]


>> What you have, anderson, is republicans are all over the map. You have the republicans you just mentioned, ali and you have republicans in the house of representatives who want to vote for it who can't. You have the republicans in the senate, the majority voted for THIS and McConnell is a huge winner because he was able to deliver most of his republicans to do it. The reason it still happened is because of him and joe biden. So republicans are completely scattered. There is no central messaging from the republican party on this. Guess who else is missing in action. Reince priebus, the chairman of the republican party. Where is he? He's got elections coming up in four weeks. 
>> What does this mean about the tea party? Didn't boehner try to go around them basically? 
>> I think the tea party has been weakened significantly in the last presidential election. Only 21% of americans said they identified as supporters of the tea party. Their kind of control over the republican partys substantially weaker. I do think you have hit tonight head, margaret. There's a centralized feel being among democrats that they can make compromises and they will not pay the ultimate price for that compromise. That is no longer something that is in the kind of dna of the republican party. We don't need to make any kind of false equivalencies here, this is a republican problem. They are no longer able to govern as a kind of full fledged party. 
>> Charles, there's one economic argument that has come apart here and that is the tea party conservative republican argument that we want a government that spends money responsibly, doesn't overtax people. That got divorced from the idea that we ended up with people defend being the rights of people who earn more than $500,000 a year not to pay 4.6 percentage points higher in taxes. We went from protecting responsible government and your hard-earned money into just defending rich people. That didn't make sense. 

[00:15:42]


>> Republicans had a hard time countering president obama's message, which is the you grow the economy by growing it from the middle class out. It's the one argument the republicans haven't come up with a cogent response to. I would say it's a republican house of representatives governing problems. It looked like the senate did okay today. 
>> This is the house they control. 
>> Correct. You basically have a vacuum in republican leadership, you don't have the presidency, don't have the senate and the house of representatives is controlling these members -- 
>> they have extreme positions. 
>> And that goes across the board in congress. As you know and as ali just said, all of these house districts have become more polarized. There are less in the incoming class, only 14 in thene that is going to start on thursday and 50 tea party republicans with a diminishing number of moderates in both parties. 
>> We're watching the debate live on the house floor. We anticipate the vote occurring relatively shortly, in the next 20, 30 minutes or so. In terms of this getd decided tonight, what's the next schedule? We still have another vote two months from now. 
>> There are three different things now. The first is the debt ceiling, WHICH WE HIT ON DECEMBER 31st, Yesterday. The treasury can do what they did last time. They've got $200 billion that they can shuffle around and keep us going for maybe another month. So I'm calling that the valentine's day cliff. That's the republicans have leverage on. Then you got the sequester, those cuts across the board, half in defense and half in nondefense. This agreement postpones that for two months. And then the one we all forget about, it is the government's job to actually come one a budget, something that has not been done in several years -- 
>> which is crazy. 
>> Crazy. That is actually not technically due until september except we're about three years overdue. Immediately we'll have a budget debate. We'll have three very distinct debates where these same discussions are going to take place. 
>> To be fair, it the senate that hasn't passed the budget in three years. 

[00:17:46]


>> For the average american, it's the government that hasn't passed the budge. 
>> The only constitutional responsibility the united states has and it's the one thing toe-the-don't do. You're right. About bu when you're the average voter, you need to get your act together. 
>> But you can give the house republicans a little credit. 
>> I will give them credit when this passes tonight because finally they'll be getting something done. 
>> Grover norquist holds no elected offense, no official title. He's a lobbyist, president of americans for tax reform. He's been a central figure in this and every tabs debate washington has had for 20 years. For those two decks aid, his position on taxes has been simple -- don't raise them, no time, ever, never. This time he says the senate tax deal is kind of sort of okay and that's got a lot of people somewhat confused. Grover norquist johns us now. You said the voting for this deal, which increases taxes on households earning more than 450,000 annually would not violate your pledge that lawmakers make to their constituents. Help our viewers understand that. Lawmakers who sign that pledge promised to oppose any effort increase tax rates for individuals, for businesses. Howe does the fiscal cliff deal not violate that pledge. 
>> It's technically not a violation of the pledge. But I understand why a lot of republicans have said, look, even though what's happening is the tax cuts disappear and we're restoring them for for most people, so we're not raising taxes, we're actually cutting taxes. 
>> You say because the bush tax cuts have expired yesterday. 
>> Yes. 
>> So technically they are still tax cuts. 
>> Correct. I understand and I understand if you're a congressman or senator, you've got to convince not me that you haven't violated the pledge, you have to convince your constituents. And they need to be able to say with a straight face they fought to protect those tax cuts for everyone. And the republicans have done that more than once and they're fighting to oppose any and all tax increases period. I think can you look your voters in the face and say we voters in the face and say we voted to protect them. The president in the white house vetoed the bill, here is the best we can do right now. And we continue to fight for everyone going forward. 

[00:20:29]


>> Is compromise that dirty of a word? For things to work, is this a good system, to constantly have this brinkmanship, these battles that go late into the night? This is just the beginning of it. It's not even the end of it. Critics say your pledge limits the flexibility the members of congress congress might otherwise have to make compromises. 
>> Define compromise, okay? Richard nixon and ted kennedy could compromise very easily. Richard nixon wanted the government to get birg and ted kennedy wanted it to get much bigger. Today they are committed to principle. The democrats wanted an expansive view of the role of government. The republicans want lower taxes and spending less money. If somebody wants to go east and somebody wants to go west, what would a compromise be? I'm in favor of compromising in favor of -- we had a come mieds in 2011. The republicans wanted to cut taxes $6 trillion and we agreed to $2.5 trillion in spending cuts. Dhafs-- that was a compromise. You can have compromise in the direction of liberty but raises taxes and spending more money, which is what obama wants to do is moving away from liberty. 
>> But you're painting it in extraordinarily stark terms. 
>> That's two parties are extraordinarily want to go in two different ways. 
>> Do you have see any room in the pentagon budget for cuts? 
>> Absolutely. Serious conservatives need to make it very clear that taxpayers, republicans, conservatives are looking at the entire budget and saying where can we be more efficient and more effective? We have a rather large pentagon budget, larger than most of the other countries in the world that have armies, navys and air forces all added together -- 

[00:22:48]


>> combined. 
>> And we should have a strong military. We ought to keep the canadians on their side of the border, make sure nobody can throw a punch at us successfully. But to argue we can't reform some of the pension questions and contracting decisions that are made and the good news is the republican caucus, the conservative caucus among republicans, the republican study committee leader jim jordan made the comment that while he was concerned about how the sequester might affect defense, he was more concerned that those cuts might not take place. That was part of a strong america is not to have this massive spending that we've been having. 
>> I'll have you on for another discussion about your concerns for the canadian invasion on another broadcast. 
>> We have to keep an eye on it. 
>> I'm glad you raised the issue. We haven't had enough of this. 
>> You see? 
>> Senator hillary clinton spending another night in the hospital as doctors are treating that blood clot in her head. We're going to talk to dr.

[00:27:30]


>>> Here's the last-minute debate on the house floor. House members having their final say before voting on the fiscal cliff bill. Let's take a quick look at some of the comments. 
>> Should be applied to any and all bills that we consider in this house. Compromise is not the art of perfection. By its very definition a compromise contains elements that neither side likes. But it also contains pieces both sides can embrace. What we will do tonight is not only adopt a piece of legislation that will give literally tens of millions of americans the ashaurns that 
-- assurance that their taxes will not be raised, millions of small businesses that their taxes will not be raised, millions of people who through no fault of their own are struggling to find a job and try to keep bread on their table, the assurance that we will be there to help. Tonight we will come together and do something else. With 37 1/2 hours left to go in the 112th congress, we will display to all of our constituents that, yes, in the final analysis -- 
>> the vote is expected to take place within the next half hour. We obviously are going to bring all of this to you live. Our coverage of that will continue. We want to take a look at secretary of state hillary clinton's health. I talked to dr. Sanjay gupta. Let's take a look. A blood clot in the head sounds very serious. 

[00:29:39]


>> The big distinction is this clot inside a blood vessel or it is not? That's the first question that doctors are going to ask. If it's outside the blood vessel meaning the bled vessel has ruptured and you're accumulating blood outside the vessel, that's a bigger problem. On this model, let's say you have a blood clot on top of the brain and putting pressure on the brain, that would obviously be a problem and something maybe that would require surgery. You don't want to give blood thinner. That would make that problem worse and burn a bridge in terms of possibly performing surgery should she need it. In her case, she actually has a blood clot inside one of the blood vessels that's in a vein that drains blood away from the brain. You can see this blue area in here, those are veins. These veins take blood away from the brain. In her case is on the left side, but on this model, right about here, a clot is in this area. Think about this, you have blood going to the brain. That same blood has to leave. If it's not leaving, the pressure builds up in the brain and that's what doctors are concerned about. It could lead to a stroke or other problems. 
>> I misspoke. I said '88, I believe it was '98 when she had the blood clot before. How are they treating it? They're giving her blood thinners now. 
>> The blood clot will dissolve and it will open up and allow the blood to drain. That can take some time. The issue you bring up about the blood clot in '98, it gives doctors the idea that she will be this person that is more likely to form clots. 
>> Why are some people more likely? 
>> We're constantly in state of clotting and not clotting in our body. You're doing right now, I'm doing right now. Some people tips toward more clotting. 
>> Clotting is -- 
>> forming blood clots. The blood is constantly clotting. Like if you cut yourself -- 
>> like a grouping of hardened blood or something? 
>> If you cut yourself, you notice a clot that forms around the cut. Same kind of thing except that it's happening inside the blood vessel. She may be someone who is more likely to clot. She may need to be on the blood thinners. 
>> If that doesn't work? 
>> That's a very interesting question, anderson. They do want to open up this particular blood vessel. What you may need to do if the blood thinners aren't working, put a little catheter, literally thread it up in the brain. An extraordinary procedure. You go in an area from the leg. 

[00:31:45]


>> From the leg through to the head. 
>> Threading it up. 
>> Why do you have to go so far? 
>> This is a blood vessel that you can access easily. You have to find a place to get into the body easily and safely. You can thread it up and put some medication right on the clot directly. 
>> That's crazy that they can do that. That's amazing. 
>> If that doesn't work, sometimes they'll literally take this corkscrew type device, put it into the clot and then pull the clot out of the body. A pretty extraordinary thing. Thankfully you don't have to do it very often. This problem we're describing in general is a pretty rare thing. 
>> Is that a risky thing, though? Putting that thing in -- 
>> it is risky. A challenging procedure and it's risky because this vein that I'm describing, it's a thin-walled structure. 
>> How much room are we talking about? Thousand -- how thin are these? 
>> The blood vessel itself is really tiny but the wall is like a piece of cheese. You don't want to cut it or open it up in some way because that would cause more bleeding. 
>> When you're threading, how do you not poke through the wall? 
>> You're literally threading this and watching this monitor simultaneously and guiding it by watching the monitor. 
>> That's incredible. 
>> People train for years to do that kind of thing. 
>> We obviously wish her the best. Sanjay, thank you very much. Amazing. 
>>> A look at the other stories we're following. Isha is here. 
>> A new year's eve celebration turning to tragedy in the ivory coast. A stampede following a fireworks show killed 60 people, many women and children. The country's president calling for three days of mourning and a speedy investigation. 
>>> North korean leader kim jong un talking about ending confrontation with south korea. He spoke about the importance of reuniting the two countrieand criticized the hostile policies of what he called anti-reunification forces in the south. 
>>> A flight struck another plane after landing at ft. Lauderdale hollywood international airport. The plane carrying 162 passengers was taxiing when its wing hit the tail of an empty plane parked overnight. Spirit airlines says no one was hurt. 

[00:33:56]


>>> Anderson, look at this. A wild scene caught on tape in new zealand. A fisherman reeling in a small shark when his cash suddenly becomes bait for an even larger shark. It attacked, chomping down and triggering a tug of war with the fisherman. I would have said, you can have it. 
>> Amazing stuff. 
>> Up next, we're going to go back to washington where the house is getty ready to vote on the fiscal cliff bill. EVEN WHEN WE CROSS OUR t's AND DOT OUR I's, We still run into problems. Namely, other humans. Which is why at liberty mutual insurance, auto policies come with new car replacement and accident forgiveness if you qualify. See what else comes standard at libertymutual.Com. Liberty mutual insurance. Responsibility. What's your policy? 

[00:38:00]


>>> We're continuing our breaking news coverage as the house gets ready to vote on a tax bill to haul the country back up the fiscal cliff, at least part way back up the cliff for now. It makes the bush tax cuts permanent for 98% of americans and raises taxes for the rest. By day's end the house leadership steered things back to a straight up-or-down vote on the senate version, which could come at any moment. Dana bash and jessica yellin have been following this if feels like for years now. Dana, what is the latest on capitol hill? The vote is, what, minutes away? 
>> Probably minutes away. If you look at the house floor right now, dave camp, the chairman of thf house ways and means committee is speaking. He is supposed to be the final speaker before we see this vote. Hopefully it's not too far away. It has been sort of something that we don't see very much on the floor of us house, which is you have been hearing democrats and republican speaking in support of something and something that is not just passing a post office, it's something that has real consequence and it really has to do with very different positions when it comes to their philosophies on the economy. 
>> And, jessica, in terms of from the white house, what are you hearing? 
>> Well, they've been watching this all night as closely as we have, anderson, and waiting for final passage. They've been optimistic all day that this would happen but they just want that last vote so they can breathe a sigh of relief. We are waiting to see whether the president will come out and make a statement. It would be our expectation that something that he would be inclined to do. This would be seen as a victory by him. If not, I would expect something on paper from the president. Both the president and vice president biden were involved in these negotiations the last few days. Vice president biden directly on the phone with senate minority LEADER mitch McConnell, 12:45 a.M. One night and pow-wowing with the president in the oval office until 2 a.M. With his team and up again at 7 a.M. This has been a white house to capitol hill negotiation and then back and for the. So everybody here will be very relieved when this is done for the nation and for their own to move on to the next agenda. We'll see whether the president goes on to hawaii from here, anderson. 

[00:40:33]


>> Dana, is the vote about to start now? 
>> That's exactly what I'm looking at. I can see it but not hear it to be honest with you. I'm right off the house floor and looking at a monitor here. Looks like it's going to start potentially at any minute. 
>> This is a 15-minute vote. 
>> Yup, that's answer to your quesyes. This is the big vote on the bill the senate passed. We should remind people that by a hugh amongous -- humongous margin voted. 
>> And we've already seen reactions in markets in asia. 
>> Yes, the hong kong market is up right now. Number one, while we were fighting about whether people who earn more than $400,000 should see a 4.6% increase in their income, everybody loses 2% on your next paycheck. There was the payroll tax holiday. I don't hear anybody -- I didn't hear anybody, republicans or democrats, fighting for the average american who is going to see 2% less in their check. Number two, the s&p 500, many of YOU WILL HAVE A 401(k) THAT Looks like the s&p 500, particularly if you're lazy and don't mix it up, it was up 15%. It closed the year up 13.4% because of this nonsense. So they cost you. If you have $100,000 saved up, it cost you a few thousand bucks that now won't multiply over the next 15, 20 years you work. This has cost americans a lot of money because of this. 
>> Let's go to dana bash. What are you hearing? 
>> You can probably see people walking by. Just a second ago the house speaker walked from his office, which is right down the hall here to the house floor. I asked how he was feeling and he just sort of looked down, was sort of a half smile, have smirk saying good. Don't think had the best day but he's certainly going to have a relief tonight after this vote it done. 

[00:42:41]


>> What is the number. We should be looking for in terms of vote tally to get this passed? 
>> We believe the number we should be looking for and if you see the bottom of the screen, the total is 80. The number we should be looking for is 217. Generally if there are no vacancies, the majority of the house is 218 but there are vacancies. We're looking at 217 for the magic number for this to pass. 
>> There had been some talk of voting, adding amendments to the senate bill but they didn't have the votes for that, the republicans. 
>> Correct. That's not happening. They say that they didn't have the votes for that. The way that they -- their strategy in order to make this happen, we're talking about boehner and his fellow house republican leaders, was to say they were going to go around and ask republicans in their caucus whether or not they would be for voting for this amendment, knowing it could throw this whole thing into turmoil because the senate probably wouldn't take it up and then they came back pretty quickly saying we don't think that there is the support so we're just going to ga g ahead and vote for the senate bill straight up or down. It was an intentional and very interesting strategy that they decided do that, allowing everybody to say their piece, to have a potential bill to answer some of their concerns, the biggest of which is that there aren't enough spending cuts in here but in the end they shoved it aside and decided to tight again another day. 
>> We're jd by charles blow and margaret hoover. Does anybody come out of this looking good on capitol hill in. 
>> I don't think so. I think this confirms what the public thinks about congress, which is that it is broken. And, you know, it's even vord 
-- extraordinary for us to be sitting here as if it's a suspenseful thing -- 
>> this is not a natural disaster. This is a man-made cliff. 
>> They made it to force themselves to do something that they ended up not doing and then they wait until the very last minute and somebody is going to come out of this and say we won and people are going to try to pat them on the back. It's like patting your teen-ager on the back for taking a shower. No, you're supposed to do that actually. We don't actually have to celebrate that. 

[00:44:58]


>> It's governance. 
>> It's what you're sent to washington to do. They're failing at that basic fundamental part of their job. 
>> It's interesting, listening to grover norquist, margaret, he paints this as a situation where you have diametrically opposed sides and there's no way any kind of compromise is possible because you have people of strong principle on both sides who are just tugging in different directions. Is that how you see it? Hasn't washington always been like that? 
>> Well, look, the one thing we're ignoring is the unsung heros are joe biden and mitch McCONNELL, WHO WERE ABLE TO Collaborate and get a deal done. They weren't even called in until the 11th hour. They got us across the finish line. They deserve a lot of credit here. I think they are the people who come out smelling pretty good and frankly should be called in tomorrow to start working on the next deal six weeks from now and I think, frankly, that was the secret sauce. They were the magic thing that was different in this. 
>> What was the strategy of not having some sort of a grand bargain? Just couldn't do it? 
>> When you take this to the world I normally operate in, the world of business, you put a poison pill in to avoid a bad thing from happening and most thinking people april void the poison pill. Congress, it's like it's candy, it's like let's take the poison pill. What grover said I don't believe to be true. He said liberals believe in bigger government and high taxes. I'm not sure that there are really sure there are people who believe in higher taxes. The issue is we've drawn those lines and have to become an either or. We have very few competitive districts left in this country and too many elections, too much money going into elections beep have citizens united, which has spoiled -- margaret is not agreeing with me on this but i think it's damaged the ability to have fair campaign. 
>> Boehner just voted yes. 

[00:46:59]


>> He actually comes out looking better. Every other country has this major industrialized nation has the same degree of good and bad governance and they do a lot less complication and a lot less money than we do. The money is really poisoning the system here. Grover norquist is a lobbyist. 
>> For as much as the money may be influencing the system, it didn't influence the outcomes. The side that spent the most money didn't win this election. Just for the record. Just for the record, though. That's my point. 
>> But they've mess thundershower up. They've cost them the 2.5% in THEIR 401(k)s, THE 2% IN THEIR Payroll tax. To save people who earn more than a million dollars a year not to pay higher taxes. 
>> Just because they didn't win the presidential election, it's not really the barometer we should be using on this. Weep should be using whether or not, you know that, kind of money can swoop into a local race or a congressional district where people do not have millions and millions of dollars and they can dump a few million and completely alter the contours -- 
>> with absolutely full transparency. So voters take that knowledge to the voting booth. They decide do they want sheldon addelson picking their candidate or not? Honestly, we can debate any time but this is -- 
>> put aside citizens united. Look at grover norquist who likes to is a pledge to constituents. My constituents don't have $10 million to drop on a campaign when something goes wrong. Grover norquist does provided by karl rove and his pac and the koch brothers and their pacs. It's like the nra saying they're a membership organization. That's what grover norquist is doing. No, it's not. It's a lobby group with a lot of money mant to preserve special interests for people. That has a lot of influence on what going on with these congressmen. 

[00:49:04]


>> You're right, it does have an influence -- 
>> also it's the house where they're running every two years so they're in a constant state of running, in constant fear of a primary battle. In the senate they have six years, they're able to look a little bit more long term. 
>> A few thousand bucks means a lot in a haus race. When grover has $10 million, that's a lot of influence. He's not just a regular guy. I love the way he paints himself as just another guy who doesn't want tax increases. That's just not true. 
>> In terms of the next battle -- 
>> the debt crisis. That will be within a month. That's a big problem because unlike this where I can give you abstracts as to how it affects the economy, if we don't extend the debt limit, the government shuts down. That's going to be feel much more urgent. This has a much bigger influence on the united states and the global economy. 
>> How do you think markets will react tomorrow, u.S. Markets? 
>> At the moment if this passes in the next five minutes, we'll be fine. Asian markets are doing quite well on this news. 
>> But the markets will freak out, right? 
>> At some point -- it cost the u.S.1.7 to borrow for ten years, better than any mortgage than anyone can get. That's because europe is in such bad shape. But europe is starting to get its act together. And people will shift their money away. It's not going to be overnight, not going to be massive, not going to be terrible burr everything will become more expensive, including our debt, our mortgages and our car loans. 
>> I know you have to go down to another set. We'll say good-bye to you and we'll see ali ten minutes from now. Even though we expect the vote to occur within ten minutes, our coverage will continue. There's a lot more to talk about in the next hour. I want to bring you dana bash. Hough does john boehner come out of all of this? 
>> Something interesting just happened. Dierdre walsh is telling us she's watching how members are voting, she reports that john boehner, the house speaker, voted yes. That's significant for two reasons. One is it is the tradition that speakers do not usually vote and they only vote when they want to make a point. They want to make a point whether it is nancy pelosi voting on health care or in this particular case, when hopefully we can talk to john boehner and ask him himself, but it seems to be that he wants to make the point that he understands what these democrats were tal about on the floor, that compromise isn't easy and you don't always get what you want and you have to vote for the best deal that you can, particularly when you're talking about something that really affects americans' pocketbooks. I think it was really significant that the house speaker voted and voted yes for this deal. I also just want to give our viewers an update of where we are in this vote tally. So far 153, as you said. We believe 217, it depends on how many people are voting. That would be the high threshold. The other thing I want to point out is the split ame parties, that you can see there on the screen. So far 99 democrats have voted yes and 57 republicans have voted yes. So definitely is the kind of bipartisan split we anticipated to happen. But we still see there are still 172 members that have not yet voted. 

[00:52:28]


>> We had trent lott on the program recently and george mitchell. They were dekraaiing the state of capitol hill today where compromise is a dirty word and, you know, they were saying, looking we had tough battles back then but both sides talked to each other. You don't see that happening now. When did that change? Why did that occur? 
>> I think part what we were talking about before, which is that the republicans get primaried more, part of it is the never-ending campaign cycles where you have a tremendous amount of money. Part it have is also what we're doing here, 24-hour news, it is social media, it is people tracking every minute of everything that everybody says to point where if you are out of line, you get called on it immediately. When you are able to -- when you are able to have conversations and go back and forth and change your mind a little bit from day to day and no one was tracking that every minute that you were doing that, I think it was a little easier to govern. 
>> It does seem like politicians are playing to those cameras a lot who are than they had the ability to back then or playing to twitter because they're out in front of cameras. 
>> And who's on twitter? Who's on twitter that's their constituent? If they have votes only four days a week, they go home on thursday. They spend just as much time almost in washington as they do with their constituents and with their families, which on the one hand is quite good, representing the will of their constituents. On the flip side, they're not spending time with each over, not getting to know each other as people, their kids aren't going to soccer games together, wives and spouses aren't social sizing and the camaraderie has really disintegrated in many ways. 
>> Jessica yellin is also joining us from the white house. From the white house perspective, jessica, what happens tomorrow? Margaret was saying joe biden should be down there on capitol hill working on the next one. Does he continue to be involved or was that a last-minute hail mary maneuver? 

[00:54:34]


>> No, the vice president has longstanding relationships that are always in use up here. But I think the white house is prepared to pivot very quickly into the next battle and that's both the battle over the debt ceiling and over the post pointment of these guaranteed deficit cuts, called a sequester. There's $1 trillion left on that and that will come due march 2nd, TWO MONTHS FROM THE DAY This passes. So that will happen right around the same time as the debt ceiling. So we turn around and head into another huge titanic battle over although issues. I think it will take all the power and mite that the vice president has and the president's popularity and his second term mandate, if he has one at this point, to do that. I do think he has a mandate and some capital right now to spend but he's going to have to spend it in this fight. 
>> To jessica's point, I mean, he has actually a very full plate of things he wants to get done. He wants to do immigration, he wants to do gun control. These are huge issues that take a lot of political capital to get over the finish line and instead he has to be haggling over the next debt ceiling crisis and the budget and fiscal issues. Jessica raises a very strong conundrum the president is facing. How is he going to handing -- 
>> it's not just him, though. This is going forward, not just obama, but the next president and the next congress. This is kind of the way -- we're kind of stuck -- mired in this -- this is the way it's working now. This is is not just about what obama's mandate or agenda might be but what is the next pred going to do when you run pen that is able to exert so much influence and just basically stop everything from working, which is what has happened and that means that the next group in the minority will also do the same thing. They've kind of demonsated that it works. 

[00:56:43]


>> Maybe. Maybe. But there is this alternative perspective that this is a very bad alchemy of negotiating table right now. Thousand the combination and -- 
>> I just have to interrupt. The bill just passed. Dana, it's passed for sure? 
>> Reporter: That's right. If we're looking at the screen now,as itted with some wiggle room, 223 and there are still 56 members who still haven't voted. I think that's noteworthy. But also noteworthy again is to look at the party split of how this vote is so far. Republicans 76, yes; democrats 149, yes. We were told earlier in the day that the democrats thought they would deliver the majority of these votes and it looks like that's e way it's going. 144 republican so far have said we're not going to sign on to that. Very different proportionally than what we saw in the senate in the early morning hours this morning where only five republicans voted against this deal. It is certainly noteworthy. This is done, it's passed and the next stop is the president's desk to sign it? 
>> How quickly does that occur? 
>> Depends. There are technical, procedural issues tone role it. Sometimes it might take a day. They can do it faster since we are talking about just hours until the markets open, particularly even before that internationalally but particularly in the united states. So there might be pressure that the president feels to do that but since markets move on sort of psychological issues, this is certainly a psych large call plus for them. They see that it's going to happen and it will pass overwhelmingly partisan. 

[00:58:52]


>> How quickly are we talking about in terms of pivoting to the next battle and on capitol hill? 
>> Oh, probably very, very fast. The next official battle will be now in two months, which is when the sequester or those mandatory spend p sbending bill they just passed delays them for two months. It's going to be the next battle. And the big one, which really matters for our economy, which is the u.S. Reaching its debt ceiling. I got to also say that of those now 82 republicans who are voting yes, many of them are doing it because they feel it is important to make sure that 98% of americans keep their tax cuts in place but also because tactically they see what's next is a vote or a debate where they believe they have leverage, which is on the debt ceiling. 
>> I appreciate your reporting. I noe it's been a colossal day, monumental task for are you

>> At union bank our relationship managers work hard to know your business offering specialized solutions in capital to help you meet your growth objectives. We offer expertise and tailored solutions for small businesses and major corporations. What can we do for you? 
>> A new year nightmare. 60 people killed in a stampede in a fireworks display in ivory coast. A deal to avert financial crisis hangs in the balance. Republicans in the u. House of representatives warn they can't now support it. Tens of thousands take to the streets in hong kong calling for a change of leadership and greater democracy. Pope benedict warns of the growing inequality between rich and poor and the extremes of capitalism. Where are all of these people running to in the first day of 2013? We will find out. Hello. Three days of mourning have been declared in ivory coast after a celebration turns into tragedy. At least 60 people were killed in a stampede at a fireworks display. Most of the victims were between 13-18. 

[00:02:24]


>> It started as a new year celebration of ivory coast recently restored peace after a long civil war. Something went horribly wrong. Near one of the entrances to the football stadium a crowd surged. Men, women and many children fell. Rescue workers reached the scene quickly. The tragedy occurred in the center. This fireman said they found people trampled and suffocated. The number of dead almost certainly will rise. People with life threatening head injuries have been admitted for treatment. The woman lying on the bed is six months pregnant. Her husband said she tried to move away from the crowd but because she was slower than most, she was trapped. The president of ivory coast visited the hospital and gave sympathy and promise to pay the medical bills of the wounded. But that won't be enough. The people of ivory coast will want to know why the security forces failed in their crowd control. They will want to know why, even as they were celebrating peace, the end of war, danger and death returned. Mark doyle, bbc news. 
>> A west africa correspondent told us how the authorities are handling the investigation. 
>> The president confirmed when he visited the hospital today an investigation was underway to understand what happened. And I think that the people will hope that a swift investigation to answer the questions over the incidents. There are different theories that are emerging from eyewitnesses that we have been able to talk to. Some say that a group of youths were brandishing knives and mugging people and snatching people's mobile phone and that provoked a panic at the back of the cwds. Others say that security forces were trying to control the many thousands who were walking through the city center at the end of the fireworks event and that is what triggered the stampede. So, it is all unclear for now and the people are waiting for answers. 

[00:04:52]


>> What is the safety record of large gathering in ivory coast. Presumably nothing on this scale happened before. 
>> This is the biggest stampede in the last year at least. And the security forces were, you know, once known as one of the best on the continent. Over the past decade with the conflict, the security forces have been going through tremendous hard times. And in fact they need to be rebuilt. But there was such events that took place two years ago at the end of a football match but not the scale of this stampede this year. 
>> And bitter irony of this, those celebrating the new year were at the end of a traumatic period of war for the country. 
>> Exactly. This is very hard for ivory coast on the same night people were watching on television and very hopeful and optimistic message from their president. The fireworks event was a happy event. This terrible ending prompted the president to declare three days of mourning to start the year with. Deal to end the american budget crisis has come into doubt. The so called fiscal cliff but the deal still needs approval in the lower house of representatives and it is there that the debate continues. 
>> In new york's times square the clock ticked down to midnot, not just to the beginning of the new year but a deal to avoid catastrophic tax rises and spending cuts. Few here are engaged by economics but failure could be an unhappy and unlucky 2013. The senate missed the deadlin by hours but they did vote on a deal put together by the vice president joe biden, better late than never they backed the compromise. 

[00:07:19]


>> The bill as amended is passed. 
>> The republican leader defended his deal with the democrats. 
>> It took an imperfect deal to prevent a real financial pain. But in my view twas worth the effort. 
>> The deal he is talking about would mean a higher tax rate for families earning more than $450,000 a year, fewer than 1% of americans. Unemployment benefits for 2 million americans would be extended and more than $100 billion worth of spending cuts would be delayed two months. The republican dominated house of representatives yet to give their verdict on the deal. If it did give a thumbs down it would be back to the severe tax rises and spending cuts. Doesn't matter yet because it is a public holiday and the markets are closed so they have a little time but not much. Many republicans are outraged that it does not deal with the fundamental problem, too much spending. 
>> We are taking up a bill that won't do anything to cut spending. I am embarrassed for this generation. The future generations deserve better. 
>> If the house kills the bill the widespread contempt for congress will only grow. 
>> To have negotiated at this level of detail to come so close to the goal line and not be able to go over it. 
>> Wall street is desserted today. But when the markets return from their holiday their reaction to the spectacle of american democracy in action will be critically important. How shake sethis deal looking? 
>> I think it is pretty shaky at the moment. The republicans in the house of representatives announced in 10 minutes time they will hold a meeting or a conference call to decide what to do next. The position is that the number two republican has said he can't back this deal. Not unless there are big changes making cuts in spending. The republican leader, we don't know. John boehner hasn't said whether he will bring it to a vote or try to make changes and spend it off to the senate again. This deal that everybody says is so important for the world's economy and not just america is in peril tonight. 

[00:09:50]


>> But if the deal does fall down do they go right back to square 1? How long can it go on for? 
>> Well it is able to go on without damaging the american economy. Technically america is already over the fiscal cliff. Technically there are tax rises and spending cuts brought in. That hasn't happened because it is a public holiday right now. So, that would come into effect. You are right. They are running out of time. There is a new congress on thursday. Anything that is still up in the air if not resolved by then it will fall and they will have to go back to the drawing board. In the end there will be a deal. But while the uncertainty continues it will hurt the american economy. 
>> Thanks. Fierce clashes have erupted as rebels targeted the airport which is now closed to limit the movement of government forces. The syrian army has been surrounding areas after what they described as clashes with armed terrorist group. The iranian navy tested ship missiles in a drill iran warned off foreign surveillance planes that tried to approach their forces during the drill. People in athens started their new year without metro or train services as workers go on strike. They oppose further cuts and their inclusions in the single payroll. Seven charity workers, six women have been killed in a drive by shooting in northwest pakistan. Police say they were shot dead by gunmen on motorbikes. All of the victims are said to be pakistani citizens. 

[00:12:10]


>> Unfortunately aide workers have been targeted in the past. Health workers, nine of them were shot done. They have all been involved in pakistan's polio vaccination drive. At that time they did not say they carried out the attacks but they have been spreading rumors and suspicions for many years now saying that somehow these health workers are working for a western agenda by gathering intelligence or sterilizing muse limb children. There were seven workers all working at this children's community center that just finished a shift, they were getting into their van and driving off. It was sprayed with bullets. Of them were women teach ares, two of them were health workers. 
>> At least two people have been killed in a port city. Police say another 50 were wounded. Reports suggest the bomb was planted on a motorcycle in a crowded area and exploded by remote control. And staying in pakistan u.N. Health workers say a record number of children died from measles related causes in 2012. Just over 300 children died. Pakistani health authorities in the worst affected area. Still to come a bracing start to the new year with a bit of north sea madness. 

[00:14:16]


>> Once again they called for weapons and aide. 
>> I am sure that our revolution will continue to get more and more. Also I hope the international community will recognize exactly what happened in syria and do his duty to help our people in humanitarian and help them to defend themselves by providing weapons to free people seeking freedom and dignity. 
>> You are watching bbc world news. Let's take you through the headlines. The president of ivory coast visits the hospital where the injured were taken after a stampede at new years celebrations in which 60 people were killed. Republicans in the u.S. House of representatives say they are not ready to support a deal that aims to avert a budget crisis. Thousands of people have been expressing their fury in a city where space is highly prized and priced they claimed he lie body illegal construction at his home. The -- the report contains flash photography. 
>> This is how anti-government protesters in hong kong see their leader. They say he can no longer be trusted to run the island with 7 million people calli home. Thousands march through the city in what was an auspicious start to 2013 for the territory demanding the resignation of the chief executive who they see as a pickup tote beijing. 

[00:16:36]


>> Your credibility decides whether the public should support you or not. If you don't have credibility you will lose the confidence of the public. 
>> If the government lacks integrity how can they have authority to govern hong kong. We must take to the streets and make our voices heard. For the people living here their way of life is influenced by the west and had been for over a century. Doncht those on the mainland. So the chinese leadership agreed to keep hong kong but overseeing it all would be a leader backed by beijing. Today that leader elected by a committee loyal to china's central government is under increasing pressure to give up his post. Protesters clashed with police after a relatively peaceful day of demonstrations. Whatever their issue is with the current leadership it is outweighed by their desire for democracy. We have been asking for more than 20 years. 
>> China promised that this will happen in 2017. Until then the issue of how the territory is governed remains deeply guided. 
>> We were reporting earlier on the awful story from ivory coast, 60 people killed in a stampede in a new years celebration. Now from angola. There are report on the rueters news agency quoting the state news agency that 10 people have been crushed to death and 120 injured in the capitol of rwanda as they tried to enter an overcrowded stadium for a pentecostal church. The agency goes on to say that the emergency services say the victims include four children who were crushed in the gates of the stadium where this church had organized a vigil on monday night. So, that is the report from angola. 10 people are crushed to death and 120 injured as they tried to enter an overcrowded stadium. Back now to the talks taking place in the u.S. Hoping to divert the country from possible recession. Professor of business now at the university of maryland. He said he was not surprised an agreement hasn't been made. 

[00:19:29]


>> It accomplishes none of the republicans objectives. Speak of boehner's plan b, accomplished more of their objectives and increased taxes less than this compromise in the senate. The senate majority leader, mr. Mcconnell said we will have tax increases now but we will get the spending cuts later. He reminded me of a character from popeye in wimpy. If you give me a hamburger today I will gladly pay you on tuesday. Tuesday never comes with spending cuts. The country is on an unsustainable spending pass. You know maybe they need to make their stand now. 
>> Explain what happens then if the deal does not go through. We heard all about the deadline. First of all the midnight deadline and now a looming deadline as the financial markets opening. What happens without a deal? 
>> The financial market deadline is for no one. What really matters is the economic activity in the u.S. Economy and whether things stall. If we go off the cliff and stay there the economy will stall and have a recession. But if not we will slog along at 2% growth, perhaps less now with these tax increases falling heavily on small businesses. As a consequence we are headed by the end of mr. Obama's term or the term of the next president for the kind of situation, not so much that greece is in but that italy is in. Unsustainable debt. Draconian budget cuts instead of reasonable ones now. Unable to meet the commitments to the elderly and needy. We are spending ourselves broke right now. 
>> In his new years message pope benedict condemned unregulated capitalism. The pope thanks the world's peacemakers saying that. 

[00:21:35]


>> The 85-year-old pope rang in the new year by celebrating mass and preaching to a congregation of thousands. The catholic church marks the beginning of each new year as world peace day. Hunger for peace, a universal longing was the dominant theme of this year's message. Pope benedict deplored growing inequality between rich and poorer people. What he called the prevalence of a selfish mind set expressed by unregulated capitalism. He thanked the world's peacemakers for their efforts. They deserve praise he said for working tirelessly, often behind the scenes. I am convinced many works of peace that are abundant in the world testified to humanity's deep lodging for peace. 
>> Thousands of peace marchers arrived releasing balloons. The catholic church's social teaching is something the pope cares about a lot. In a separate message pope benedict called for the ethical regulation of markets. The global financial crisis he argues it is proof that capitalism fails to protect the weakest members of society. As pope benedict interests the eighth year his frail health is more obvious. He frequently walks with a cane. He has no confirmed travel plans for 2013. 
>> A british tourist has been shot dead as he danced in a new year's party in one of thailand's most famous island. The 22-year-old was caught in cross fire between local gangs. The island draws thousands of backpackers to the famous full moon party. His family has been told. The thai authorities supply medicine, food and water to those on board saying they have been drifting in the sea for 13 days trying to reach malaysia where around 25,000. In his first new year the reformist president of burma has said the world has been amazed by burma's political progress last year and expectations have soared but he urged the people to be patient. He said they still have many aspects to perform and that widespread change takes time. How have you been spending the first day of 2013 on a sofa or stroll in the park? How about this though. Tens of thousands of people in various parts of europe have been taking the opportunity to jump into freezing cold water. 

[00:24:44]


>> It is a tradition that dates back a decade. This year in the dutch seaside down 10,000 took the plunge. Temperatures in the north seawright now around 8 degrees celsius. Most people watching it will have one question. Why. 
>> It is how I start the year fresh like this, just to forget your worries. It was just wonderful. 
>> You start the new year with a refreshingly new profile picture. This is the new year's plunge. Italian style. In rome they flocked to the ancient river after a turbulent 2012 and hope the future holds more favorable condition. In germany a sparkling stream of swimmers going into the lake on the outskirts of berlin. Those brave enough to take the plunge are passionate about the benefits. 
>> Wonderful. Really refreshing. Beautiful. A really good start for the new year.

ngitual ever. Okay, bye. Bye. Okay. (singsongy): Who wants bagels?! I do! My name is Kate. You got more bagels? What is this, Yom Kipp? Bj: She's inventing reasons to go out so she can bump into Will. She's taking it slow. It's a plan she calls "Operation..." Both: ...Crock-Pot." You cook it slow. You flirt a little bit here, you flirt a little bit there, and then three months later, boom, it's done. I'm ready to eat. It's delicious. I don't know about this guy. He's too, like, Captain America. Like, "Oh, I got a square jaw." "I've got white, perfect teeth. You know, they're straight." Can't trust a guy like that. No, I feel like I need to do some recon on the guy. See if he's worthy of the Fox name. I mean, he would obviously be taking your name, right? No recon, okay? He's a really good guy. And he's super sensitive. On Halloween, when I met him, he practically cried in front of me I could cry on Halloween. I could cry right now. Go on. Cry. Cry right now. Fine. Okay, the death of jazz, Iron Giant, (voice breaks): the possibility of Iron Giant II. The story about the elephant, you know, who forms an unlikely friendship with a little dog. Okay, starting over. Mrs. West wanted me to remind you about Career Day. Oh, did she? er Day? What? Where moms and dads come to class and talk about their careers. Thank you. I can read. Wait. You didn't ask me 'cause I'm not your dad? No, because you don't have a career. Wow. (laughing) (sniffling) Bj: What? Sorry. I was just thinking about the... the dog and the elephant and how they're friends, and it's just, it's really sweet because one's so big, the other one's so little. And, like, really unexpected because... 'cause of the different sizes. Sorry. 
??? Wake up, look around    There's a feeling today   

[00:02:01]


  Fall down, get up again     Get in the game     Hey, hey, hey     We're all here anyway.  ??????
All right, so th is my competition for Career Day, huh? I can totally take these guys. What's that guy do? He's a pilot. Oh, well, that's not fair. I mean, that's awesome. What about this one? What's this dad do? He has a landscaping business. Slash? That's it. That's it? No landscaper/ herbalist/mushroom hunter? You don't have to come to Career Day. You can come to the ice cream social. Is that all I am to you, just someone to be social with over a frozen dessert? No, I will be at that Career Day, Maddie, okay, with a career and everything, I promise you. It's in two days. No problem. But, you know, definitely put me down for that ice cream thing, ok Plus two. Ooh, ooh, ooh, I got to do some recon for your mom. Go, uh, find a book or something. Hey, Will! Willy! Bill! Billiam! Hey. Kate's brother, right? Yeah, man. Hey. This is my daughter Shelley. Ah, hi, Shelley. That's an awesome name. That's also an awesome backpack. Yeah, big fan of bumblebees and flowers. And purple. (chuckles) So what kind of stuff are you into, bro? I really like where Will and I are at-- the simmering stage. You , the lid is on, the carrots are softening. Hey, Kenny. Hello. Did you see that? See what? Oh, that face! No. Since I got the raise, he has been giving me a lot of attitude. Maybe that's because you're late every day. And you also don't actually ever do any real work when you're here. And you just started sleeping with the boss. And now you. You don't think that I should maybe, like, turn the heat up on Operation Crock-Pot? How long has it been since you had sex? Couple months. How many? 57. You see, Maddie, every great entrepreneur keeps a list of potential business ideas for the moment when his niece springs Career Day on him at the last minute. All right, what do we got, Tommy? Number one: Revive the American railroad industry. Such a rock-solid idea. Probably bigger than a two-day thing, though. 

[00:04:01]


Two: Biodegradable cell phones. I like that idea. Why didn't we put a pin in that? We were unable to create a prototype that made or received phone calls. Okay, okay, that makes sense. Three: Get the 200 crates of wine from underground storage and sell it to the finest bistros. Ooh. Wait, what crates of wine? You remember, summer of '95? I had the tan of my life working on that vineyard in the south of Frce? Ah, Veronique. Who's Veronique? She, uh... she was a woman friend of mine. A French woman, if you must know. And we made wine together. After her husband died... later, to be determined by natural causes, obviously, Yeah. she sent me crates of wine as a reminder of our time together. You know, this might be worth something. The ladies down at the country club are always talking about "wine o'clock." This is a good idea. This is a really... I like the way this feels, Tommy, you know? I could see us in the spirits game. Is that where you hunt ghosts? (chuckles) Get out. I'm serious. Get out of here. Youget out of here. It's like she's not even listening. (glass breaks) Where did this come from? And don't say you found it, because I will not testify on your behalf. Hello. Ben Fox, local wine merchant. Wine merchant? Dude, don't let Maddie's thing get in your head, okay? Nothing's in my head. I'm excited by it, you know? Will thought it was a good idea, too. Will? Yeah, I talked to him. You know, just suss him out just like we talked about. No, that's not what... I specifically said no sussing. Do not suss. Relax, okay? He seems like a good guy so far. But I need to see the two of you guys together. Absolutely not under any circumstances ever. Hypothetically. Okay, let's just say, you know, he came over with some ground beef, you know, and I added my signature blend of spices and we threw it on the grill and the three of us, you know, spend some quality time together. No, that sounds like the worst thing in the world. Okay, sort of starting to think that maybe you're not into the hypothetical. No. So what if it was happening in real time? Will: Oh, hey, Kate. Hey! I got the grill going. Will's here! Yay!

Did I buy way too much meat? I thought there was gonna be more people. Oh, yeah, no, no. There's a ton of neighbors coming to this impromptu nighttime barbecue. Yeah, probably just running late, you (chuckles) Ever done any time, Will? KATE: Oh, my God, that is so funny. He means, like... like, "What's the craziest thing you've ever done?" You know, like a fun question to ask at parties. Me and my buddies went streaking in downtown San Antonio after our swim team won State. So, naked-naked swimmers in the street? Public indecency, yeah. Not off to a great start, Will. So what do you do when you're not flapping about? Well, I'm a social worker for at-risk youth. Slash...? That's it. Oh, sounds a lot like charity work. But good for you. Me, I am in the wine business. As of, like, an hour ago. And this haughty but accessible number goes by the name "Veronique." Hmm. Yeah, it's got flavors of cherry and cigar and bark. Bark? Yeah, hints. Here we go. Top you off. Cheers to, uh... to getting to know you. The real you. Eye contact? Ben, that's not... Shh... Hold it. Okay. Uh-huh. (slurping) I'm really sorry that nobody else showed up. I think everybody hates me. Or maybe it's because your brother invented a fake night barbecue just to get me over here. What?! Just saying. That's crazy. Only a complete lunatic would do something like that. h chuckle) Yeah, yeah, you're right. Everybody probably hates you. I'm glad I finally got a chance to hang out with you. Me, too. I'd love to take you out for a proper meal. Maybe tomorrow night? Yeah. Yes. That would be great. Yeah? I could be here by 7:00. Then that is when I will see you with my looking balls. Okay. Okay. Good night. Good night.

Kenny, I'm still waiting on the order for table five. Kenny, stop being a child. Kenny, Kenny, Kenny. Kenny! Kenny! Kenny-Kenny-Kenny- Kenny-Kenny-Kenny- Kenny-Kenny-Kenny-Kenny- Kenny-Kenny- Kenny-Kenny-Kenny-Kenny-Kenny- Kenny-Kenny-Kenny. (gasps) What? Skinned my shoulder! So, I have you down for zero cases of wine, and I will never call this number again. Okay, bye. Dude, this is ridiculous. You've called every wine bar in town and not a single appointment? This is a tough inry to break into especially if you're an unknown. t unlike our experiences with the clique-y world of meteorology. Oh! Dude, what are we gonna do? I mean, what's our move here? Maddie's Career Day is right on my ass. Want me to play the race card? I'll do it. I haven't played it in so long. I want to just get in somebody's face and be like, "Ah, you racist!" I can be a old black man: "Boy, now, my son came in there "and you turned him away 'cause his skin color. Let him get people drunk!" And I can be my uncle: "Hey, man, you better let my cousin, my nephew get in there and sell wine." No, I feel like we should hold onto it. (doorbell rings) Oh, boy. Look at you. You're the devil, you know that? All right, what do we got here? You know what? Just take all of it, you little pushers. Take all of it! Give me the cookies. Get out of here. Thanks again for childhood obesity. All right, where was I? Oh, right. How to sell wine without any contacts. We need to cut out the middleman. Exactly. We go straight to the buyer. Mm-hmm. You know, streamline it. Take it right to the people. It's like we're right on a precipice. Edge on over. We're right on the edge of something. I feel like we should... First of all, we got to leave the house. Knock on the door and say, "Hey, we have something to sell." All we have to do is start turning the knob slowly. First of all, we just head through the door and go inside the house. Customer's always right, no matter what. Now we're talking to people. That's right. That's the way you run a business. Mm-hmm. Both: That is the way you run a business. Mm-hmm. Oh, hi there. Is your mom here? (chuckles) I'm just kidding. I'm here for you, Mom. (doorbell rings) 

[00:12:14]


Who has time to take care of the kids, to Pilates, satisfy their husbands andgo to the store to buy wine? Right? Not me. I don't know about you, but as soon as my little one's off to school, I'm like, "Waiter!" (laughing) Yes. What's happening? What? Let's party. You know what I'm saying? Okay. In a strictly platonic way. How are you? My name is Ben Fox. Yeah. Just ignore him. (giggles) It's just become such a hostile envit, you know, at work. Now Kenny's turned the entire kitchen staff against me. I mean, have you ever actually had a conversation with any of these guys? ah, I see your point. Let's call this Operation Reputation Rehabilitation. Do we name too many operations? Yeah. Yeah? Man. Are you applying for an adjustable rate mortgage? I'll have you know that I am revolutionizing the adult beverage industry. I'm throwing a little wine tasting here tonight. Is that what you're wearing, or... (knocking on door) I'll get it. Ben, no! Kate... I'm just gonna shake the guy's hand. Okay? Nothing weird. You have my blessing, okay? I don't need your blessing. Well, too late. Already been blessed. Take it back, Ben. Can't unbless. Ben, stop. Blessed! Hey, Will. Ben. How are you? Good to see you. Is that what you're wearing? Kate: Here I come. Please stop talking. Okay. All right, well... Listen. Have a great time. Thanks. Yeah. Listen to me right now, okay? You take care of her. You treat her right. Okay? She's not as strong as she looks. She spooks easy, so she needs everything to be perfect. O-Okay. She's especially terrified of people leaving her, so if she even smells that on you, she will run, boy. Okay. She also hasn't been with anybody physically in a very long time. So there's gonna be a lot of pressure on that. I don't want any details, but just so you're aware of it. You got it? Kate: Ready? Okay. Great. Ready? Are you ready? Yeah, you bet. Have fun with my sister. You guys have a great time! Fasten your seat belts and no texting, okay? 

[00:14:14]


A lot of great people die horrifically that way. Kate: Thanks, Ben. SFX- "sounds of african drum and flute" Look who's back. Again? It's embarrassing It's embarrassing! We can see you Carl. We can totally see you. Come on you're better than this...all that prowling around. Yeah, you're the king of the jungle. Have you thought about going vegan Carl? Hahaha!! You know folks who save hundreds of dollars by switching to GEICO sure are happy. How happy are they Jimmy? Happier than antelope with night-vision goggles. Nice! Get happy. Get GEICO.

[00:18:14]


This is really fun. It's been a really long time since I've had, like, an actual adult night out. You knowYo Oh, I know. Yeah. Not that there's any pressure to make it adult. I mean, who's to say what "adult" means anyway? (chuckles) Would you excuse me for a second? I'm... I just got to run to the bathroom. Not that I'm running. "Run" is a bad choice of words. I'm-I'm not gonna really run anywhere. As a matter of fact, you know what? I'm gonna go ahead and... I'm gonna leave my watch. And, uh... and my wallet. Um... st hold onto that. I will be right back. Okay... Sometimes, I want a time-out. You know? Sometimes I want my mommy juice, and I don't want to feel bad about it. My secret weapon... voil??. (gasps) Wine-sicles. Cold, refreshing, alcoholic. Hey, Ron. Come pick me up. I'm at a tasting. Oh, Ben, you are so bad. (laughs) No more. Okay. Maybe a little more. (laughing) Oh! All right. Yeah, I'm drunk. You're fat. So what? Let me talk to him. Hey, bud. Not to worry. She's in good hands. Super manly hands. (laughing) Can I talk to you? One sec. (laughing): Oh, that was... Be careful of Joanne and Ron. The belong to the country club, and I've seen this game before. Oh, she's just a flirt. No harm, no foul. I don't know. I've seen her flirt with a lot of guys, get Ron hot under the collar, and then they have sex on the 15th green. 15th green? That's got a steep break to the right, doesn't it? Real steep. I think that's part of the thrill. Is your food okay? Because, if it's not exactly the way you like it, I can... I can flag somebody down without ever leaving the table. Are you okay? Yeah. Uh... Yeah, I'm sorry... I'm acting weird. It's just that I talked to your brother, and he-he told me that you... have some issues. I'm sorry, what? He said that you spook really easily, and that it's been a long while since you've... (high-pitched squeal) I am so... that's just so embarrassing. 

[00:20:15]


But also, that is... it's all true. It's completely true. Um... I do spook easily. I do. That's why I never called you after Halloween. And I'm just not gonna comment on the second half of that. What you said earlier. About the... (makes squeaky bedspring noises) So instead, you just... showed up at the bagel place, like, a million times so we'd run into one another? I just though it would be easier for me to just have a crush on you, and I didn't want it to become the thing where you'll just one day be my future ex-boyfriend. If we could just go back to something yout said. Um, what kind of crush are we talking about here? Like this, or like... Mmm... Bigger than that. No. Are we talking about a crush still? I think it's pointless. They all hate me. And for some inexplicable reason, it hurts my feelings. Mom says to be nice to mean people. I really wasn't expecting a back-and-forth, Maddie. Anlove your mum, but just so you know, in this particular issue, she doesn't really know what she's talking about. I know. You what? There's this boy in my class who won't stop teasing me. So I said I was going to come to his house and hurt him in his sleep. Yeah? And now he doesn't tease me anymore. Mom thinks it's because she talked to his mom, but... Will you keep an eye on her? Thanks. Mm-hmm. Bj: Hey! Guess what. I don't care what you think I did to get that raise. I deserved it. I am a decent person, but next time you want to bad-mouth me, you might not want to go to sleep at night, because while you're sleeping, you might lose a finger. Do you understand me, Kenny? Do... you... understand me, Kenny? Yes. Yes, yes! But my name... my name is not Kenny. What? My name's not Kenny. Your name is Kenny. My name is Sam. No, it's not. Yes, it is. That? That's Kenny. He's Kenny. You always call us the wrong names, every single day. Oh, that's... Oh, that's what 

[00:22:16]


the dirty looks... 'cause I was... yeah. I thought you were judging me, but I was just... it was the stupid names. When... I mean, we... Isn't that funny? Well, we all still judge you. Oh, shut up. Shut your face, Kenny Sam. (laughs) I can't believe it. I feel so much better. Yeah. Well... Night, Kenny, Sam. I love you guys. (whispering): You most. wish ipads... To practice math more? I love math! But two ipads means two data plans? That's crazy. Maybe not. With at&t mobile share, adding an ipad is just $10 a month. But honestly, mom and dad's love is all i really need. We should keep these for us. We should keep these. What?! [ Male Announcer ] AT&T MOBILE SHARE. Add an ipad for just $10 a month. One plan. Up to 10 devices. At&t. Rethink possible.

And don't be afraid to open a bottle of Veronique a couple of hours before serving. It only gets better with age. I know I don't need to tell you that, Cheryl. (laughing) You're beautiful. How merlot can we go? Tommy! I heard your sister was going out with that hot divorc?? from down the street. Well, depends on your definition of "hot." I find him to be too symmetrical. Eerily so. Is it hot to leave your wife? What? He left his wife? Yeah. Last year, at Christmas. I mean, not that I was surprised. How did your sister hook up with him anyway? Well, she just... she, uh... she... Me. I did this. You can't turn up a Crock-Pot. It's a slow-cooker. It's not meant for extreme heat. You know, you want the meat to fall off the bone, not get burnt. Mm-hmm. It's not your fault, honey. Look, marriage is a confining institution, but... Ben? Ben? Don't leave. Oh, so that's Ben? That's Mr. Wine Hands? You're pathetic. Oh, yeah. He's mad. (giggles) That wasn't bad for an adult night out. Well, let's see how our adult night in goes. Ooh... Get out of my sister! Oh, my God! Ben, what are you doing? Hey! Come here, you son of a bitch! Ben: Hey, listen, we're right in the middle of a family thing, okay? Who is that? This isn't your house. This isn't yourhouse, Ben! You trying to get my wife drunk and then take advantage of her? Oh, give me a break, Joanne's husband. If anything, I'm a pawn in your weird sexual golf game. Ben! You wife is so sexually aggressive, I'm not even that attracted to her. Hey! Kate: Oh, my God! (grunting) Will: Easy, easy. Easy. Relax. Relax. All right? Everybody just needs to calm down for a second. Okay? Breathe. Thank you very much, Will. Now, why don't you tell us why you left your wife? What? Kate: What? He's a leaver, Kate. He left his wife. At Christmas. Christmas? But that's when families come together. Ben: I know, right? He didn't even wait till Boxing Day. Wow. All right. Yeah, I left her three weeks beforeistmas. Because she never put our daughter first. Well, you got to put the kids first, yeah. Really. Who are you? 

[00:26:56]


I am so sorry. For all of this, okay? Mostly this part of it. So stupid. But I'm sorry for everything. It's... it's fine. (cell phone chimes) Oh, that's so nice. Joanne sent a text to see if I was okay. Oh, and she al sent a picture. (yells) Whoa! Well, that was actually one of the most embarrassing things that's ever happened to me. And the only reason why I'm speaking to you right now, Ben, is because what you did last night actually turned out to be kind of really amazing. It did? Yeah. We talked about his divorce, and our childhoods, and things that we would've never even gotten to for months. That was my plan. No, that was not your plan. No. That was not my plan. It was also not my plan to be used as foreplay by a crazy couple. That should only exist in the '70s. Maddie: Uncle Ben! Are you ready for Career Day? Uh, sorry, Maddie, but you have to have a career for that. I tried to find one for you, but the truth is, I still don't know what I want to be when I grow up. Well, then why don't you go talk about that? Ben: You see, the thing is, we can get hung up on trying to figure out exactly what our path is, but you never really know. You know? I mean, look at me. Did-did I make it rain as a wine salesman? Yeah, you bet I did. I mean, I don't want to get into amounts... $2,500, whatever. The point is, I tried. That's what you guys need to do. You need to go out there and try stuff. And don't worry about not succeeding. Right? Because trying is succeeding. Unless you're trying to fail, in which case, failing... then is succeeding. Ah...

[00:28:57]


Thank you. Yeah. Uh, the point is... You know what the point is? If you don't want to go to college... Whatever. Don't go to college. Screw it. You want to, you know, play grab-ass around Europe? Go for it. I don't care. My name is Ben Fox. Questions? Well, it took a year, she's finally cooking and cleaning. I knew this would pay off eventually. Does everybody like egg pie?

Hey. Sorry I'm late. Not really. Just saying what I'm supposed to. Not a great day to be late, 'cause a certain somebody-- our boss-- decided to show up. But don't worry, I covered for you. Oh, look who it is. What you doing here? I... own here. Yeah, you do. You do something different with your hair? Slept on it. What happened to yours? (chuckles) I like that. You know why men go bald, don't you? Excess of testosterone. My hair didn't stand a chance. And I'm surprised you have eyebrows. Oh, I've got them, all right. All over the place. Are you kidding? He's Buddy, and he's marri And, also, he's our boss. And, also, he's Buddy-- ew! His divorce finally went through. So? He's asked me out tonight. No. Shh-shh. ("Cherry Pie" by Warrant playing) (sighs) I played this song. So what? 
??? She's my cherry pie    Cool driner, such a sweet surprise     Tastes so good, make a grown man cry     Sweet cherry pie, yeah!   No. No. Ow.   Wake up     Look around     There's a feeling today     Fall down     Get up again     Get in the game     Hey, hey, hey     We're all here anyway.    ??????
Only nine short weeks, and myksumo knives have arrived. I'm gonna be able to cut through so much stuff. Ooh. Check this out. This came for you. Pretty fancy paper stock, huh? Rocksumo! "Tyler Swanson turns six." Not really grabbing me with that headline. Bouncy house! Nice save, Tyler Swanson! I hate bouncy houses. What? They're scary. What?! Mom said they cause 

[00:02:00]


more than 3,000 injuries per year. If we didn't do scary stuff, we'd miss out on some of the best things in life. Like, for example, using an Indonesian-made Japanese-style knife to cut through this VCR. Let's fact-check this infomercial, shall we? I don't know about this. (cell phone ringing) KATE: Hey, Ben. Ben: Okay, don't freak out. What did you do? Well, Maddie may or may not end up with, like, a small forehead scar. Are you there? I told you, she's fine. I'm sure she's not the first person to be nicked in the head by a flying rewind mechanism. I'm gonna get you a bandage. Why is this so light? Why is there so much stuff missing from my emergency kit? Why are you looking at me? Okay, and go! It was a lesson in physics, Kate. Ben, now that you're living with us-- and again, welcome to our home-- I need to know that you're gonna be prepared for emergencies like this. (cell phone ringing) Louise. Wow. (hushed): Louise? What?! Hang up the phone! Ben, hang up the phone! Listen, now's not a great time. Ben, she's crazy! Hang up the phone! Uh, 'cause my niece just cut her forehead and they may have to amputate. Yeah, so let's touch base if and when she pulls through. Okay? Bye! I thought you were done with Louise. I am. But I may have kind of hooked up with her a little bit. Oh, dude, you relapsed? With your crazy ex-girlfriend? Kate, a man has needs. I need to know that you're not gonna be distracted by this. I need to know that you can handle anything. Like what? Choking, second 9/11, sudden swelling of the tongue. That's easy. Same answer for all of them: I'd rely on my instincts, and for everything else, duct tape. Kate: I don't know. Maybe I'm just overreacting. Oh, you are under reacting. If Louise is back in the picture, his judgment has already been compromised. I know! Oh, my God, that's what I'm saying. They're bad together, Kate, like orange juice and peppermints. Exactly. And I can't have that around Maddie. I wish I could just, like, 

[00:04:02]


ask you to go over there and check it out and make sure everything's all right. Whoa. Okay, I cannot spy on Ben for you. That crosses so many lines for me. I know. That's why I would never ask you. That would be wrong... to do that for me. So wrong. I mean... to do it for you would be betrayal. I know. But if I did it for me... Well, that would be a completely different thing. It would be almost heroic. Tommy, that would be super heroic. Are you watching? This part's important. Okay, in the event of attack, always head for higher ground. MADDIE: Mom's scared of zombies. I know. That's why it's insane that she thinks she's more prepared than I am. Plus, she's a blonde, so if zombies ever did attack, you know she'd get eaten in the first five minutes, anyway. Right? Totally. (doorbell rings) What if it's a zombie? That's why you always look before you open the... Oh! (laughs) Hey. Hey. Hi! Louise. Oh... mmm... Okay. Hello, Benjamin. (both chuckle) Oh... Now is not a great time. Yeah, I'm babysitting my niece, and I'm 100% focused on her, so... You look really good. Oh, thanks. (chuckles) I've been kind of working out a little bit. I can tell. Yeah. I've been eating these Chia seeds, too. They help make me super lean. They're working. Thank you. I feel, I feel really... What am I doing? Look, I promised Kate that I would be focused on Maddie tonight. That's fine. I understand. I just came to get my sweatshirt. Oh. Uh, yeah, sure. You can just go around back and get it. Okay. So... I'll just grab the sweatshirt. Yeah, so maybe just grab it and take off quick. All by myself. And I'll see you later! Hey, guys, I just stopped by to grab my racket before I head into work. But I might as well eat this granola bar that I have in my pocket. Dude, why are you acting so weird? Wait. 

[00:06:03]


Oh, no. "Made in a facility that processes..." Tommy, no. (coughing) No. Uh, we knew this day would come. Maddie, Tommy has a severe peanut allergy, and he's gonna be in real trouble don't, um, um... Wait, what do we do? What do we do again? I'm call 911. Hold on, buddy. You're gonna be fine, okay? You know, I-I can't lie to you. I don't feel like my performance was up to par. Started off so big, so I had nowhere to really go. Kate put me up to it. There's no peanuts in this. What? She didn't believe that you can use your instincts to really help you in an emergency, Ben. Unbelievable! I can't believe she doesn't trust me! Hey. I just installed a web-cam. Guess where. Not in your shower. That'd be weird. year. jane. Trop50, everyone here's to a new look in the new year. What d'ya think? Wow! Fantastic! Yes, I've had a lot of work done. They had to scrape off quite a few layers. Ouch! You look amazing. Wait, not on me. On the apartment. You actually thought I had work done? You just look so great. You actually thought I had work done! Trop50. The goodness of orange juice with 50% less sugar and calories. 

[00:09:04]


Uh, okay, this is not what it looks like. I know a lot of people say that, but in some cases, like, statistically, has to be true. Where are your pants? In the car, in case I have to go someplace fancy. Hey, Tommy. Hey, Louise. You guys, the Three Musketeers are back together. Oh, I wish we had swords. Okay, you need to go home. Do you guys want to go in on a ski cabin this year? Okay, bye! Okay, that was unfortunate and completely not my fault. So there's no reason to tell Kate she was here, right? Come on! I swear I didn't know she'd show up, okay? I can't help it! I'm adorable! Fine. I won't tell her, but I hate being in the middle of you guys. I get it. I completely understand. That's why I'm not gonna ask for your help in trying to teach Kate a lesson about being prepared for emergencies. Yeah, because you asking me to help with that would be wrong. It'd be so wrong. But... if I wanted to help you, that would be different. Yeah... I guess that would be different. I-I'd kind of be, like, a hero. You'd be kind of, like... a superhero. Let's do this. What do you want me to do? (Ben and Tommy scream) I want you to go home! What are you doing here? Where's Maddie? She's with your double agent Tommy. So you don't trust me? I don't know. How's Louise? I don't know how Louise is. Unless you've talked to Tommy, in which case, she's fine. When are you gonna give her a break? She's not that bad. She's nuts. She's unpredictable. I don't want her around Maddie. Ben, Maddie's like my heart. Walking around in the world, outside my body. That doesn't even make sense, Kate. 'Cause, I mean, you'd die instantly. Having your heart... Exactly, Ben. When it comes to her, there's no such thing as being too careful. I love Maddie, too. I would never want anything to happen to her. But you can't prepare for everything. So you're saying that I should just throw away the emergency kit and never give her a flu shot? Flu shot? I eat 15 organic blackberries a day. Do the math; I'm immortal. What do you think? Is it too long? I can make it shorter. What do you think? You like like him. 

[00:11:05]


What? You've never asked me stion before. Because most of the time, I don't care what you think. Obviously, this dress is a showstopper. Don't you-- do you think? Obviously. Exactly! Okay, listen, I think that maybe since you like like Buddy, maybe you shouldn't sleep with him tonight. 'Cause then that's all it'll ever be. Interesting argument. Quick counterpoint: I'm extraordinarily good at sex and I like it. A lot. Fine. I'll give it a-- But I'm not-- no promises. (whispers): Maddie, I want you to get up, but I hate being woken up suddenly. So, first, I'm gonna whisper, (louder): and then my voice is gonna gradually build in volume until I'm talking in a normal voice like this. And you are awake! Maddie, get up. What's wrong? Oh, nothing. You know how your mom thinks she's prepared for everything? She said you would ask me that. Yeah, well, tonight, I'm gonna teach her a lesson about all of that. So if you hear or see anything weird, nothing scary is happening, okay? Okay. Sleep well. BUDDY: So you want to head out and get some dinner? You want to try the Marrakech Grill? Yeah, I can't go there. They think I'm Stanley Finkelstein. Who? Yeah. He's a high-level inspector at the Department of Health. He does surprise inspections, then he turns a blind eye for a comped meal. Seriously? Yeah. I don't go to a restaurant without bringing this. Little shard of glass in the breadbasket, huh? It's really sharp. This'll set you up all night. Uh-huh. (glass rattling) Wait a minute, you-you found a screw in your hamburger here. Was that...? But why? What's the angle? You work here, you eat for free. I know. I just... I guess it was for fun. F-Fun? Yeah. You're incredible. 

[00:13:06]


I know. I've never met an Australian woman like you. Yeah? That's great. What do you say we get out of here, huh? Mm-hmm. Go put some glass in our food. I'd love to. Emergency, emergency! Wake up, wake up! What? What? What happened? Everything. This is the mother of all emergency drills. The power is out, the cell phones don't work. I even had to board up the windows to keep them from getting at us. Is that real wood? Yeah. You know that house that's foreclosed down the street? I just popped off all the siding and just put it up on the windows. This is a rental house. Whatever. You may or may not get your security deposit back. But that's for another time. Who is "them"?

Kate? We're in the middle of a living nightmare, and your first move is to come to the kitchen? Uh-oh. Where did those candles go? Maybe they got obliterated when the sun melted. I got these babies stashed all over the house. Whatever. What are you gonna do for food? Just a little bit of this. Baked, black or pinto? Secret beans. Okay, whatever. Did not see that coming. But nobody remembers to bring the can opener-- damn it! I'm gonna go do a load of whites in the toilet tank. Clean and dry socks prevent gangrene, Ben. Okay, that's the least of your worries. What if some crazy, contagious person stumbles in and infects all of us? Hey, Tommy. Hey. Tommy, you were supposed to come in through the window. I was going to, Ben, but then I realized that me climbing through the window at night, that's like a one-way ticket to a candlelight vigil that turns into a riot. Well, I got particulate respirator masks for everybody. One of those was for you. That seemed unnecessary. Thank you. You're welcome. Okay, look, Ben, seeing as I'm gonna continue to ace all of these tests, could we at least please turn the power back on before all thfood spoils? In a real emergency situation... I got you ice cream sandwiches; they're gonna melt. Feel like I've proven my point. We can get that power back on, probably, right? You can't unplug a circuit breaker, Ben. This handful of wires begs to differ. (whispers): Stupid. Son of a mother! Hello, Ben. How's the fake emergency going? You need to go home, okay? I mean... You look fantastic. Look at those stems. Thank you so much. Why are you not wearing pants? Want to come and see? Yeah, we could probably-- No! KATE (in distance): Ben, what's happening? Can you fix the circuit breaker? Uh, no! Don't come back here! There's a raccoon! He's gotten into the wiring and he's really big! You need to stay here, okay? I will get you out of here when I can. Ben, I want to help out with the drill. Maybe I can go in the house and break some glass, and we can see if Kate has emergency shoes. Don't break anything. I won't. I promise. Maybe just one thing. What? I said, "I love you, Ben." (quietly): Damn it.

Dude, Weesu-Lay is still here. Who's Weesu-Lay? It's Louise. I was using pig Latin. No, 'cause then it would be Ouise-Lay. Weesu-Lay. Ouise-Lay. I checked on Maddie, and she's fine. Exactly! That's what I've been trying to tell everyone. There's nothing to worry about. I'm here now. Everybody can relax. I got everything under control. (crash in distance) What was that? That was the raccoon. Yeah. Probably best just to let him tire himself out. I'm on it. Why are we doing this? Kate, the point is, you're gonna make Maddie scared of everything. Someday, she's gonna head out into the world and she's gonna cut her head, and there's nothing you're gonna be able to do about it. But the best thing is to send her out there knowing that she's got a safety net. You don't understand what it feels like. You're not a parent.

I know there's acidophilus that is involved, you know. It has to do with cultures, Kate! Nobody ask me about tonight. I don't want to talk about it. Why is it so romantic in here? Because the power's out and all our food's going bad and we're being attacked by contagious zombies. BJ: So, anyway, it was on. As in, on. And we're on our way back to his house, and then I hear your stupid voice in my head telling me not to sleep with him. I panic and get him to drop me off here. This is good. This means that he'll just want you even more. It's a nightmare. (knocking on door) What? He wants me more now. No. Now in your house. No. Uh, my car broke down. Can I use your phone? Ah... power's out. Are you sure you didn't leave it in drive? That happened to me once. I was up in Modesto, and I was checking out this wind farm. AnI, like, parked on a hill and...

Hi. What a blast from the past. You look amazing. Thank you. I've been uff, just started Pilates, so... I kind of feel like I'm a bit strong-- got a bit leaner. It's wonderful to see you. Oh, Kate, I'm actually looking for a new bed, and your mattress is so comfortable. What is that? Pillow top? Memory foam? This is exactly what I'm talking about. Okay. I need to tell you something. Louise was the raccoon. I knew that she was the raccoon, Ben. (sighs): Ooh. That felt good to get off my shoulders. I'm sorry for keeping that from you. I promise you, I did not think it was an actual raccoon. Yes, maybe this wasn't the... you know, most efficient way to prove my point. I mean, should I have boarded up the doors, as well as the windows? Yes. Is this the worst emergency drill ever? Jury's still out. No, I think the jury's in. And it's unanimous. Nothing bad happened. You need to relax, okay? Everything is cool. I hate you. Uh, where's Maddie? I went to say good-bye to her, and she's not there. What?! What?! Maddie! Maddie! Maddie! Maddie? (singsong): Maddie? Where is she, where is she, where is she?! Maddie, where are you? Maddie! BEN: Maddie! KATE: Maddie? Where is she?! Maddie? (ceiling creaks) You guys, I hear something. I think it's in the ceiling. All: Maddie? Where are you? (ceiling creaks) What is that sound? MADDIE: Mommy, I'm up here. I'm okay. Ben: Oh, thank God! Oh, my God. I was so worried about you. What are you doing up there, baby? I found the highest point in the house, so the zombies don't get me. But now I can't get down. I'm gonna get the ladder, okay? Tommy: Uh, Kate, you know how ladders are sometimes used to rescue people, like in this situation? Well, Ben and I broke the ladder. It's not that far. Ben and I will catch you, okay? I don't want to jump. Jumping causes 3,000 injuries per year. (laughs) Is that an impression of you? That is amazing. Maddie: I'm scared. 

[00:27:37]


We've never practiced this before. Kate: I know. And it's my fault that you think that way. But sometimes you're gonna have to do things that you're afraid of and you're not gonna be prepared, but that's okay. Wait, hold on. I mean, let's not knock being prepared. I am trying to talk her down right now, Ben. Look, baby, I get scared sometimes, and I don't feel brave at all. But when you have people around you who love you more than anything, you just have to trust that they're gonna be there to catch you, and you got to just jump, feet first. You don't literally mean feet first, though, 'cause I think that would be really hard to catch her. Yeah, what's the metaphor I'm looking for? Tommy: Look before you leap. No. You know, uh, uh, it's all downhill from here. No. Onwards and upwards. That would make her jump up. It's like you're flying up... Reach for the stars! It's the same thing. It's the same going-up motion. I don't know. Let her fall. Okay, just jump, baby. We got you. Come on. We love you. Come on, Maddie. We got you. We're not gonna let you fall. We're all here for you. Come on, baby. We love you. Okay, careful! No tricks, no flips, okay? I got you something. Bandages for your emergency kit. Ben, these are for getting rid of warts. It says "warts" in big letters right there, and there. Oh. Oh, boy. Oh, no, no. I-I asked her to come. (sighs, splutters) Hey, Louise. We need to talk. Those two are adorable. I mean... No. BJ: Look at that. I'm gonna disagree with you. What was that? What? What? It's just a good-bye kiss. How else am I supposed to get my message across? I get it. Tommy, are you holding keys? Do you want to buy Maddie's glass eye or should I? Want to come in? Yeah. B-By the way, sometimes bouncing makes me vomit. Just so you know. Hey. That's so cute. That's so cute. (air hissing) Okay, have fun. It's good seeing you. Kate: Okay. Okay. Okay, everybody out. (laughing, squealing) Okay, okay, don't panic. BEN: What's happening?! Maddie?!

N series why shakespeare? We here from oscarruous difficult, steven greenblatt, harold blum and michael boyd. 
>> The thing that astonishes aublingters without portray him and all of us directors who try to take hamlet on is the way that he is infinitely proteon. You can find things of almost every different direction and every different time period. Like inside that character, and we're all hamlet because hamlet takes on our appearance. He takes on who we are. And speaks to us in any time. 
>> Why shakespeare when we continue. 
>> Funding for charlry rose was provided by the following:. 
>> Aya decisional funding provided by these funders:. 

[00:02:08]


>> From our studios in new york city, this is charlry Captioning sponsored by Rose communications from our studios in new york city, this is charlie rose. 
>> Brief candle. Life is but a walking shadow. A poor player of-- up on the stage. And then it hurt no more. It is a tale told by an idiot full of sound and furry. Signifying nothing. 
>> Welcome to our charlry rose special edition, why shakespeare. We will hear from some of the most celebrated actors, directors and scholars working today am they'll help us better understand the complexity and the genius of william shakespeare. Nearly 400 years after his death we're still left wondering how could one person write so beautifully, be so enduring and speak so eloquently to what it means to be human. Shakespeare's great rival ben johnson wrote of him, he was not of an age, but for all time. Laurence olivier once called him the nearest thing in incarnat the eye of god. William shakespeare was born in 1564 in the small pro vention english town of statford upon avon. He moved to london in the LATE 1580s AND IN A Remarkably short period of time became perhaps the greatest playwright of all time. The names speak for themselves. Hamleting king lear, othello, MacBETH, ROMEO AND JULIET. These plays have been passed down through generations. Theyazzle us with an appeal that transcends time and culture. Tonight in our first episode with the charlry rose shakespeare series we start with conversations on the greatness and the enigma. We'll talk to the director of the new york public theatre, barbara gainse, director of the chicago shakespeare theatre and hear from some others from previous appearances on our program. They include shakespeare scholar steven greenblatt and harold bloom, also the director of the royal shakespeare company michael boyd. We then conclude our evening looking at hamlet. Sir john ghoul good whose portrayals are considered some of the finest describe it as summing of the process of living, help us. With that, I would like to welcome you to the first episode in our charlie rose shakespeare series we call why shakespeare? I hope you enjoy the conversations. 

[00:05:04]


>> Good night, good night. Parting is such sweet sorrow. But I shall say good night so it be morrow. 
>> Rose: When somebody says to you who was shakespeare wa, do you say? 
>> He was the greatest writer in the history of the english language. He was the person who made the theatre democratic. And that's what made him the greatest writer. Because you look at shix spear, you look at him in context. And what he did was write for an audience and he had to simultaneously please illiterate ground lings, please cambridge educated intellectuals, please the aristocracy all at the same moment. Because the two to compromise had brought together an audience in that theatre that was more diverse and mixed than any audience that the western world had seen really since the greeks, sow had to write plays that spoke to all of these people at the same time. And that's why from my point of view that audience called shakespeare's greatness into beingment because by writing for all of them, he was forced to expand the range of human experience in those plays. So they still touch us today. 
>> So we need to think about the audience when we think about the writing. 
>> Absolutely. The beautiful example of this is we did a production of measure for measure that we told to the prisons earlier this fall. And there is one beautiful -- 
>> it was a fantastic production. And th moment where isabella has just been propositioned by anglo and told that she can save her brother's life who is going to be executed for forn case, if she will sleep with the judge who has condemned him. And he tells her this, and then leaves her devastated on stage. And she turned out to this audience. And this was a woman's prison on the west side here in manhattan and begins the soliloquy, she says to whom should I complain. And a woman in the audience shouted out, the police. And then nicole who played isabella delivered the next line directly to that woman. She said, if I should complain, who would believe me. And the woman answered, no one, girl. And what you saw at that moment, that these soliloquys were actually call and response, written in dialogue with that audience. This is not some art under glass. This is live theatre at its finest. And you know it makes it an incredibly communal art form. 

[00:07:36]


>> Rose: Why have we not seen another shakespeare? 
>> My personal feeling is it's because the social conditions necessary to turn a great writer into the greatest writer have not recurred. What happened for that couple of decades in elizabethan and early england waa society coming to consciousness of itself, mixing together the different classes, trying to forge a unity out of the different classes, and demanding that a writer write their story, reflect themselves back to them. And by doing that took a man who was always a great poet. Who was one heck of a sonnet writer, and threw him into that calderon and that pressure turned him into a writer that carried the hopes and dreams and aspirations of england on his beck. You see in the great history PLAYS LIKE HENRY 5th, Shakespeare is defining what it is to be english. He's helping the english create their own identity. He's wheting together the different nationalities of the welshman, the scotsman, the irishmen and giving them a sense of being british, of being more than just a collection of tribes. He's defining an english attitude towards royalty. Because of course what all of england is struggling with is we can no longer believe in the devine right of kings. Our own history purchases that. If we can't believe in the devine right of kings wrarx gives the king legitimacy. That is the question shakespeare is answering. 
>> He constantly comes back to. 
>> Exactly. And we haven't had a society-- . 
>> Rose: Or what the nature of a king's power. 
>> Exactly. But also what gives him the right to utilize it. 
>> Exactly. 
>> An in that little touch of harry in the night when king henry disguises himself and goes among his own soldiers and hears unvarnished and unsensored what they think of him with no ability to take retaliation or revenge, having to listen to them, you realize that's theing that gives him the right to be king. If he actually takes on himself the burden of his subjects. He owes them. He is responsible to them. And that is what earns kingship. 

[00:09:49]


>> Or he the day that sheds his blood with me shall be my brother, be he there so vial this day shall gentle his condition. And gentle of an england now a bed, think themselves a cursed they were not here. And hold their manhood, while then he speaks, that fought with us, -- 
>> why was he a genius? 
>> He could, that's a huge question. I think he sort of had the greatest, one of the things is that he had the greatest range of human sympathy. That the world has ever known. He wouldn't judge you. He just would be you. It's the being, isn't it. 
>> Would that be-- a sin no for that be empathy or you specifically mean sympathy. 
>> I mean empathy/sympathy. I mean he couldn't help himself. Even with a ruthless CHARACTER LIKE RICHARD 3rd. Murderer of children, right. He made us feel something for him, you know, on the beatle of bosworth field. We started to hurt for him and we hate ourselves for it. Because he couldn't help himself. 
>> How did he do that? 
>> He did that by making richard frightened. Afraid of his own guilt. And you saw the cracks appearing in this, what we thought was just a brutal cold murderer. And now we see a tad of humanity. 
>> Now do we see a bit of THAT in MacBeth as well. 
>> We doment we see a lot of that, that is why it is so brilliant because here we see a cold blooded murderer, MacBETH WHO STARTS THINKING About murdering the king as soon becomes-- instantaneously. He knows it's horrible. And yet he takes us with him on the psychological journey, oh my gosh, my moth weernt be happy with me. I don't know what my wife is going to say. But I've got to do it i can't stop myself. My managings are horrible. An we've all had horrible managings, haven't we. 

[00:11:52]


>> We have indeed. 
>> So that's the problem. All of those criminals, all the people in his text are us. It's very hard to separate ourselves from any of shakespeare's characters. 
>> Rose: So why do we think he was so wise? And observant? 
>> If I knew that. You know o I don't know what the answer to that is. All I know is the first folio his actors, the people that knew him wrote in the preface he was a against el and happy imitator of nature. And what he thought he wrote. For we have scarce received a blot on his papers. Therefore read him again and again and therefore if you do not like him, are you in some man fess -- manifest danger am isn't that something? So I don't know. I think it-- how did mozart do it. How did beethoven. I mean I think there are mysteries here that we will never be able to solve and that's fine with me. It's that it happened. That's what matter its. Where does genius come from. I don't know. 
>> Do we have to assume that shakespeare was fascinated by state, craft. 
>> State craft. 
>> The idea of state and relationships? 
>> Wow. 
>> Obviously the state and religion. 
>> But if you think about kings and queens and wars, they involve states. 
>> Yes. 
>> It's not about the medical profession. And it's not about the legal profession per se. 
>> It's a brilliant question. And I'm not a skol or in this regard. But I will just say a little bit about it. Is that of course shakespeare and elizabeth and the church of england and protestant and catholics, I mean when elizabeth was on the thrown, it was dangerous to be a catholic. What was shakespeare? You don't really know because the times were raw. People go, went to jail and were beheaded because they were not what the queen or the king accepted. So they were very dangerous times. And so I think that he was, you know, it's interesting. He rarely wrote a churchman, the shakespeare, who you really liked. You look at done --. 

[00:14:16]


>> Suggesting he didn't like churchmen. 
>> You could say that but then he writes cramner and he gives a beautiful speech about queen elizabeth at the end of henrey 8th that you have ever heard. Let's just say he was, i think shakespeare wisely was skeptical of people in power. Because he kind of thought it corrupted, I thinkment and you know, it's hard. What it-- okay, what is power? What do you think power is? 
>> Seriously? It's an interesting question. What is power. 
>> Power-- well -- 
>> the ability to exercise your will. 
>> Right. 
>> But often people use power don't exercise their will or doesn't turn out the way they want it to be so they, in fact, have failed at exercising their will. 
>> Control of yourself is what you are suggesting which I think is a brilliant thought, actually. Yes. But other people think power is money, or power is-- . 
>> Rose: Fame. 
>> Fame, or power is all of that, right. 
>> It is you that stirs these daughter's hearts against their father. Fool me not so much to bear it tamely. Touch me with noble anger. And then no one's weapons, water drop stain a man's cheeks. No. You unnatural hags! 
>> Rose: On balance is he an interesting man to you? 
>> He is a fascinating man to me. 
>> Rose: Not in terms of what he wrote but just in terms of him. If you didn't know, if you didn't have the body of work would you look at this guy and say he is fascinating or would you say a rather conventional light. 

[00:16:17]


>> What is fascinating is we can't strip the work away and throw it away, on the contrary. What is fascinating is precisely that he had a -- 
>> a careful life but an interesting life, cautious but complicated one in relation to this absolutely astonishing body of work. It's the relationship between the two things that matters, this isn't the swashbuckling life that is fascinating in itself. Sir walter raleigh had one of those. But shakespeare has a remarkable life, poignant and compelling life in relation to this astonishing thing. 
>> Since shakespeare without do you think has come close. 
>> Close to the body of work, to the genius. 
>> Well, I mean they are there are actually lots dns name three. 
>> Milton, keats, blake, words words word, lots and lots. 
>> Shakespeare is in a different category-- category, shakespeare is in the category that dante is in, that homer is in, that category that, what is fascinating is that this category, we assume somehow is only for gods but this is a human being. That is what is interesting. 
>> That is the point you want to make. 
>> This is a human being. Elaborate because that is one of the points you want to make. 
>> This is not a god this was say leviving the breathing, human being. 
>> By the time this man was 20 years old, he 4 three children, he had no job, no vocation. He didn't know what to do, his father's blood business is falling part. He hadn't gone to oxford, the family had lost its money. There was a religion that the family was associated with, was dangerous and percent kate-- purse cuted. There was not a future for him. They figured out to have not only a future but how to express this extraordinary thing he had inside him that is the remarkable story. 
>> Rose: What de teach you about love. 
>> He teaches that you can write brilliantly about love without ever fully having it. 
>> What does that say? 
>> It says that he longed for something deeply, that he never fully acquired and never fully achieved in his life. 

[00:18:25]


>> Rose: Exception in his imagination. 
>> In his imagination and perhaps at certain delirious moments but never as far as we can tell, this is someone without has written the greatest body of love poetry in our language but go paragraph about relationships that cannot be sustained. 
>> Okay, but dow just enjoy it and recognize it for its brilliance or do you say it is something that i assimilated and made me understand about? 
>> We are -- 
>> more than relationships. 
>> It starts with pleasure. And maybe it ends with pleasure so that the pleasure is actually crucial if you take if all of this. Of course beyond pleasure there is the effect it has on your life. When you try to sort out your life, you and i, when we try to figure out deeply what it is that we care about, in the real moments of our life, it turns out that this language, the language that shakespeare wrote gives us. 
>> Will give you access to that. 
>> Access to that. Helps you access it. 
>> In your own. 
>> That's true of any great, that's true of shix spear but really of the whole range of great artists, that is what they are there for. 
>> Explain that to me. 
>> If are you looking for something, let's imagine a situation of terrible loss. I havefully sons whom i adore and thanks god I never experienced the loss of a child the way shakespeare experienced. It's shakespeare without gives you the language. Why should a dog wrb -- 
>> the rat have life age no breath at all, the language to express these feelings that are otherwise potentially index pressable. This is what an artist does for us. 
>> Rose: Access our own feelings by, and giving you the capacity to comprehend. 
>> To comprehend and articulate. 
>> Is this a dagger which i see before me? The handle to warm my hand? Let me clutch thee. Yet I see thee still. Are thou not fatal, sensible to feeling as to cite. 

[00:20:50]


>> Rose: You thought about this a lot, I'm sure. Why shakespeare. What makes shakespeare, why was shakespeare shakespeare? 
>> He was as I say he was born into a time of extraordinary crisis,ed passing of the middle ages of faith and the birth of a new age of skepticism, a mercantile age. He was born particularly in england at a time of brutal and very, very fast revolution of the sacking of all the chumps, the removal of the virgin mary, the destruction of all images, in strat stratford we have the church where shares spear is buried, holy trinity, you can still see the scars to take away all those graph enimages. And he was himself from a catholic background. And he managed to deal with crisis, and to the get into jail thomas kidd, ben johnson, most of his contemporaries got into terrible trouble, christopher marlow was-- how did slax spear survive that is one of the things that makes shakespeare shakespeare, he survived. He, and one of the main ways that he both survived and became so good was that he unlike say christopher marlow or ben johnson without couldn't keep the author out of it, couldn't keep the editorial out of their play, shakespeare hid the editorial if dialogue. And the true lies like out of the "da vinci code", somewhere in between two characters. And the play happened there mysteriously but with clarity and with great power. And his ability to dramafy the split, whether it's the split between being a country boy in stratford and the court in london, whether it's the split between catholic or protestant, whether it's the split as i say between the age of faith and the age of rationalism and mercantilism, where it is the split between the old anglo sackson and the latin language of power, he sets them up, gets them talking to each other, and he never judges either side. If there's a judge. Us because if he did, people would know what his ed torial was and they could silence him. The editorial, if it's there, is so wrapped up in the nature of his writing, that it becomes good art, indivisible from its form. Whereas a contemporary ben johnson wrote beautifully, but it was an essay. Christopher marlow wrote stunningly, but it was a series of monologues. And jz are brliant, highly metrical, rhyming, relevant, passionate write, they're monologues. They're not and they're editorial. They're not capable in the way that shakespeare was of creating, it's not a hologram t is something much more profound than that. It's something that actually almost approaches the condition of life, in between the opposites of shakespeare's existence, both as a person and as an artist. I would say it is that duality in shakespeare that is the fundamental dna of his greatness.

>> Neither a borrower nor a lender be, for loan often loses of itself and friend and borrowing dulls the edge of husbandry. It is above all, to thine own self be true and it must follow as the night to day, thou cannot then be follow to any man. 
>> Rose: How do you explain the shakespeare. 
>> The best possible question to is at the beginning of the book is i can't explain him, after all these decades of teaching him. I think the proper stance towards him is awe. It is astonishing that it could have happened. You request trace any other writer to some source. You can talk about if you will, societal context. You can talk about history. But shakespeare transcends any context that you try to find for him. The power of creation in him. I think I can even focus it, there is an excess in him. There is an overflowing not just of meaning but of being. It's a sheer newness which comes flowing out of him for which we have no precedent and in a deep sense he has had no successor despite the fact he has been such an immense influence on all who came afterwards. He is I suppose the largest single miracle I know of not just in the history of the human arts but in the history of the human consciousness. 
>> I suppose that if you are a religious believer then you might want to talk about moses and jesus and mohammed. But as a secular figure, this is, has astonishing a phenomenon as any of the great religious founders have been. This is indeed the secular scripture, the complete plays of shakespeare or complete works of shakespeare. I think I remarked somewhere in that book in a kind of wonder myself that hamlet has become the intellectual's christ. And even though in the past I have been much condemned for saying that the western worship of god is the worship in the end of three literary characters, yaweh, the gospel of marks original, jesus and mohammed's lah, I think only shakespeare competes in his nine or ten strongest characters with those three great literary characters. Which of course, you know, is a somewhat blasphemous thing to say. But at one point in the book I only half jokingly since i am a dinosaur now in academic terms, refer to myself as-- I think that say perfectly good description. I see-- it seems to me a perfectly valid self-designation. But no, I cannot explain shakespeare. I can appreciate shakespeare. I can hope to help others to appreciate him more. I can hope to teach others to see that we must not condescending to him. That he is always out ahead of us and he always knows more than we do. He has always more than anticipated our latest developments. You can push any idea you want to into shix spear and it will not necessarily light up the play but the play will light up the idea. The power of minds, the power of consciousness, the power of sheer-- in him is beyond parallel. And if it's beyond parallel then in some sense it's beyond explanation. 

[00:28:50]


>> Now is the witching time of night when churchyards yawn and hell itself breathes out contagion to this world. Now could I drink hot blood and do such bitter business as the day would quake to look on. 
>> Now to my moth other. 
>> Oh, lose not thy nature, let not ever the soul of nevero ent they are firm bossom. Let me be cruel, not unnatural. 
>> I will speak daggers to her but use none. My tongue and soul in this be hypocrite. How in my words so ever he be shamed to give them-- never my soul-- . 
>> Rose: Let me begin with hamlet and ask what's the context, the historical context? 
>> The historical context is that it was a play written 1599 or 1600. By shakespeare. There had been a hamlet play that had been a success. Shakespeare often uses other people's materials, is sensitive to what is working in the theatre. That had a play, possibly even two of them before that, based on very old story. A story that had been hold multiple times that goes back to I 12th century danish chronicle. And shakespeare takes this story which is a revenge story, a bloody mystery and he turns it into arguably the greatest single tragedy ever written and certainly a life changing work for him. His career really pivots around-- . 
>> Rose: What happened to his career. 
>> His career was also already magnificent before then. 
>> Rose: This unloaded, he had unleashed a wol series of -- 
>> it initiated an unbelievable outpouring of work including plays like othello and pac beth and king lear. It also unleashed something in shakespeare in itself. He uses more words in hamlet, including more words that had never appeared in print before. They muses have been in the at least to some extent in the culture. Then any one has ever released in a single work so it was written in a whole new language for him. Absolutely extraordinary outpouring of new relationship to his own language, to what it is to, what you can address an audience with. And it changed everything. 

[00:31:19]


>> Rose: There are parts of this that are of this that might have unleashed this in him? Was there any part of the subject matter that might have had some catharsis for him? 
>> Speculative we could say that it can't be entirely an accident that his son's name was hamlet, which is not only very close to hamlet, obviously but also interchangeable with the record with the name hamlet sometimes spelled either way. His son had died in 1596 at 11 years old. And then his father was also depending on when the play was first drafted dead or dying. And so there probably are in his own immediate life things that are disturbing him, that he wants to come to terms with. 
>> And are where do you put it in the context of elizabethian world? 
>> What happens, at least one of the pieces that is fascinating for me, this is a play about as shakespeare tells it, about a ghost. A ghost coming to his son and demanding revenge. That the peculiar thing about that act is that from about50 years before shakespeare wrote this play, his culture had changed the rules governing the relationship between the living and the dead. Protestantism said there are no ghosts, there are only $ons that come from the other world. Ghosts are a remnant of the superstition of perg tore, the idea of perg tore, catholic superstition forbidden and they changed the rules and say you can no longer pray with the dead or for the dead. You can't pray for the remission of pain. And in fact, the very simple change in the burial service in the years before shakespeare writes the play. They change the words from we commit thee to the earth, ashes to ashes, dust to dust, to we commit him or her to the earth. And in other words, you are no longer speaking to a thee, to an i-thou relationship to a person. Because the person no longer exists, is dead. And it's just someone who is now in the earth. And that change should make it in effect impossible for a ghost to come back, to demand revenge unless that ghost is not a ghost at all but a demon. Now what's amaze being shakespeare's play of course is that that is precisely the question that hamlet asks himself. What is this? Am I encountering the demon who is trying to lead me astray. Can I catch this ghost. Can I find out whether it actually is a ghost, that is to say somehow a returner from the other world, the other world which could only be this now forbidden world of a middle state between heaven and hell. 

[00:34:19]


>> Rose: Who do you think the ghost represents? 
>> The ghost is, what the ghost is says your father's spirit, hamlet, but what it means to be the father spirit is tied up with centrally in the play with what the ghost tells hamlet he wants hamlet to do. Remember me. 
>> So the ghost says revenge, but the ghost repeats again and again remember me. So in answer to your question I would say the ghost is first and foremost about remembrance of the dead. What it is, what kind of life the dead have, not simply-- that's why these religious issues though they are fascinating as part of the surrounding of the play, you don't need to know this to encounter this play and to feel it in your bones. All you need to know is something about what it is to remember. What it is to remember, especially here, people who are gone. And what kind of negotiation we have with the people who are gone. What claims do they have to make on us. 
>> All right, take a look at this. We will see a scene now, a clip from richard burton's hamlet in the encounter. 
>> I am my father's-- you for a certain term will walk the night and in the day confined to -- 
>> wrb -- 
>> but this he internal must not-- flesh and blood, lives, lives oh lists, if thou discover-- oh god, a most unnatural murder. 

[00:36:32]


>> Murder! 
>> Murder most-- of this most fouls strange and unnatural. 
>> Eyes as swift as wings, may sweep to my will veng. 
>> And of course he doesn't sleep to his revenge. Instead there are five acts between that moment in which he thinks he's going to act instantly, and what actually we see which is a brooding, meditating, for tured consciousness that only ends in the chaos and mayhem of the scene at the end of accidental, crazy, activity and the murder and mayhem of the danish court. 
>> Rose: Do you read any freudian interpretations of this? 
>> There are certainly is a deep problem of memory, not simply memory of the father but the disturbance of the memory of the mother. The living mother in her relationship with the dead ther. And now in the relationship with the uncle. You don't need freud to tell you that that is a does tushance. Because hamlet tells it you it's a disturbance. Don't let him put his reachy fingers on youment don't plant reachy kisses on your lips, he says, about-- he says to his mother about the uncle. He is obsessed with the mother's sexual life. And as I say, this is in the play itself this is not an imposition on the play. 
>> Rose: A couple, why does he get,an who is he and why does he get the great line? 
>> The great line being. 
>> This above thyie to fh-- thine own self be true. 
>> It's not clear. You can goto ways with this, and play it two ways, one is he is a mattering old too fool, if you play it that way, you emphasize the fact that most of these chestnuts may be foremost them, are good things to say but they don't correspond to actual living experience let alone the living experience of hamlet who doesn't even know what his true self is, who can't figure out what his relationship is to himself. The whole play is about the fact that it's impossible to put these things together. So I tejd to be on that side of things. But you can also play it age I think maybe shakespeare's con temp lears have found it interesting as a set of perfectly good advice though it may not be good advice that you live by. 

[00:39:03]


>> When you teach shakespeare at harvard, what do you want your students to come away with? 
>> I want them first an foremost tos. 
>> Experience the play as fully and pleasureably as they k not something as a nug tote carry away but to open themselves to the play and let it. 
>> Work on them. Let it speak to them in the deep and powerful way it can. First an foremost for me really is not a lesson. 
>> It's about what it is first of all to be a human being in the world, to suffer to wonder who you are when are you in the case of my students and in the case of hamlet, when you are at the early stage of your life when are you trying to sort out who you are and what your destiny will be, what your vocation is, it familiar usly speaks to people, of exactly the age of many of my students. 
>> It speaks it to them in terms of how the pathway to finding that out? 
>> Well, the pathway to finding it out and the difficulty of finding it out what a struggle it s what a complex act it is to try to know who you are. To try to fulfill the expectations of your parents. To make your way in the world. To understand that you are not simply in the world to make it what you want but you are given a set of in effect commands and you can asquestions about them. And question them. But you can't escape them. You have to struggle with them. And see where they lead you. And hamlet is of course a tragic case of this. Or cursed spite that ever a was born. That experience over the centuries has spoken to generations and generations of not just students but to readers and audiences of all ages. 
>> It really is I think the deepest and hardest question is to be able to find that thing that you, that is the perfect marriage, you know, of your dreams and your competence and your passion. 

[00:41:15]


>> What a piece of work is a man, he says. 
>> What a piece of work is a man am but for him it has fallen apart. And the play of course is about someone who, of immense gifts who precisely can to the do what you have just described and find the core of himself and find the way through but who winds up dead. 
>>> Tell me then for the benefit of me and this audience the story of happy let. Why did this play in terms of the narrative. 
>> This, what you have, i believe that the essential things that's made hamlet last all these years is a young man who has feelings of alienation, of despair, of grief, of anger, of cynicism, that he does not know how to place in the world. He is seeking for how to commit an action. How to take his place in the world. And he's living in a world in which to his eye there is no viable, ethical, awe then-- authentic way to participate in the worldment and he slams up against that for five acts. And that experience, I think, is so common to us that we have been able to read it over the centuries through a million different historical lenses, theoretical lensesment. 
>> nd HE IS TRAGIC BECAUSE He doesn't know how to do that? Or is he tragic for some bigger and deeper rfern, as a tragic figure. 
>> Tragedy is a tough term. And I wouldn't want to try and straight jacket poor hamlet too much by aristotle's categories. 

[00:43:21]


>> Right. 
>> But what I would say is that the tragedy is his inability to find a place to be effective in the world. And because he can't find that, we end up essentially with denmark destroy by the end of this play. The country he loves -- 
>> he cannot find a place to say. 
>> He cannot find grace. 
>> Let's look at some scenes. The first is claudius and ger trud for hamlet to stay in denmark. Here it is. 
>> Good hamlet, cut thy collar off and let thine eye look as a friend on denmark. Do not forever with thy lower lid seek they final father in the dust. All that lives must die. Passing through nature to eternity. 
>> I, madame, I is common. 
>> If it be, why is he so particular with thee. 
>> Nay, it is, I know not seems. 'Tis not alone my cloak, good mother nor customary suits of solemn black, together with all forms, molds, shows of grief that can denote-- these indeed seem for they are actions that a man might play. That I have that within which passette show these but the trappings and the suits of woe. 
>> Rose: . 
>> It's also in a way that little speech of hamlets defines who he is. I know not seems, these are actions that a man might play but I have that within which passette show. And it is sort of a core idea of who hamlet is. He has an interior being which he cannot express externally. He has a sense of authenticity of emotion, of feeling, of spiritual state that he doesn't know how to put into action. 

[00:45:31]


>> The next scene we're going to show is obviously to be or not to be soliloquy. Take a look at this. 
>> To be or not to be. That is the question whether it is nobler in the mind to suffer the slings and arrows of our greatest fortune, or to take arms against a sea of trouble os and by opposing, and then-- to die. To sleep no more. And by asleep to-- say we end the heartache and the thousand natural sho that-- as a consumician about yet to be wished, to die, to sleep, to sleep. 
>> You can literally see the camera trying to go into olivier's head. The choice of the voice over is so radical for the time. But it's also actually a powerful response to the film as medium. The soliloquy is interactive and dialogic with the audience, the film isn't. So the voice-over gives us that interiority of hamlet in a way that obviously olivier felt incredibly fresh and new at the time. 
>> Rose: Is hamlet, is he sympathetic as a character? 
>> He is both sympathetic and frustrating. One of my great teachers said to me when I asked him once if a character was likable, he said our connection to characters is an id connection. It's not a superego connection. And what he meant by that, it was brilliant a that we don't connect to whether characters are ple sand-- pleasant. We connect them if we understand what they want, we understand what they feel f we connect to them on a vit ral level it doesn't mat ferr they are pleasant or if we like them. And for me and for millions of other people, hamlet is a character whose incredibly identifiable with, we find ourselve notice him. So whether he we like him or not, because actually he's a whining pet lent, nasty little boy. 

[00:48:08]


>> Rose: Right. 
>> But we understand him. So we connect. 
>> Rose: I got you. All right, the next let me look at the next clip. Is hamlet lashes out for her betrayal. 
>> I did love you once. 
>> Indeed, my lord. You made me believe. 
>> You should not have believed me. For you cannot so inoculate your old stock but we can relish, I love you not. 
>> I was pore definite deceived. 
>> Why would,000 be a breeder of sinners. I am myself indifferent, honest, but coy accuse me of such things I had better my mother not informed me. And what should such fellows as I do crawl between earth and heaven. Believe none of it. Go thy way to another. 
>> . Where is your father? At home, my lord. Let the door be shut above him. That he may play a fool nowhere but -- farewell. 
>> Help him-- ashamed that I -- thou shall the not escape, go, farewell, because if thow need marry, marry a fool. The wise man-- what monster you make of them. Go! Go! And quickly too, farewell. 

[00:50:17]


>> Rose: So what is going on between the two of them? 
>> Hamlet and o theoia. 
>> You can look at this in two almost contradictory ways. One is that hamlet is expressing towards othielia all of his disgust towards women. And that disgust towards women's behavior and women's sexuality has been aroused business his mother's behavior. And he is projecting it on her. And slathering her with the disdain he feels for all women kind. 
>> Rose: Right. 
>> At the same time, the text is absolutely clear that he recognizes that she is being used as a pawnment and she has agreed to stage this scene with him and to be observed by polonius and claudius, to try to find out the secret of hamlet. So at that point the betrayal that he feels by her is not just a generalized betrayal by the entire sex. It's also a specific portrayal by his girlfriend. And the fact that shakespeare gives you both of those possibilities to play with is part of what makes him the greatest playwright. 
>> Take a look. This is scene five, act five, scene one, the graveyard scene where hamlet is holding the skull. 
>> Alas, I knew him horacio. The fellow of infinite jest, of most excellent-- he hatt borne me on his back a thousand times. But now in my imagination it is, my george rises. Here hung those lips that i have kids, I know not how often. Where be your jibes now? Your songs, your gambles. Your flashes of meriment. Not one now to muck your own grinning. Quite chock fallen. Now get you to my lady's chamber. Tell her, let her paint an inch thick to this favor she must come. Make her laugh at that. 

[00:52:47]


>> Fantastic. Just think, at the end of this play, no matter how much shakespeare cut it or anybody cuts it you've been in the theatre for hours. You've watched all of it this action. You have watched sword fights and murders and hamlet flee as broad and plots and then everything slows. And-- the graveyard and hamlet looking at the skull of a character that he has never even mentioned before and meditating on mortality it is an extraordinarily bold thing for a writer to don't and what I think takes us on handle let's journey understanding that whether he actually sees his own death coming or not, he's understanding something about death. He did fear death, or not. 
>> He hamlet? 
>> Yeah. 
>> He certainly says he's afraid of death. That's the content of to be or not to be. You know, the born undiscovered country whose born no travel returns. But by the end if there is providence in the fall of a sparrow, readiness did -- by the end he's come to accept something about that. 
>> Remind us what his journey was from the beginning scene we saw to where he ends up. What is-- is it approaching madness? 
>> Is hamlet feigning madness in order to allay the suspicions of the king? He is actually going mad? Shakespeare doesn't give us definitive instructions on which of those it is and again that's part of the greatness. And again like most human beings he's probably not entirely conscious of what he is doing, he, however, is in this mad-like state in the court until finally confronting his mother with what he views as her crimes and her complicity in his father's death. He kills polonius thinking he is killing his stepfather and dlaud yens exiles him, sends him off to england, gives instructions to his two friends to pass to the king of england that hamlet is to be murdered. Ham let uncovers these instruction and instead sends the two off to be murdered, comes back to england, arrives first in this graveyard. And then throws himself on the grave and finally heads towards that final fat dual rses thank you for coming.

=======================================================

Suzanne malveaux continues with newsroom. 
>>> Happy new year. Welcome back to "cnn newsroom." I'm suzanne malveaux. We have a lot going on. A deal on the table but not out of the woods yet. All eyes on capitol hill, as the republican controlled -- the house, rather, convening this hour for the fiscal cliff negotiations. Now vice president joe biden, he is heading to the hill for talks with the house democrats. This is a critical moment for the country. Talking about 12 hours after the deadline for the government action has passed. The senate okayed a deal wee hours of the morning, prevent middle class income taxes from going up but raise rates on come of more than $400,000 a year for individuals, more than $450,000 for couples. Now, unemployment benefits for 2 million americans would be extended for a year. What it does not address is the spending cuts. Lawmakers plan to revisit the difficult issue. That is delayed two months from now. Going to bring you all angles of the story here. Of course following this, every single move. Dana bash on capitol hill, jessica yellin at the white house, christine romans live from new york and alison kosik in new york, hearing from folks in a diner. Dana, you were up really late into the night, early into the morning here, there is more business to be done and we know at this hour involves the vice president. He's going to be meeting with democrats, house democrats. What do we expect will come interest that meeting? When do we think we'll get something from the house side? 
>> Reporter: Well, first of all, right, in 15 minutes the vice president is going to be here on capitol hill to meet with his fellow democrats, in or to sell the deal that he cut. He's going to try to convince particularly the more liberal members of the caucus, that they should vote for this. And that is a concern because talking to senior democratic lawmaker who knows kind of the atmospheric inside, they could lose 30 members of the liberal caucus. That's an important meeting. Even more important meeting going to happen 45 minutes later, an hour from now, house republicans will get together. They're going to figure out how to go forward and if even going to tack a vote in the house today. We'll be watching that. I also want to tell you that, you know, oftentimes here we walk around the hallways and bump into people and get interesting information. I went downstairs in the basement going to get coffee and I bumped into congressman norm dicks kind enough to join us. I wanted him to share -- first of all, thank you for coming on. 

[00:02:44]


>> Nice to be with you. 
>> Reporter: I wanted you to share with viewers, I thought it was fascinate, you came from the house gym. That's where a lot of business gets done. Republicans, democrats. What did you hear from your colleagues working out this morning whether you think this is going to fly? 
>> There were some democrats and some republicans who were for it. There were a company democrats that were against it, one from the more liberal caucus, one who had maybe other reasons. But it's going to be a split decision. I think the biggest thing here is what the republican conference decides, if they're going to bring this up. I think there will be enough votes between the democrats and the republicans, as we've done on appropriation bills all year long, to pass this thing. I'm always an optimist. 
>> Reporter: You are a democrat, retiring democrat, which I'll get to in one second. You know your kuk cuss well. How many do you think you'll lose? 70 member of the progressive caucus, many not happen r. With the deal because of the tax cuts go and own reasons. 
>> If I had to guess, around 150 democrats would vote for it. We have absentees, too, another thing that on both sides, I'm sure are going to be counting who is here, who isn't. That can make a difference. And I would assume that we have enough republicans to pass this thing. You know, this would be a real blow to the country, to the economy, if we fail here and with the major overwhelming vote in the senate, 88-8 is amazing. And vice president biden is going to address the caucus at 12:15. And so I hope -- I hope -- i hope he and the president will work the phones and get these people to support it. 
>> Reporter: You're retiring. 
>> Right. 
>> Reporter: After 36 years. 
>> Right. 
>> Reporter: In the house of representatives. 
>> That's right. 
>> Reporter: A long time. So this is probably the last vote that you take as a congressman? 

[00:04:45]


>> It will be one of last votes. We have to have vote on adjournment. We also have the supplemental coming up. 
>> Reporter: That's true. 
>> Very important, new jersey and new york. And I'm the ranking democrat on appropriations. So I'm going to get one last chance to be on the floor battling. We're supporting this bill. 
>> Reporter: Talk about you have seen things change here. And change when it comes to both parties, the atmospherics, dynamics. 
>> Well, it's -- when I first got here, we had 295 democrats. It wasn't even conceived the republicans would be in the majority. And so people worked together. It was a completely different atmosphere. When I was a staffer in the senate we had 67 democrats. And ool on every bill -- 
>> Reporter: Nixon was president. 
>> He signed environmental legislation, clean air ability, clean water ability, the national environmental policy ability, epa was created. Nixon signed it into law. It was a completely different atmosphere when I first got here in 1976. We had 295 democrats. I mean, you know, it was 2-1 over the republicans. So -- 
>> Reporter: Whatm>fy is your diagnosis of why things have changed. 
>> Since newt gjngrich became speaker, this place has been very competitive and both sides want to be in control. And because of that, there is -- and the country's split. The country, a lot of people out there who are fiscally conservative, others like myself believe in the short term we've got to do more, do infrastructure, things to get this economy moving ahead and that will reduce the deficit. That wilt lower unemployment and do positive things for the country. 
>> Reporter: Genuine -- 
>> the problem with the republicans they believe their rhetoric. I guess -- I guess some of us democrats believe our rhetoric. I'm a paul krugman devotee. Austerity hasn't worked. We need more h1gstimulus. 

[00:06:50]


>> Reporter: Serendipity that i bumped into you. We don't get to hear what really goes on in the house gym. This is good scoop. 
>> Absolutely. I was wondering if that's part of their new year's resolution, if they do that on a regular basis. 
>> Reporter: They do it on a regular basis. 
>> Every day. A whole group. A huge group down there. 
>> Good. We hope that they resolve to never let this happen again, too, to really conduct business in a different kind of way. People are so frustrated with the way things are going. Explain what's go on on the house floor there. I know they have convened. A lot of people speak passionately, I assume about the fiscal cliff before the republican convene in a smaller group. 
>> Reporter: The house convened at 12:00 and what happens when the house convenes, every day they have what's called one-minute speeches. This is one the opportunities for members of congress to come and say their peace and say what's on their mind and they have one minute. I'm sure what is on all members' mind at this point how they feel about the fiscal cliff deal. 
>> Looking at live pictures of that taking place there. We'll bring you back to get behind the scenes from the gym but also from the floor and whether or not there's anything that's going to come of these meetings, whether or not there's a vote on the house side. There were eight senators who voted against that compromise measure, the opposition coming from both parties yet senate democrats tom harkin, tom carper and michael bennet voting no. So did mike lee, richard shelby, RAND PAUL, CHUCK %A#zGRASSLEY, MARCO Rubio, a tiny minority. The senate passed the fiscal cliff deal with an overwhelming bipartisan vote. It was 89-8. Want to bring in jessica yellin at the white house. You, too, were up late early in the morning here. The president, how does he feel things are going? We went over the cliff but clearly there's still more work to be done. 

[00:08:56]


>> Reporter: Well, look, they're not coming out and talking so they're being careful and letting the process unfold as it needs to. But there's a sense here that this deal will get done. And that they have wrapped up this -- this part of the process will be wrapped up today, suzanne. And you know, I'd say that there's also a sense here that the president did get a win. That's the view from this end of pennsylvania avenue. There are many different views on the other end. The sense here is that, for example, this is as they're saying in their talking points the first bipartisan agreement to raise taxes on the wealthy in 20 years. Now, that is, in fact, an accomplishment for a democratic president they got a concession from the republican party to let taxes increase on the wealthy. You know we should acknowledge that in this measure that is a significant change from past policy, and they feel that that is something that is worth chest thumping. Now it is something many democrats in their own party are disappointed with because it didn't hit at 250, it hit at 450 for households. And because they wanted to see more in this deal. And republicans are critical because there's not enough deficit reduction so are moderate democrats. The white house argument to that is, there's time to have that deficit fight. We're having that fight in about two months. 
>> ??jF%??AND, JESS, WANT TO KNOW ABOUT The president's role here. Yesterday, interesting how things played out. I mean from hour to hour, minute to minute. We saw the president come out very publicly, encouraging the republicans, saying we don't have a deal yet but we're pretty close here, you know, on the senate side. A lot of republicans were upset after he came out. They didn't like his tone, they thought it was to braggadocios and it look like for a moment a backlash against the president WHEN WE SAW senator McCain coming out and speaking against him. Do we anticipate the president's going to lay low while the house sorts out all of this, perhaps a lesson learned from yesterday? 

[00:11:08]


>> Reporter: Well, I would say, yes, I don't -- I do not expect to see the president before the house votes. But I don't think that's in response to yesterday. I think that was -- that's always how they operate and they wouldn't want to say or do anything to sort of distra attention from the process up there. Yesterday's comments were intented to product democrats in the senate to get on board and they sort of whatever, you know, hands up here, big shrug of the shoulders the republicans were annoyed by the comments, the bill still passed. I would point out, I'm told the vice president is going to be leaving here momentarily. We have not seen hess motorcade depart yet but any moment now. You know, the president is, my understanding from multiple sources, personally involved in this deal behind the scenes, while the vice president and senator McConnell were the ones on the phone in the very end. It was the president, the sources say, who insisted that this agreement to put off those spending cuts be included in the deal and that they be paid for with the combination of tax increases and pay downs, which we've discussed in some detail. 
>> And do we know if the vice president, when he's going to be meeting with house democrats, do we know specifically who he's meeting with and what he's trying to do to corral them to come together? 
>> Reporter: Well, it's my understanding, I think dana's report, he's meeting with the caucus to take questions and let them vent or make inquiries. And you know, he was -- he's not only been on the ground floor of this negotiation, but remember, he helped build the whole negotiation that led up to the debt ceiling fight in 2011 and knows the intricate details of all of this policy. He can answer questions not only about what's in the legislation, but what's not in the legislation, what's left to do in the new year, and -- it is the new year. I was up until 2:00 a.M. What's left to do in the next fight. And as I keep saying we rolled into the next fight over the debt ceiling. One of the messages, I think you'll hear him deliver is, hey, congressman so-and-so you're upset about that, we can have that fight right now when we begin the talks about the debt ceiling, for example. 

[00:13:33]


>> All right. Good. Interesting to see what comes of all of this. Happy new year, jess. We are in this new year. We'll get back -- you'll have a chance to party later. All of this is said and done, all over with, a lot of work to be done. Deal or no deal, american taxpayers are getting fed up, right, with what is happening in washington, all of the bickering. We'll hear what you think about it and what is happening on capitol hill. 
>> I cannot begin to tell you how irresponsible I think this has been for both parties to play all the politics they've been playing and leaving the people out, leaving the people's concerns out and just letting this thing happen. Both parties are responsible for this. Both of them have been playing just little silly games. day news starts with arthritis pain and a choice. Take tylenol or take aleve, the #1 recommended pain reliever by orthopedic doctors. Just two aleve can keep pain away all day. Back to the news. work arthritis. Try capzasin-hp. It penetrates deep to block pain signals for hours of relief. Capzasin-hp. Take the pain out of arthritis. 

[00:16:48]


>>> We are waiting and, of course, watching for what happens in washington here. House democrats meeting with the vice president at this hour, perhaps even within minutes. Leaving the white house and meeting with members of congress, the democrats, obviously, to push forward on negotiations to make sure that the house passes some version of a compromise to make sure that the country does not face severe tax hikes, as well as spending cuts. There is a deal on the senate side now, the house has to convene and figure out whether or not they approve of that version, whether thee going to amend it or if they've got their own version in hand and that, of course, is the work of3??i/ the vice president as well, even if the fiscal cliff deal is passed, many of us going to end up paying more taxes than we did last year, that's because the payroll tax cut was allowed to expire. Nobody's trying to revive that. I want to bring in our business correspondent christine romans to join us, talk about this. What is the difference here? This tax cut, it's been around since, what, 2009 or so, to boost the economy. Tell us how the payroll tax is different than the others. 
>> The payroll taxes come out of your paycheck automatically and used to fund social security. Costs dids 120 billion for the treasury department to instead let you have a little smaller part of your paycheck goes to social security taxes and general funds used to cover the difference. You've had a little holiday. You've had a holiday for the past couple of years and that means you've been paying 4.2% toward payroll taxes. It's going back up to 6.2%. The more money you make, the more you're going to pay. Let me show you exactly what it means. If you make $35,000 a year, you're going pay $700 more a year. If you make $50,000, you'll pay a thousand. Everyone look for your bracket there, because what this means you're going to have a smaller paycheck. Meant to be a temporary boost to the economy. And in the fiscal cliff, it is really temporary. They're not going to extend it. 

[00:18:53]


>> How important it is, the markets are not open today but they're going to be open tomorrow, that there is some real deal in hand from the senate side and the house side to indicate there is stability here? 
>> So look, you had a good year for stocks, s&p 500 up 13%. You had stocks up very strongly on the last trading day that they could trade, right? They are anticipating a deal. If you don't get a deal, markets are closed today if you don't get a deal it would be tough for tocks. If you do get a deal -- 
>> I want to interrupt you for a moment. I want viewers to know what we're watching here. This is live at the white house. The vice president getting into the motorcade there. You can see the secret service outside. The vehicle. And of course the motorcade traveling to the hill where he'll be meeting with the house democrats to talk about pushing forward on the house side. I think we're turning some tape here. You can actually see the vice president, he's -- he's in that vehicle. That's going to be key to moving things forward on the house side, at least. But christine, you were explaining some of the ways that we are going to be impacted by this. Of course the markets and how they behave when they see this kind of uncertainty, as we watch THE SAUSAGE BEING MADE, IF YOU p47]]%119 
>> Man, it's so ugly, isn't it? That process is so ugly. If you were to have the house add amendments or not do something, you know what many in washington are saying the worst-case scenario the house doesn't move forward and avert the fiscal cliff, it would be tough for the markets. Marks are telling us they think there's been a momentary judgment call, they've done the right thing and the markets think something's going to get done here. So a solution is priced into the market here. If you don't get a solution, it's going to be a problem. E first day but certainly a problem. I've talked to congressmen, you have, too, they have 2008 and t.A.R.P. Fresh in their memory. Remember when they didn't pass the bank bailout? 

[00:20:57]


>> Sure. 
>> Wall street said, that's not going to work and the stock market went down 700 points. They have that fresh in their memory. They don't want -- they don't want to do anything like that. So they're being very careful here, I think. 
>> Christine, tell us about some of the things that were, at least on the senate side, tax goodies, things saved, some of the things that we didn't lose because of the agreement on the senate side. 
>> It's interesting, when you look at, for example, write-off for teachers for supplies they get for the classroom, the parent and college tuition kind of tax breaks especially for lower income families, throws on there. I've been investigating the extenders for business and sweet goodies for business because they want to try to get companies to spend their money. The money's been sitting in the bank, companies saying we're not doing anything, we're not buying new software, we're going to wait to figure out if washington can get it together and we know what kind of situation we're going to have for tax for the beginning of the year. So we're digging into what all of the other things are. There are the amt, for example, permanently patched. And for doctors, a lot of doctors, concerned about potential 27% cut to their medicare reimbursements. That's been fixed as well. 
>> All right. Christine romans, thank you very much. We're waiting for the vice president. He's going to be arriving on capitol hill, meeting with house democrats to try to figure out a way to get them altogether all on board because, of course, you're going to have the republicans and the democrats have to work together on their own version to avert the going off the fiscal cliff, the senate side does have an agreement and it all depends on the house and how these two sides will come together and present something that the president can sign. We'll be -- we'll be following this throughout the hours. SFX- "sounds of african drum and flute" Look who's back. Again? It's embarrassing It's embarrassing! We can see you Carl.

[00:25:10]


>>> Keeping a close eye on what's happening in washington today. The vice president just left the white house. We just saw him leaving in his motorcade, heading to capitol hill where he's meeting with house democrats to try to cobble together something on the house side to avoid the fiscal cliff. We are also seeing on the house floor there these are republicans, some democrats as well, but a lot of fiery rhetoric, a lot of really pointed opinions about where THIS COUNTRY'S 9',??Jj HOW TO Avoid the fiscal cliff, what needs to happen, regarding taxes, regarding spending cuts, all kinds of things. But clearly this is their moment, each one of them getting a minute to talk about what they believe we should be doing to avoid the fiscal cliff. I want to listen in. 
>> Congress must regain its full power acored under the constitution, article i, second 8, to coin, create money, invest in our nation, interest free. To put america back to work. Why go into debt? Borrowing money from china, japan, south korea, when we have the constitutional authority to protect our economic sovereignty and to assure america's long-term fiscal health. Increasing taxes and cutting spending will not work because the debt keeps ballooning with compounded interest. It's time for a new policy. Reforms outlined in the hr 2990. Let's regain control of america's destiny. 
>> SENATOR mitch McConnell observed, quote, this shouldn't be the model for how we do things around here, end quote and the senate proceeded like a bull in a china closet anyway. The senate boasts it is america's deliberative body. Today that claim rings hollow. Mr. Speaker, the house must postpone the vote until congress and the american people have time to study and evaluate this extraordinarily complex legislation and impact on taxes, economy, debt and other issues. It is bettor get it right than to act in haste. Mr. Speaker, if we vote on the senate fiscal cliff bill today i will vote against it because it's not the way to do the people's business. 

[00:27:24]


>> What is he talking about? The senate deal addressing the fiscal cliff, hanging in t balance because it goes to the republican controlled house. What's in the senate's compromise. It would prevent middle class income taxes from going up but raise rates on income of more than $400,000 a year for individuals or more than $450,000 for couples. Unemployment benefits for 2 million americans would be extended for a year. It does not address spending cuts. That of course, lawmakers planning to revisit that issue. That's going to happen a couple of months from now. There's a two-month delay when it comes to dramatic spending cuts put out as part of the fiscal cliff. The stock market is closed for today of course it's a holiday. We don't know how wall street will react. But we have a feeling and a sense of how you are responding. Alison kosik at a diner in new york. I imagine if you talk to folks they are really frustrated with this thinking, why would you wait until the very last minute? This is something that impacts all of us. What are they telling you? 
>> Reporter: There are lots of opinions, yeah. We're in new york city where people don't hold back their opinions. What happen's great about the diner, we're getting opinions from across the country. Liz here from maine all I have to do is say the words fiscal cliff, what comes to mind? 
>> It's not a cliff, it's a slope. 
>> Reporter: Meaning? 
>> It's not a huge deal. It's not going to be like this disastrous event. It's just not. IT'S NOT GOING TO AFFECT ME06u Personally. I'm a graduate student. I get paid by state of indiana for my assistantship. It's not going to affect me. It's not going to affect a vast majority of americans. 
>> Reporter: How do you think negotiations are going? There as far as I know, they're not happening. I don't know. 
>> Reporter: How does that make you feel? You vote. You know, lawmakers knew that this deadline was coming. How does that make you feel? 

[00:29:24]


>> They shouldn't have been on vacation like that. The president came back from hawaii in order to get this done. They didn't puall out early enough, what I understand. They didn't get them back here early enough to deal with this. 
>> Reporter: It is a big challenge here to go ahead and pass all of the -- these parts of the legislation, right? 
>> I guess so. I mean, just let somesv of the tax cuts expire and let others remain like it's not that hard. 
>> Reporter: So lots of opinions. Suzanne? 
>> What would you say? I mean is there a consensus here? Are most people feeling like it's no big deal? Are people engaged? Are they watching what is happening in washington? Do they understand how it impacts them? 
>> Reporter: You know, they don't understand the minute details. It's hard unless you're following every day. Today's a holiday, I'm getting a good gauge on wh a lot of people think about it. They have strong opinions about whether or not lawmakers have dragged their feet and whether or not they should have dragged them as long as they did. Also getting great international perspectives. I ran into matt from australia. Wuf you've been watching negotiations from afar. Your take? 
>> I think a lot of it is emotionally charged hot air that a lot of people are getting upset over things that aren't really as big or as impactful as they are making it out to be. I come from australia, we have higher taxes and more expensive goods and services. And even if the fiscal cliff did occur, australia would still have higher taxes and higher goods and services. But we are doing okay. You know, what they are talking about with the lawmakers and the disions at the moment, they're trying to fight off something that, to be honest, is not going to be a big impact to the everyday working man or woman. 

[00:31:29]


>> Reporter: That's the international -- one international perspective on what's going on. I'm sitting here in the tick tock diner. The clock continues ticking, done it? 
>> Certainly does. Good to see people out and about having a good time but clearly paying attention as well. We are also following another story. Learning new details about secretary hillary clinton's blood clot as well as treatment. . 

[00:34:14]


>>> We know secretary of state hillary clinton's blood clot is located between her brain and her skull and behind her right ear. Doctors are treating her with blood thins are and expect her to make a full recovery. Dr. Sanjay gupta look house serious the blood clot is. 
>> Specifically, where the blood clot is located, remember, before we knew that she had a blood clot she was getting blood thinning medication and we could surmise from that that the blood clot itself wasn't located on top of the brain because if it was pushing on the brain, blood-thinning medication would worsen that, make that pressure on the brain even worse. Let me show you by way of model. This is on the right side of her head but I'll show you the left side of the head for the model. You have the brain. If the clot was pushing on the brain you wouldn't give blood thinning medication. In this case the blood clot is located in one of the blood vessels inside the brain, a vessel that drains blood away from the brain. It's the sinus here. In her case it's actually in this area here, the transrers sinus, again on the right side of her brain. This is a rare condition. Something that doesn't happen often. But it needs to be treated with blood-thinning medications to try to make that clot dissolve. Here's the concern, you have blood going to the brain. That blood needs to leave the brain. If the blood's not leaving the brain, the pressure in the brain can start to build up and that's what you don't want to happen. Most likely, you know, in the secretary's case, they need to get another scan at some point to actually show that the clot, the blood clot inside that blood vessel, has in fact gone away. Doctors very important to point out, they've said she's had no stroke, which is a potential complication. She's had no neurological impact whatsoever. I've heard from sources that if you were to see her you wouldn't know this problem's going on. A rare occurrence, cebral venus thrombosis it's called, treated with blood thinners. As we get more information, we'll bring it to you. Back to you. 

[00:36:27]


>> Thank you. Back to the fes. One thing is certain, for the vast majority of americans those is more than a political battle. This is a fht over your bottom line. 
>> My message to all of washington for the new year is set partisanship aside working on behalf of 100% of voters, fix the mess you've gotten us into, bring a balances budget to the table to grow the economy for the long term, not the short term. dad!

>>> Taking a look there on the house floor as people are debating the best way avoid the fiscal cliff. This on the house side today, because we went through this on the senate side. They came up with a plan that both democrats and republicans overwhelmingly agreed on to avoid the fiscal cliff. But of course, we went over that fiscal cliff because you don't have something on the house side. And they need to figure out if they're going to amend what the senate has decided on, whether they're going to scrap it altogether, come up with something new or sign on to it. A lot of debate taking place there. The vice president this hour is meeting with the democrats of the house to make sure that they're all on board as well. Here's what we are hearing from some of the house republicans and democrats. Let's listen in. 
>> I am a no vote. Until we see details, I'll say most folks a presume member of congress have details, we haven't seen anything. We're reading media reports. Nothing on any websites. . Looks like a no. Looks like the typical insider deal for washington, d.C. Where they get 89 votes in the senate but at the end of the day our debt's going to get big, spending's going up, taxes will increase and americans will be upset at washington. 
>> There's still a question as to whether amendments are offered here, and of course, as you've also noted, the big question here that having circumvented the dangers of the cliff here at new year's, that we soon face the valentine day cliff and perhaps the april fools' day cliff because all of the things not in the agreement. 
>> The president cannot and should not add about $11 billion to the deficit by the stroke of a men, by an executive order at a time in which he's negotiating to try to raise taxes to earn maybe another $60 billion, $70 billion, at most. 
>> Also following other top stories. For the first time in 19 years, north korea's leader makes a televised new year's speech.

Ambassador chris stevens in benghazi, libya, word of a specific threat to another american envoy, in another arab country where al qaeda is dangerously strong. A bounty of $160,000 worth of gold has been placed on gearld feierstein, the u.S. Ambassador to yemen. According to site intelligence group which monitors jihadists on the internet the bounty announced in audio clips and screen graphs posted by militants. We can't verify the clips' authenticity but the u.S. And yemeni governments are taking them seriously. Militants offered $23,000 for the killing of an american soldier in yemen. Analysts say militants may be affiliated with al qaeda in the arabian peninsula, the powerful bran inch yemen. 
>> They've been looking for a way to hit the u.S., Whether the u.S. Ambassador in yemen which they attacked in september of 2008 or carrying out more attacks here in the united states. 
>> Reporter: This is the same group that came close to detonating a bomb in the underwear of a militant in the 2009 christmas day plot to the bomb an airliner bound for detroit.

>> They have a mini green zone, all of the people who work in the embassy live within a secure corridor and travel from this secure housing location to the embassy and back and forth and they don't really get out, which makes them very, very difficult targets. 
>> Reporter: But one deadly asset that al qaeda in yemen has may tip the balance. That that's this man, the young master bombmaker for al qaeda in the arabian peninsula. He was behind that christmas day attack three years ago, and the printer bomb plot. He once placed a bomb inside the body of his own brother which came close to killing a top saudi official. He's still at large and able to train others on his techniques. Brian todd, cnn, washington.

>> Reporter: The couple is promoting healthy, sustainable living as they set off to cover more than 15,000 kilometers around the country and raise money for various charities but they haven't always been in fine form. 20 years ago, I wouldn't be able to run one city block. I couldn't run more than 100 meters. Since then I've lost 50 pounds and just feel so much better.

She believes eating raw vegan food saved her life and the pair will rely on that diet to fuel the 365 marathons. In new zealand in 2000 they ran 50 marathons in 50 days. This year holds a far greater challenge for the duo. Day one, 42 kilometers down, still thousands to go. 

[00:59:44]


>> Wow. Amazing. We'll see how they do. Impressive. Best of luck to both of them. 
>>> I'm suzanne malveaux. Happy new year. Many of you celebrating start of 2013, lawmakers in washington are struggle noug to reach a deal. 13 hours after the deadline for agreement on fiscal cliff, you've got house republicans, they are set to start their meeting about now. Democrats in the house, they have been meeting with the vice president to talk about this as well. He was, of course, instrumental in getting the senate deal passed. That happened in the wee hours of the morning. Bottom line here is what did that agreement look like? It would prevent middle class income taxes from going up. But would raise rates on the income of more than 400,000 a year for individuals or more than 450,000 for couples. Unemployment benefits for 2 million americans would be extended for a year. What it doesn't address is the spending cuts, controversial spending cuts. Lawmakers plan to revisit that issue two months from now. All eyes today right now are on the house for its vote. Dana bash live from capitol hill. Now, dana, first of all, I want dwru explain for us we know there are two things happening, the republicans who are meeting and we know the vice president is meeting with the democrats. When do we expect these two sides to get together and make a decision about whether or not they like what the senate has put forward or whether they want to come up with something else or amend it. 
>> Reporter: Before I answer that, I'm standing right near the house republican meeting which going to start in a few minutes and I might have to duck away. We're waiting for the house speaker to come by. 
>> Sure. 
>> Reporter: But to answerer that question, what's going to happen, we are told, is that the house republicans, of course, run the house, and they make the decision on when votes are, they are having the meeting right now, but we're told that that is not going to be the definitive or decisive meeting to decide when the vote will be on the fiscal cliff package and how they're going to vote on it, whether offer any amendments. That won't happen until another meeting later this afternoon after members have a chance to digest whatever they hear right now. So, that's the state of play in terms of how things could come to be when it comes to the process. With regard to what's going on in another part of the capital now, joe biden is meeting with democrats because a big part of the issue is whether or not, as you alluded to, both sides can gather together enough votes, leaders of both parties get together enough votes to pass this in the house. House democrat -- still operating under the 112th congress, the last congress. The new one won't be sworn in until later this week. Republicans have a healthy majority, even if there is significant number of democrats who vote for this, you know, they're going to need many republicans to cross over. And so what they're doing now with the democrats is that joe biden's trying to convince his own members not to break off because there are a lot of liberals who simply don't like this either and say they don't like the idea, for example, of keeping tax cuts in place for americans and households making up $450,000. They think that's simply too high. 

[01:03:19]


>> We'll be watching closely. Obviously going to come back to you as the developments warrant. A lot is taking place behind the scenes. Of course in front of the cameras as well as they play out their own version trying to come up with something to avert the fiscal cliff. The senate did make a decision, came up with a plan but of course the house has to come up with its own plan and somehow these two sides have to get together, cobble something together the president can sign. Want to bring in our own wolf blitzer in washington. The first thing here, you've got speaker boehner and he's meeting with the republican caucus on the house side. How effective is he in really getting his team on board? I mean when he had that modest -- more modest plan, plan b, he couldn't get his own party to sign off on that. Is he a powerful leader in the republican party to get them on board for anything? 
>> I think he will show that strength assuming he has eric CANTOR ON BOARD, kevin McCarthy, some of the other young guns, as they lake to call themselves, in the house of representatives. The or young republican leaders. If he can get all of them together, he's not photog bring in all of the tea party activists in the republican caucus gu together with the democrats who will support him this time and the republicans that could cobble together the 218 votes they need, they have to do this, suzanne, today or tomorrow because at noon on thursday, the 113th congress is sworn in. That's a new congress, new senate, new house of representatives. They have to start from scratch. The legislation that passed in the middle of the night last night, that's going to have to be passed once again in the senate if they don't get this done before thursday at noon. Remember, tomorrow's a regular day on wall street. Markets are opening tonight on the east coast of the united states, the asian markets will be opening. People will be watching closely to see if there's stability, if there's continuity, a disrupt tur, and the great fearing of course the house of representatives doesn't follow the senate's lead and passes legislation that the president will immediately sign into law. There could be a breakdown in all of that. Taxes will go up on everyone, spending cuts imposed, sequestration, mandatory defense, domestic spending cuts will go into feick and that could be a major dislocation on the world markets. 

[01:05:43]


>> Let's talk about that. You know the formal te sequestration but it's about the massive cuts $110 billion of spending cuts. That is something that they kicked the can on for two months or so. So could we actually see ourselves going through a similar process here when we have the negotiations over the debt ceiling? 
>> Yes, we definitely will see a similar, if not more intense and bitter process in two months or so, at end of february or march when that debt ceiling has to be raised. The president has made it clear, he will not negotiate on that. I don't know exactly what he means. He's not poeing to let that come up as an issue. But in order for the debt ceiling to go up the senate and the house have to pass legislation raising the debt ceiling and it's clear the republicans, at least the house of representatives, many of them, want to use that debt ceiling as leverage on the president to get what they want, namely, much more significant spending cuts, especially entitlements, medicare, social security, making major reforms or changes down the road and domestic programs. They don't want to see cuts in defense spending. So there will be a huge battle at the end of february or march when that debt ceiling comes up once again. 
>> Thanks. We'll be watching closely. Want to get the nuts and bolt of the plan as it stand stands now. Christine, first of all, you know there's a lot to go through. But essentially there are some folks who are spared from the tax increases but there are -- there are tax goodies, credited, all kinds of things that happened. Go through what it means for most of us, most americans on the senate side. 
>> So it means the status quo for 98% of americans, right? It means that your tax rates won't go up, for doctors, they won't have a real big cut to how much they're getting for reimbursement from medicare, right. 

[01:07:48]


>> It means for the jobless, they're still going to be able to get a jobless check if you're on extended unemployment benefits. For 2 million people that ran OUT DECEMBER 29th. If the senate and now of course the house, if they don't do an extension of federal unemployment benefits you're going to see a lot of people not have 100,000s for the jobless checks. Another 1 million people facing end of state benefits in the beginning part of the year wouldn't be able to get federal benefits. 98% of people will get the status quo, the continuation of the billing as it is right now, and for working americans, continuation, of course, of their pay rates. One thing that's -- their tax rates. One thing important to note, tax rates aren't going up you could see a smaller paycheck. The payroll tax holiday, that wasn't going to survive the fiscal cliff we all knew it but you're going to have a smaller paycheck, $10,$15, $20 less, so planner to that. 
>> This is folks making between $250,000, $400,00 that the taxes are not going to change but could be paying higher taxes because of other things that happened and that has to to with iteing deductions when you file for tax returns. 
>> Absolutely right. So remember the president initially said that he wanted to raise taxes on the rich? People who make $250,000 a year or higher. In the end he raised -- they're trying to raise taxes on people who make $400,000 and higher. But they're going to limit itemized deductions, personal exemptions for individuals earning more than 250 and households more than 300. Tax rates could stay the same for the people but if you limit deducts they could have a higher tax bill and that will get riv knew, too. 
>> When you look at the senate plan4 are there winners and losers overall, big picture? 

[01:09:52]


>> Winners or losers I look through and see compromise. I see compromise in the estate tax. I see compromise there. I see a win for the president but also see a big win for republicans because the amount of exempt estate -- of the size of estate exempt is pretty big. Look, I look out at this and see peril because you look at the house, you have to get through the house part of the process, don't you. 
>> And that's something that's still an unknown here. We're beginning that process right now. I look at the markets, how the markets could react, and you know, I mean the markets are expecting a resolution, investors are expecting a resolution if you get some sort of setback in the house the LOSER'S YOUR 401(k), MARKET Stability. I think people, members of congress, some of them I have talked to, fresh in the memory 2008 when they didn't pass the bank bailout and markets went haywire. They have the markets closed today. A house looking at this now. They're trying to avoid that. 
>> And a new congress coming in on thursday. We'll be watching all of this. As christine points out here, some people look at the 11th hour compromise in the senate as a win for the president. But what's going to happen if the house actually sends the deal back? Live to the white house next. I'm having one right now. I don't want to be disturbed. And I won't. Because before I went to sleep, I set this. Now my iphone knows not to ring, unless its important. 'Cause disturbing this would just be .. wrong. ] day news starts with arthritis pain and a choice.

[01:13:31]


>>> It took until the wee hours of the monthing but the senate passed the fiscal cliff deal by 89-8. Now it's up to the house to seal the deal. Want to bring in jessica yellin at the white house. The vice president meeting with the house democrats, very instrumental when he was working with the minority leader, mitch McCONNELL. What's his relationship with the democrats on the house side? 
>> Reporter: Well, he's sort of uncle joe, if you'll -- if you will. He's the guy who sort of shoots from the hip, sayst like it is, that's his reputation. And who can take incoming fire. If there's sort of decorum around the president where people are uncomfortable by speaking to honestly in front of him and the president has to be more careful about what he says, it's a different dynamic when joe goes up to the hill. So you couldxpect this to be a quite frank exchange where people who are angry will let him know it and there are progressives who think, as always, that the white house just gave away way too much in this deal, they gave up their leverage to negotiate the debt ceiling, should have included a debt ceiling component to this, they shouldn't have let the tax rate be set so high, et cetera. I'm sure he'll hear all about that. Moderate also have other issues and he'll make the case from the white house why they took this deal and why it sets the white house, in their view, up, democrats up, for an effective hand as they continue their fight. The one thing about the vice president is, sometimes when he goes to these meetings he says things that are colorful and they leak out. It's been surprising that this has been very low profile. We have not heard any leaks during this whole negotiation. 
>> There is a rare discipline coming from the white house now. Do we have a sense of what the president's role has been in the vice president and president obama are in constant discussions or is he giving him more wiggle room here? 

[01:15:34]


>> Reporter: The president has been very -- my sources say the president's been very clear about what he will and will not accept in this in deal. But he is not the one on the PHONE WITH senator McConnell because the vice president and McCONNELL HAVE THIS HISTORIC Relationship. McCONNELL LIKES WORKING WITH THE Vice president and biden called the McColinle whisperer, whoever that really means. It means he can get stuff done. The president, for example, I'm told in the late night oval office pow wow that went until 2:00 a.M. I believe it was sunday night if I can get my days straight, made it clear in a discussion with the vice president and staff that hf just would not accept a deal if it did not include this postponement of the spending cuts. Had to be a paydown on $24 billion of the deficit. We'll have two months to argue out the debt ceiling and the sequester. That was a bright line the president laid out to vice president biden and the staff, said that had to be in the deal, or no deal. 
>> Might be too early, too soon, any read out, any sense of how the meeting's gone between the vice president and the house democrats or we're still working on that? 
>> Reporter: I am not getting any -- any read-out yet because I think it's ongoing. But I will tell you that there is -- even going into it -- a sense of optimism here. The staffers who were working well past 2:00 a.M. Last night still have not booked their vacation -- well, they have not left on vacation but I think they're approaching the point where they might feel comfortable booking their vacation travel for a few days. You get the sense they think this is going to wrap up. 
>> Strange how we get our information. We have to look at people's travel and vacation plans. But, yes, it could give us an inkling we're getting close to the in. 

[01:17:36]


>> Reporter: Still hard at work here. 
>> Thanks. Vice president, as jessica mentioned meeting with house democrats to discuss the fiscal cliff. We are going to hear from one member of congress who is part of the meetings, representative john yarmouth. So, umwhoever's fathered the most children, gets the most data. Let's just do it by hair.

>>> Critical moment for the financial future of the country, the deadline for the dreaded fiscal cliff. It passed at midnight. Right now house republicans are not prepared to vote on the compromise approved by the senate. The vice president, he was instrumental in getting the senate deal passed. So he went back to capitol hill to meet with the house democrats. Congressman john yarmuth of kentucky among those who met with the vice president. Thank you for joining us. We understand that you actually left that meeting that the vice president was holding with your colleagues to talk with us a little bit about what is taking place. What is the push coming from the vice president today? What is he saying about the deal that was made on the senate side? 
>> Well, suzan, I think what he's been trying to do, and true to his image, he has been going on for some time with the democratic caucus, but he has gone through the elements of the deal point by point, explaining what the options were, where the republicans might have had some give, and where the white house wanted to remain absolutely steadfast. I think my impression, as I left that meeting and he had gone through pretty much the entire deal, there's no way that we could have gotten any deal if a democratic perspective that it was -- that was more supportive of our values than the deal that has been negotiated. 
>> What were the points that he said the white house essentially had to have as part of that package, part of that deal, where they would not move? 
>> Well, one of the ones, for instance, extension of unemployment benefits for one year. The republicans apparently wanted to extend them just until -- just for 60 days to correspond to the other this that had been delayed but not extended for longer. The white house held out very strongly for year's worth of extension of unemployment benefits. Similarly the issues such as earned income tax credit, the child tax credit and affordable opportunity ability tuition credits, was something that the republicans didn't want to extend. Some of them at all. They basically said, we'll give u one of them, one of the three, and and they were very strong in saying, no we want all three and they extended them for five years. So there were a number of things, and of course there were issues with regard to the threshold. That was a significant issue, republicans wanted to go to 500,000 and the white house was very, very strong and said they would not go to 500,000. 

[01:22:47]


>> Did the vice president say there was anything from the house side that was negotiatable, anything they would be willing to let go of in order for the senate and house to come together? 
>> I'm not sure there was anything that was -- that they would let go of. Some of the issues that where they really couldn't find agreement or too complicated, such as what you do with the sequester, across the board spending cuts, were pushed down a couple of months. It sounded to me as if the vice president pretty much was able to negotiate everything that the democrats wanted. At the outset, he stressed very strongly that things like changing the way we calculate social security benefits, the so-called chained cpi off the table to begin with and he was very clear with senator McCONNELL, APPARENTLY AT OUTSET If these things such as the chained cpi were part of the discussion that there was no reason wasting either of their time. So, I think they took care of those items right at the outset. 
>> Did he say, did he encourage when you guys should vote on this? Did he say get this thing done today? 
>> He hadn't while I was in the meeting. I think the republicans are meeting, their conference is meeting right now. It looks like, from all we can tell, that they're going to not enforce the so-called hastert rule where they are to have a majority of majority to get to the floor. Speaker boehner is willing to bring this to the floor. It's also my understanding, speaking to some of my colleagues who ha spoken to republicans, it's twice removed some republicans in the senate left and told republican leadership don't send us anything but what we sent you. So it looks like there will be a vote, my guess, sometime later today, at worst tomorrow morning. But I think we're going to get this done. 
>> And finally, you said he did much of the talking, typical biden style doing a lot of the talking there. Did he get an earful from some of your colleagues or yourself, people who might be frustrated the white house compromised a little too much? 

[01:24:59]


>> He was still talking when i left. He had not opened the floor for questions. I'm sure there are a few members who are going to be upset. I know there are a number who felt that we gave far too much on the revenue side, that wanted to stick with that the original 250,000 threshold to increase taxes on the very wealthiest americans. But I think he made a compelling case as to why that was not possible and why this was essentially a very good deal which provides a lot of revenue toward deficit reduction. 
>> Two questions here. Are you willing to support the senate deal? Do you feel that's a fairay going forward? Do you think rest of your colleagues on the democratic side would do the same? 
>> I'm -- I strongly support it. I think it is a good deal. And nan many of the principles included are things I've been talking about for weeks now. I think the overwhelming majority of the caucus will support the plan but some have to swallow hard to do it, i think they'll still vote for it. 
>> Get back in that meeting. Come out a fill us in again. Let us know if there's any fireworks or anything else that comes out of it. Is a deal or no deal? Some american people not sounding happy with members of congress getting business done. 
>> I think it's sad that we pay politicians to protect our country and our interests and that they've ignored us. ???????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????? ?????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????? ?????? ?????? aww man.

>>> The stoechl is closed today, new year's day but we don't know how wall street will react to the senate deal on a fiscal cliff. Alison kosik at a new york city diner. Still waiting for the house to come up with its own version. What do we make of what folks think about what's been put on the table here, at least preventing some middle class folks from their taxes going up? 
>> Reporter: We certainly are having great conversations with a lot of people at this particular diner. They're having breakfast. Food looks great. We're having great conversations here at the tick tock diner. Couldn't think of a more fitting place, tick tock diner, get it clock continues ticking on the fiscal cliff. It is a great pun? Very fitting. A lot of people talking about frustrations and what their thoughts are about how congress has handled this whole fiscal cliff situation. I want to talk with kelly about that. You have strong thoughts about how congress has handled this. What are your thoughts? 

[01:30:11]


>> I do. I think it's really hard and they keep doing this over and over again. Last year the debt ceiling. This year it's the fiscal cliff. And it just seems like they can't get their act together year after year. It's frustrating to sit here and, you know, watch it happen over and over again. Especially we're all students so it affects us a lot. It's really frustrating. 
>> Julie, do you see yourself maybe changing your mind about who you necily vote for in the next election based on how members of congress handled the situation? 
>> Actually no. I feel a lot of this has come from the partisanship which is creating the gridlock. I think the far right of the republican party's holding congress hostage to a poi. mitch McConnell sayse wants to strike a deal. Think about it, history states they've been the party of no. He said from the beginning if obama wants it, why are we going to do it? At the end of the day congress can sit around but these directly affect us. As students, think about the division tax breaks, things will go away and affect my family. Within I look at congress, I see it's shifted to one side. I don't know. I feel like they need to step up and make a compromise. With obama it's like a mandate, with the taxing the wealthiest americans, if he's elected which by a landslide, maybe theyd to catch up and form and modernize the party. 
>> Reporter: How much does the political posturing, how is that to watch this churn day after day for the past several days? 
>> It's rough. I was watching yesterday when the president spoke, hoping maybe they had come to some point. Hearing him say we're close but not theryet, it's like these are things that directly affect americans and if this is your job, this in is why we elect you, it's waiting each day, it's kind of like -- it's cliff, though cliff is a misleading term it is a good term. It's like jumping over, waiting for something to kind of hit us, that really shouldn't be there at all. 

[01:32:14]


>> Reporter: Thanks for your thoughts. One other person I talked with had one more thought saying it's a shame na the u.S. Economy is being held hostage by the u.S. Congress. Something to think about as we continue our new year's day. 
>> It was fascinating to hear that young woman's point of view there. Obviously students and paying close attention. Do you get that sense for most people where you are they are following this and understand how this really affects them? 
>> Reporter: I think they do. I also sort of took a mini poll about what -- this wasn't directly related with the fiscal cliff but the payroll tax holiday, going away. A lot of people I talked with, they were discussing with me where they're going to cut back starting this year because the payroll tax holiday is going away. They're discussing what changes to make in their own budget. It's not just the fiscal cliff because many people are also sort of, you know, sort of looping in the payroll tax holiday to that as well. But as far as the fiscal cliff goes they don't know the minute details, they have a better understanding of the over all ck and forth that's been going on. The majority of people are saying they're frustrated. They know congress is hard at work during the holidays and hard at work overnight they understand that. But at the same time lots of people tell me congress knew this deadline was coming and they did wait for the last minute. More many voters, they're frustrated. 
>> You're absolutely right. A lot of people who work hard all year round on the weekend, stay up late, they expect the representatives to do the same. Thank you very much.

>>> deal or no deal. We asked you to weigh in on the fiscal cliff debate. Here what happens some of you had to say. Listen in in my new year's message to washington, this entire fiscal cliff problem isn't just an isolated incident. It's representative of how partisanship and polarization have taken over congress. I'm 18. I used to be excited for the future. But I don't want to live in a country that doesn't have a successful working legislator. Congress, it's time for you to remember what your purpose really is, get back to doing your job. 
>> Resolution for washington is to get out of the middle east, learn to live on a budget like every other american does, and third thing is to reform the tax code.

>>> All right. New year, bunch of new laws went into effect, 400 actually. We'll tell you about them. Some are strange, others not so much. But let's start off with illinois middle school students must learn how to use a defibrillator. It is illegal to possess or sell shark fins in the state. And it's a felony for sex offenders to dress up as santa claus or the easter bunny. Also can't hand out candy at halloween. Go to california. See what they've got on their books now employers there can't require employees or job applicants to disclose their social media passwords. Illinois passes a similar measure, by the way.

>>> Civil rights activists CONVICTED IN A 1970s FIREBOMBING Have been pardoned 40 years later by north carolina's governor. It includes benjamin chavis. Tell us, first of all, remind us of the wilmington ten, what they were accused of. 
>> Justice for the wilmington ten, but only six are l alive. Go back to 1971, after the desegregation of schools in wilmington, north carolina. The black high school in that city was shut down, there were boycotts, protests, and ben chavis, a reverend -- still a reverend, called in to quell some violence. One night of rioting a white-owned supermarket was firebombed. Chavis, eighher black males and a white female seeing on the screen now were convicted of arson and conspiracy and sentenced to a combined 282 years. No one was killed in the fire but convicted. And a few years later, one of the witnesses recanted his story from the trial and said that he was coerced and bribed, others did the same. Their convictions were overturned and they were released after about eight years. Just yesterday, north carolina governor bev perdue pardoned them and gave them a pardon of innocence. Here's part of what she said. Convictions represent an ugly stain on north carolina's justice system that cannot be allowed to stand any longer. Again, four of the wilmington ten have since died before they saw that statement from north carolina's governor. 
>> Why did it take so long? 
>> It happened because, after probably 25, 30 years some notes were found and pass therom the naacp, the state chapter of north carolina, to an historian. He flipped through and saw the prosecutor w ran the jury selection had written notes next to jury numbers, one that said kkk, good. Another uncle tom type and another one, so, she associates with negros and that happened just this summer. Also with ben chavis handing over 130,000 signatures for a petition to have them pardoned as innocent but relatives those who passed away one one of the wilmington ten say the past 40 years have been a ghtmare. 

[01:47:36]


>> It has not been easy when the fellows will go look for jobs they were turned down. Ostracized. People talked about them. Even our own family, the wholen community did not stand together. 
>> They're convinced in their own minds, heart, that somebody did it, you know? I mean, we were chosen victims of crimes that we didn't commit. 
>> Governor perdue's historic action today doesn't remove the past 40 years of injustice against ten innocent american citizens. 
>> And they've not found who actually firebombed that supermarket. 
>> Victor, thank you very much. 
>>> Secretary of state hillary clinton being treated with blood thinners for a blood clot that doctors discovered behind her right ear. It is in a vein between her brain and her skull. Doctors say it did not cause a stroke or any neurological damage. They expect clinton to make a full recovery. Dr. Sanjay gupta takes a look at what some concerns are. 
>> Let me show you here by way of model. This is on the right side of the head but for the demonstration I'm going to show you left side of the head for the model. You have tbrain. If the clot was pushing on the brain you wouldn't give blood thinning medication. In this case the blood clot located in one of the blood vessels inside the brain a blood vessel that drains blood away from the brain. It's called the sinus here. In her case it's actually in this area here, the transverse sinus, on right side of the brain. It's a rare condition. This is something that doesn't happen often but needs to be treated with blood thinning medications to try to make that clot dissolve. Here's the concern. You have blood going to the brain. That blood also needs to leave the brain. If that blood is not leaving the brain, the pressure on the brain can start to build up and that's what you don't want to happen.

I'm having one right now. I don't want to be disturbed. And I won't. Because before I went to sleep, I set this. Now my iphone knows not to ring, unless its important. 'Cause disturbing this would just be .. wrong. 2012, bad year for weather disasters. And the united states alone disasters killed 349 people, caused billions of dollars in damage, and worldwide thousands were killed in flooding and severe cold weather. Here is a look at back at the impact throughout the year. 

[01:53:01]


>> Well, people in the philippines dealing with some of the worst flooding they have seen in a lifetime. More than half of the capital manila underwater now. 
>> Drenching monsoon rain triggered widespread flooding. Desperate and difficult evacuations are now under way. 
>> The main concern right now in this area is getting these people to higher ground. As the floodwaters are rising and more rain is in the forecast. As you can see, this shantytown is completely submerged in water. You have people in boats trying to pick valuables out of this debris. That is just being swept through this fast-moving current of water. 
>> We have been measuring the rainfall across manila. No longer in centimeters, but in feet. Another foot of rain fell in the manila area in the last 24 hours. Unfortunately there is more rain to come. 
>> Floodwaters rise in southern russia, sweeping through houses as people swept, unaware and vulnerable. Officials say one town actually got two months of rain in 24 hours. Another town, five months' worth. And etar tass news agency says in one community, floodwaters rose seven meters, 23 feet overnight. 
>> The floodwaters have receded from thestreets. But as they have receded they have revealed a scene of absolute devastation. 
>> Russian officials are calling it the worst disaster in the region in a decade. Several districts have been declared emergency zones. 
>> And people wandering around in a state of shock. 
>> Officials say at least 171 people were killed. 
>> When we went to the town mortuary earlier on, there wasn't enough space in the mortuary for all the bodies and the local supermarkets have had to mend refrigerated trucks for help with the backlog of dealing with all of those bodies. 

[01:55:14]


>> State media reports more than 5,000 homes were overrun, disrupting the lives of 12,000 people. 
>> Buildings have literally been smashed to pieces. A lot of wood and destruction here. They have been ripped to pieces. Unfortunately a lot of them with people still inside. 
>> There is a lotf anger at the government from ordinary people. 
>> As the recovery operation gets under way, residents are demanding to know why they were not given adequate warning. 
>> A mandatory evacuation order in effect. 
>> The fact that some decided to disregard my instruction, my order, and I'm concerned that it might lead to the loss of life. 
>> It is on the way to landfall, probably just a few hours from now. 
>> The wind field is bigger than a category 1. The surge will be bigger that be a category 1. 
>> This should all be sandy coastline now. But now it is a foamy, brown messf atlantic angry ocean, thanks to hurricane sandy. 
>> We did begin an orderly shutdown of the subway system at 9:00. 
>> There is a ship presently out at the mercy of the ocean, a ship with 17 people on board. 
>> Sandy is forcing both campaigns and some boaters to make some changes. 
>> Anything they need, we will be there. And we're going to cut through red tape. 
>> We are seeing a large number of fires caused by downed wires and electrical problems relating to outages. 
>> Flooding on fdr drive on the east side. On the lower east side of manhattan we have seen flooding number of subway stations as well, water pouring down. 
>> Make no mistake about it, this was a devastating storm, maybe the worst we have ever experienced. 
>> Hurricane sandy's impact on the united states has been devastating and heart breaking. And the response has been heroic and inspiring. 

[01:57:19]


>> So why was 2012 such a bad year for weather disasters? What can we expect in the new year? Chad myers joins us to talk about this and we saw really quite impactful that hurricane sandy and a lot of talk about the possibility of these super storms in the future, more of them. Do we suspect that is something we're going to see this year? 
>> Maybe not this year, but certainly in the coming decades we will see the strength of storms be more impacting of people along the coast and where people live. We're putting more people in harm's way now. Let's say hurricane sandy hit in 1900. Certainly would have done a lot of damage. But wouldn't have affected really the tens of millions of people. Wouldn't have done the hundreds probably by the time it is done worth of billions worth of dollars worth of damage because there wasn't that much property. Not that many people there. But now that we all want to live along the coast, we all want to live in beautiful places and many times beautiful places are the places that are in the most danger. We're going to see in 2013 the persistence of the big drought. The drought is still out here in the midwest. It is not going anywhere. For the next three months, forecasters are saying there is not going to be that much rain. That's not atypical of what a drought is. Once the ground is dry, suzanne, there is no evaporation there. No more humidity in the air above that ground because it is just parched land. So there is no humidity to make clouds, no clouds, no rain. So that is just that snowballing effect that we see here. Will there be bigger storms in the future compared to the ones we saw 100 years ago? Yes, probably. The water is warmer. The arctic ocean doesn't have much ice in it. The lowest ice ever on record. The water temperature when hurricane sandy was there, two degrees warmer than it should have been. Did that make hurricane sandy bigger? Probably. 10% bigger, whatever it might be. If you're breaking records every year in 2012, it will go down as the warmest year every for the u.S. Then you know something is going on. And it is -- whether you believe it is man made or not and we do believe it is man made, partially, if every storm is 10% bigger than the last record storm, you're going to start to get people in danger, especially along the coastal communities. 

[01:59:34]


>> All right. We'll have to be mindful of that, protect ourselves. Chad, thank you. Good to see you. Happy new year.

=======================================================

Avoid an economic meltdown. Technically the nation went over the fiscal cliff when the new year began. But practically the senate pulled a parachute that should soften the fall. About 2:00 a.M. Eastern, senators passed a round of compromises with a vote of 89-8. I said should. This deal is far from done. Now it is up to the house to stop $600 billion of automatic tax hikes and spending cuts. At this hour, though, a vote is not scheduled. Multiple house members took to the floor today to say their vote will be no. 
>> The current agreement with the fiscal cliff was agreed to, we're told, somewhere around 11:30 last night. The bill was voted on at 2:00 in the morning. Now, again this is new year's eve. I don't know how many senators between midnight and 2:00 a.M. In the morning had a chance to thoroughly read this agreement that is 157 pages long. You see, this is not how we should run our government. This is drama. Unnecessary drama. 
>> So what did the senators pass? Well, I was very long bill, 157 pages. There are a host of tax credit extensions, medicare extensions, and a lot more. But here are some of the key points. Couples making $450,000 or more and individuals making $400,000 or more will see a higher tax rate of 39.6%. That is the rate from when bill clinton was president. Couples making $300,000 or more, they're going to have the cap on itemized deductions. Benefits for the long term unemployed, those will be extended. And the most criticized point, the senate plan, will delay the sequester, that's right, those big automatic spending cuts and taxes by two months. But over that same time period, the plan allows for $12 billion to be cut from government programs. Senior congressional correspondent dana bash is on capitol hill and, dana, does it even look like the house will vote today? Because that's kind of crucial. 

[00:02:11]


>> It is a big open question, deb. I can tell you the reason why I'm standing in front of a -- maybe not so pretty white wall is because I'm down the hall from where republicans are meeting as we speak. House republicans. And you can hear at different times some clapping and different times other -- maybe not so happy noises coming from inside the meeting, but they are discussing the way forward. And what we're hearing from sources, again,s meeting is going on what we're hearing from sources about what is happening behind the doors is that there are a lot of members concerned that they want spending cuts to go along with this deal. They don't want to just pass mostly -- mostly tax cuts but tax increases. That is a big part of what I'm hearing is going on. The other thing we're told is that the house speaker is simply not taking a position whether he is for or against this. He's being very cautious, we're told, in this meeting, with his members. Simply listening to ideas, laying out options, you know. One option that the speaker said publicly, even before we saw this senate vote, is that the house may take up the deal, may take up the bill, but then try to amend it in some way. We're waiting to see what they decide, but we should also note they're not going to decide anything out of the meeting. We're told clearly they're going to take into consideration what they hear from the members in this meeting, spend some time this afternoon discussing it inside the leadership. And then have another meeting later today to figure out how they're going it -- how they're going to move forward. And, of course, the question is whether or not there is going to be a late night vote tonight or maybe delay it. 
>> Dana, out of curiosity, there were eight senators who voted against this deal, is there a possibility that the republicans cannot rally and cannot get the kind of votes that they need to get this passed? Is that even a remote possibility? Or is it pretty much a done deal even though perhaps grudging done deal? 

[00:04:12]


>> Reporter: It is a remote possibility that they can't get the votes, absolutely. There is no question about it. Because, look, to get this, this -- first of all, the house speaker as you well know, the house is run in a very tight way, whether it is the democrats in charge or republicans, so the house speaker will be able to decide how he brings it to the floor. What kind of vote it is. So held decide right off the bat that, yes, he's going to bring it to the floor, which he promised to do, but he'll only do it as part of a process that also allows amendments, an amendment on adding spending cuts. That would -- if that passed, that would change the dynamic right away, it would go back over to the senate and they would have to decide how to deal with it. That's one potential option, but the answer to your question is it is definitely possible, even plausible, there aren't the votes here. Democrats, that's why there is a meeting still going on, deb, going on we think for two hours, meeting with the vice president in another part of the capital because he's trying to make sure the democrats are still in line because there are a lot of liberals also not happy with it. In fact, I'm told in my ear, joe biden just left that meeting. Just wrapped up. That's why both sides are trying to figure out where things stand. And it is obvious from what I'm saying it is very unclear. 
>> Sure. Clearly so much uncertainty, a ping-pong effect going back and forth. Interesting to see exactly how this turns out. But clearly still work to be done. Dana bash, thank you so much for all your work. 
>> Thanks, deb. 
>>> The political leaders who cut this deal call it imperfect and many members of congress on the floor today, democrat and republican, cannot have agreed more. 
>> A new year's deal for new year's day or groundhog day. Like the movie groundhog day, this government in two months will arrive at another crisis of debt, of spending and taxes. Our debt-based economics system with its exponential growth of debt due to compounded interest consigns us to massive unemployment, threats to the social safety net, a deteriorated infrastructure, a psychology of poverty amidst plenty. Austerity. Congress must regain its full power accorded under the constitution. 

[00:06:22]


>> Congress is addicted to spending money. Maybe congress should join spending anonymous. Here's the 12-step plan. One, congress should admit it is addicted to spending someone else's money. Two, make a list of the wasteful spending. Three, pass a yearly budget and a constitutional balanced budget amendment. Four, stop giving money to countries that hate us. Five, have the resolve not to spend money we don't have. Six, don't contribute to the addiction by taking more money away from americans. Seven, don't borrow any more money from china. Eight, don't make excuses for our addiction. Nine, don't blame others for the addiction. Ten, run congress like most people run their family budgets. 11, remember we are to do the will of the people. And, 12, have a support group and meet regularly to confess our addiction. 
>> What do we know about certainty with the bill that passed the senate? We know it has bipartisan support. That's encouraging. I'm a republican who has been making the case that revenues must rise. That bill does that and if it becomes law, it provides certainty to our tax code which would help our economy. Yet mr. Speaker, we also know a certainty it fails to address the mortal threat facing our country, uncontrolled spending. It fails to reflect the balanced approach that was advocated by our president. So we find ourselves again with a bill that reflects not financial wisdom, but the seductive spirit that pervades this town. 
>> We're going into a new year as the first generation who did not ask the question what can we do, what can we sacrifice to make future generations have a better life than we have. Instead, we ask how much can we eek up taxes a little bit so that we can keep spending, 58 cents, to get a dollar's worth of wasteful bloated government. So that our children and grandchildren can pay 42 cents of every dollar that we waste on ourselves. Is that any way to start the new year? We're taking up a bill that will not do anything to cut spending. I'm embarrassed for this generation. 

[00:08:40]


>> Clearly a lot of dissatisfaction on capitol hill. No matter what goes down there today, your taxes are going up. That's right. Well, for the majority probably not as much as you probably feared, but expect an increase in at least four areas. First, everyone will get hit with the social security payroll tax. It is going back up from 4.2% to 6.2%. So for a person with an annual income of $50,000, that would take about a thousand dollars a way. There is also a new medicare tax, close to 1% of income over 250 grand. That group will also pay nearly 4% more on dividends and capital gains from investments. And if you put money away in a flexible spending account for medical expenses, well, you're not going to be able to stash as much as you did last year. I'm going to turn to cnn's christine romans, host of your bottom line. And, christine, are we breathing maybe a premature sigh of relief here. 
>> I never breathe a sigh of relief, especially watching washington. Couple of things to remember here. We still have the house that is a really important hurdle here. The markets closed today. You have a house that has to deal with this. And then, you know, there is a punt if you will on the sequester. You got a lot of other thins decided going forward here. And you still have weeks, months, maybe years of difficult budget negotiations on getting our debt and deficits in order. Sigh of relief, I wouldn't necessarily breathe one just yet. What we know for sure is that your taxes, your tax rates on 98% of americans are not going to go up. Your tax rates will not go up on 98% of americans. We know doctors are breathing a sigh of relief. They're not going to -- they're not going to have to get a big cut in what their medicare reimbursement rates are. We know people on jobless benefits are breathing a sigh of relief. Beyond that, you point out the payroll tax holiday, it is important too. Most workers, almost all of the 160 million workers in america, will get a little less each week in the paycheck because that temporary payroll tax holiday is going away. 

[00:10:45]


>> Right. Certainly not as bad as most people expected given the uncertainty. At this point with no vote from the house, and you can see the podium there, that's where some republicans will come out and speak, with no vote from the house, it will be very difficult for millions of people this year to file their tax returns. Some folks not even knowing where to begin or over what period of timees are going to apply. 
>> One thing that is really important here is the amt patch. Looks like the senate part of this thing, they want to make -- they want to patch permanently the alternative minimum tax, so the called wealth tax. They want to patch that permanently. If the house picks that up and it happens quickly, you could see -- you could see that the tax refund season could go along as normal. Remember, according to the irs, you know, if they didn't approve a patch to the amt, they said up to 100 million taxpayers might not be able to file their returns or collect their refunds until late march. So, you know, by the deadline, of course, in april, but by late march, that's an awful lot of time the money is not working in the economy. It is important to get this fixed very, very quickly on that front, no question. 
>> And we talk about everything that is going on right now. Dana just said that in fact there is a distinct possibility that there may not be enough votes to pass this. How will investors react if, in fact, the house either doesn't vote, votes it down or amends it and it has to go back to the senate? How does the market react? 
>> The market -- the way the market stands right now, rally on the last trading day of the year, the anticipation was that this was going to get done, the progress in the senate was something that suggested there be progress to get this under way. Very good year in stocks last year. The s&p up 13%. Despite the fiscal cliff worries. And you got to see it get handled. If you saw the hou pass this, or you all of a sudden saw some controversy with amendments in the like and two competing versions of this bill and this drags on, I think you could see the stock market take a tumble and that's something members of congress have told us, they like to avoid that. They rep t.A.R.P. And the bank bailout and the stock market didn't like it when they didn't pass the bank bailout in first place, that's a fresh memory for them. 

[00:12:57]


>> Christine romans, thank you for keeping an eye on all of this. So much to keep an eye on, thanks 
>>> as we wait for republicans to speak, the vice president playing a huge role in getting this deal done. But does joe biden have the pull to actually get it through the house. 
>>> Plus, I'll speak live with the attorney for one of the very first pot clubs in colorado. Just opened after voters approved a new marijuana law. You can do two things at the same time. You can watch videos and text. Or you could watch the earnings report and take notes, like we're supposed to. So... can I get it? Yeah. Okay Either of you put together the earnings report? Yes, me totally. Why don't you tackle the next quarter while we go to lunch. Pu Pu platter? Yup! Keep up the good work. I will keep up the good work. Do more with the new Samsung Galaxy Note II. For a limited time get two flipcovers for the price of one. Exclusively at Verizon. ...so as you can see, GEICO's customer satisfaction is at Mmmm tasty. And cut! Very good. People are always asking me how we make these GEICO adverts. So we're taking you behind the scenes. This coffee cup, for example, is computer animated. It's not real. GEICO's customer satisfaction is quite real though. This computer-animated coffee tastes dreadful. GEICO. 15 minutes could save you 15 % or more on car insurance. Someone get me a latte will ya, please? 

[00:15:42]


>>> Well, marijuana smokers in denver have a new place to light up outside their homes. It is called club 64. And it is billed as a private pot smoking club. Back in november, colorado voters passed amendment 64 which legalized the recreational use of marijuana in a private space. With plenty of goldfish and cheetos on hand, club 64 opened its doors yesterday at 4:20 p.M. To start ringing in the new year. You can't buy marijuana there, but the $30 membership fee will get you a new place to light up. 
>> They said regulate like alcohol. This is where, you know, you can come and hang out and smoke instead of drink. 
>> It is great to be able to exercise my vote now, to be able to just get together with my common man and be able to express ourselves in our constitutional limit. 
>> Joining me live from denver is robert cory jr., The general counsel for club 64. Thank you for being with us. Is this so-called cannabis club, is it actually legal for people to gather and do this? 
>> It is legal. The voters of colorado have spoken and the voters of colorado legalized cannabis. And it is a new year in the mile high city. And it is a wonderful new year. And freedom was in the house last night. 
>> What is interesting also is does this club have any sort of legal responsibility to -- legal responsibility to its clients? If somebody comes there and then goes home and they're impaired, what responsibility does the club have? 
>> Well, the club has a similar responsibility to any bar that overserves a patron or puts somebody in a difficult spot. It is the same thing. The voters of colorado wanted to treat marijuana like alcohol. And that is what this club does to some extent. We provide marijuana but we don't sell it. And people can come and exercise their constitutional rights together and associate together. 

[00:17:44]


>> So this club, is it like any other kind of club? Can you get a drink or are you basically just smoking pot? And is there dancing? Are there couches? Walk me through it. 
>> Well, what we had last night was a deejay, we had some good music and we had some refreshments. We did break out the cheetos and goldfish. And those were gone by the end of the night. And the champagne was not all consumed. We had some of that to ring in the new year. We didn't sell liquor. We can't do that. It is a lot of conversation and the feeling last night is this is our new freedom. And we are emerging from the chains of prohibition in this state. And washington state is doing the same. And so there is a lot of pent-up emotion and demand to exercise our freedoms. And that's what happened last night. And it was a wonderful thing. You know, across the united states there were, I'm sure, lots of bars that were celebrating new year's eve and there was probably some violence and problems with those liquor establishments. Club 64 had no such problems. It was peaceful. It was positive. And it was a good thing. And everybody was happy. 
>> What is so interesting is that, you know, those of us of a certain generation knew a group of people called sort of pot heads, quote/unquote. Is this more of a refined crowd or are you concerned that there may still be a negative connotation about the clientele that is coming and doing this? Because not everybody is going to. 
>> Well, we have a very diverse membership. All ages, different races, social, economic levels, but these different people come together because of marijuana. And because of cannabis. And so it is actually a very diverse club. And is there a stigma with marijuana? Of course. There is a stigma with alcohol too. We are looking to move past that, though. We do it in a respectful and classy way. And we do it in private on our own. And we're not making a spectacle of ourselves by any means. 

[00:19:54]


>> Do you think people will be more out in terms of saying, i light up. Did you? 
>> I think people are pretty open about that. I think people at the club, they're proud to exercise their constitutional rights. They're proud of what the voters of colorado did. And the voters of colorado spoke very loudly. We enacted thiu overwhelmingly, 55% of the vote. It got more -- amendment 64 got more votes in colorado than president barack obama got in colorado. So marijuana is popular here. And we're not ashamed of it. And the members of this club are not ashamed to be exercising our constitutional rights. 
>> All right, very good. Robert cory jr., Thanks so much for joining us. 
>>> Well, any minute house republicans and democrats are expected to announce what each party will do iegards to the fiscal cliff deal. Dad. broke way to divvy up this shared data plan...Fairly.

>>> Well, just moments ago vice president joe biden met with house democrats rallying votes in favor of the fiscal cliff deal that passed the senate in the wee hours of the morning. Biden is playing a major role in the negotiations. Jessica yellin is at the white house. Jessica, what is the mood after the vice president's meeting there? 
>> Reporter: Hi, deb. First of all, the vice president's motorcade just got back here to the white house. So clearly work continues. There is a sense still that things are progressing and this is going to come to completion. It's not surprising to anybody that there are concerns by democrats and that some of them would voice them. The vice president's meeting lasted about 90 minutes. Obviously if everything was smooth sailing, it would have lasted much less time. So but they're used to that. Vice president biden has done these deals now three times. And he goes up there and is sometimes the punching bag and listens to what democrats have to complain about, takes it all on board, explains to them. One person in the room I think tweeted out and described it as a bit of a filibuster by the vice president. But he is done now and back and the white house is confident. I wouldn't say overly confident, but they feel good that they will get the democrats they need to support this, deb. 
>> And it is interesting because there were some senate democrats who did vote against it. Is there any particular part of the plan that he's really trying hard to push amongst the democrats? 
>> Reporter: Well, it depends. There is -- progressive democrats are upset about the fact that the income tax threshold, people who will be paying a higher income tax was set at $450,000, not $250,000. Their argument is -- democrats had republicans over the barrel. Why did they give in on this point? The other thing that is very ting to some democrats is why did they put off the debt fight until -- for another two months because there will now be a debt ceiling battle in two months and they're very upset that they will lose leverage and have to negotiate with republicans again. From the white house's point of view and other moderate democrats point of view, there is no choice, this is what one does in a negotiation. They have to compromise. 

[00:25:38]


>> And so when we look at all of this, and how this plays out, i think david brooks coined the term trench warfare when it comes now to the kinds of negotiations we're going to be seeing up there on capitol hill. 
>> Yes. 
>> Is that the sense you're getting it not going to get easier to do a deal after this? 
>> Reporter: Gosh, I feel like we have been in the trenches and now we're down to the muck. And we're barely seeing the light. We have been there for more than two years now. So, yes, I point out that one of the most important elements of this for the white house was obviously raising income tax rates for the highest income earners. The president campaigned on that. It was an absolute must. He got that. The other piece of this was something we kind of gloss over, it is that two-month buydown on those big spending cuts. And part of the way agreed to this, they postponed the debt cliff, if you will. And the way they agreed to it is they paid down $24 billion on the deficit. Remember, congress agreed to these major spending cuts, right? 
>> That's two months down the road, so even that is kind of a little bit anti-climactic. It is like, my god, the fiscal cliff, the fiscal cliff. We'll deal with it in two months. Jessica yellin, so much more to talk to you about. We'll check in later, but thanks so much.

>>> Wel, despite progress early this morning in the senate,nd you can see right there with the democrats are expected to speak, despite some progress, the fiscal cliff deal is far from over. At this hour, a vote is still not scheduled in the house. But multiple house members did take to the floor today to say that their vote is going to be no. Senior congressional correspondent dana bash is on capitol hill and, dana, you're with one of those folks who was in the democratic meeting with the vice president. Was it a pep rally? Was it a warning? Was it a rallying cry, your president needs you? What went on in there. 
>> Reporter: Sounds more like pep rally but I'll have the congressman speak for himself. This is steve israel, congressman from new york. And the chairman of the democratic congressional campaign committee. Why you've seen him a lot on cnn, in charge of electing democrats in the last cycle and this coming cycle aswell. Let's answer the question that deb just asked, which is, tell us what the vice president told you all. 
>> Well, he was evangelical, converting a bunch of skeptics. I think he's persuaded our caucus that there are pieces of this deal that everybody can dislike. But going off this cliff is something that no one can accept. And while everybody would prefer improvements, nobody can get the deal that he got. And that the president got. So we're at a moment of truth. We have to get this done. And he let the caucus feeling that we need to get this done. 
>> Reporter: Now, again, you're talking about the democratic vice president talking to a group of democrats, happened to be evangelical talking to a group of skeptics. 
>> There were a few members who have concerns about pieces of this. As the vice president said, there is something in there -- it is the perfect compromise, like any classic compromise. At the end of the day, nobody is entirely happy. But what would make america completely unhappy is if we just vote defense this thing and go off the cliff. We have done our part. There is a critical mass of democrats that are prepared to support this. And continue to negotiate, to strengthen the middle class and protect medicare. We now need the republican caucus, once again, this is like deja vu all over again, we now need the republican caucus to meet us and get this thing passed and move on. 

[00:31:45]


>> Reporter: One last question about the democratic meeting. Do you think keeping on the evangelical metaphor, do you think he converted enough of his fellow democrats that you feel -- how many at this point do you think as a member of the leadership, how many do you think you're going to lose? 
>> I'm not concerned about losing democrats. I'm concerned about what the republican majority is going to do. They're the majority. They have a responsibility for getting this done. This place has become like an episode of the road runner cartoon. Every congress is another cliff. They have a responsibility to produce the votes. They have yet another caucus. We should have done this a year ago, should have done it a month ago, could have done it two weeks ago. They need to come to the table and work with us. 
>> I came from downstairs where the house republicans are still meeting as we speak, I believe. And it sounds like still going on, behind closed doors, but it sounds like there are a lot of complaints that this deal is just dealing with taxes and they really want to include spending cuts. And perhaps they haven't decided what they're going to do, perhaps house republicans might agree to offer an amendment to this. That adds spending cuts. Do you think that's a deal killer? 
>> We have done spending cuts. We did a trillion dollars in spending cuts in the budget control act las. There are spending cuts. There are cuts in this. Sequestration is late for two months but paid for with a mix of revenues and additional spending cuts. There are spending cuts in this. At the end of the day, we need compromise. I learned one thing, in politics and in life, when it is always my way or the highway, you end up on the highway. Let's just stay here and get this done. We have to revisit many issues in the next two months and there will be other opportunities for us to negotiate, but right now, we cannot continue to hurdle off this cliff. More people want action. 
>> One last question, a good chance that the house, you will not be voting on this today. Is that problematic, especially as a new yorker, you know the markets are going to open again tomorrow. Is that a potential risk? 
>> The longer we wait, the less confidence the american people have and they have very low confidence in us already. Number one. Number two, the more that can be done, and right now we need more confidence and less mischief. Democrats want to get to yes. Republicans need to quit trying to get to no. 

[00:33:56]


>> Thank you very much, steve israel. Appreciate it. A readout from what the vice president told democrats and also pretty good sense of where democrats are as they're waiting for republicans who run the house to make a decision, deb, about where ey're going to go and that they're going to do and when this vote will happen. 
>> Everybody watching and waiting. Dana bash, thank you so much. 
>> Thank you. 
>>> There is a lot of attention on john boehner and whether he's got the votes to pass the fiscal cliff plan. There are some in his own party who may stand in his way. That's coming up next. Instead I got heartburn.

[00:37:10]


>>> As we continue to keep an eye on the fiscal cliff, the republicans continue to meet behind closed doors, a meeting described as a bit noisy and excited. The democrats just finished their meeting with vice president joe biden. That was described as an evangelical meeting. Still unclear whether a vote by the house will take place on the bill that was passed by the senate or whether in fact they will amend it and send it back to the senate. Joining us from washington, bob cusack, the managing editor of the online journal the hill. And, so, bob what is the latest word you have as to what is going on and whether in fact john boehner can get his people together to vote for this? 
>> Well, it is going to be very difficult. House republicans don't like the senate passed bill, even though it passed 89-8. It looks like the house will pass something to return it back to the senate. They'll amend it in some way, it looks like, because they don't like this $4 trillion price tag that just came out over the last ten minutes, cbo just released that. And this is just a tough vote for house conservatives who many of them would worry about a primary challenge should they vote for this. So it looks like the drama is intensifying here. This is not going to be over with a final house vote today. It will just be kind of the beginning. They're going to punt it back to the senate and they'll have to see -- they'll have to pass that version, whatever is in that, and then the senate will have to decide what to do. 
>> Bob, talk to us about the cost of this. You just cited the -- how much did you say, how many trillion? 4 trillion. 4 trillion. The bill, as it stands, if i understand you, will cost $4 trillion. 
>> Yes. And that's what conservative republicans are upset about. A month ago, we were talking about -- they proposed $2.2 trillion in spending reductions and now you have this. There say lot of provisions in this the estate tax, or income rates, also fix for doctors who participate in medicare. These are all very expensive items. The senate passed it. Earlier today. But the house doesn't like it. 

[00:39:14]


>> And what is so amazing is when I was reading through it, it is a very lengthy and wordy and thick document, how many other things sort of found its way in. You know, from the way we have been breaking it down, the fiscal cliff, how much do you tax, how much do you spend, but are a lot of other pieces and add-ones in a sense, am i wrong? 
>> A lot of people didn't like how the senate process worked. It was struck behind the -- the deal was struck behind closed doors. Then they went to the floor on new year's eve, and right after new year eve, they passed it. Basically nobody had time to read the bill. And it had a very limited amount of debate at 1:00, 2:00 in the morning. So that's what house republicans, they stressed they like to read bills, they don't like to vote in the middle of the night. And the more they look at this, the less they like it. The bottom line here, if speaker boehner does not support this bill, and he has not expressed public opposition or support for this, it is not going to pass the house. House democrats clearly are on board. The president is on board. But house republicans are not. And they control the chamber. 
>> Bob, it is hard to have sympathy for lawmakers who basically say we don't like the way this was done, we don't want to pass bills in the middle of the night. They had plenty of time where they could have had plenty of time to read through whatever it was they negotiated. So right now, the american public is really running out of patience. And goodwill. And so it almost seems that it is incumbent of the house republicans to at least maybe have a show of good faith, that they're willing to consider this as they negotiate everything else, do you think a lot of the amendments we're going to see are going to be about spending cuts? 
>> I think it will. There will be a lot of -- and house republicans have to band together because house democrats are not going to support those spending cuts and it is true. Congress had a long time to deal with this, even since the election they had two months, waited until the last second. Boehner couldn't pass the so-called plan b bill. He lost a lot of leverage on this. This is very tricky for john boehner and his lieutenant. They have a relatively narrow house majority, polls show that the fiscal cliff blame would be mostly on them, not the president. Not on democrats. That might change. But this is a very risky move if we go well into january with this unresolved. 

[00:41:28]


>> And you got to wonder if the house republicans are kicking themselves for not passing the plan b, which allowed for tax rates on people making a million or more since the figure that passed was significantly less at 400,000. Bob cusack, thank you. We appreciate you being with us. 
>> Thanks, deb. 
>>> Well, developing this hour in alaska, on a shallow and rocky shore line near the uninhabited kodiak island, a huge oil rig has run aground. It has run aground.

[00:45:41]


>>> New details on hillary clinton's health scare. The secretary of state is being treated with blood thinners to help dissolve a blood clot discovered in her head. The clot is located in the vein between the brain and the skull, and it is just behind her right ear. The doctors at new york presbyterian hospital say they're confident she will make a full recovery. Her daughter chelsea echoed that positive outlook in a tweet saying, quote, thank you to all for sending good thoughts my mom's way. Grateful to her doctors and that she will make a full recovery. Dr. Sanjay gupta has more on the possible dangers mrs. Clinton faces. Sanjay? 
>> We have new details about what happened to secretary of state hillary clinton. Specifically where this blood clot is located. You remember before we knew she had a blood clot, she was getting blood thinning medication and we can surmise from that the blood clot itself wasn't located on top of the brain because if it was, actually pushing on the brain, blood thinning medication would worsen that, make that pressure on the brain evenworse. Let me show you here by way of model. First of all, this is on the right side of her head, but for the demonstration I'll show you the left side of the head for the model. Here you have the brain, the blood clot was pushing on the brain, you wouldn't get blood thinning medication. But in this case, the blood clot is located in one of the blood vessels inside the brain. A blood vessel that typically drains blood away from the brain. It is called the sinus here. And in her case, it is in this area over he. The transverse sinus on the right side of her brain. This is a pretty rare condition, something that doesn't happen often. But needs to be treated with blood thinning medications to try and make that clot dissolve. Here is the concern. You have blood going to the brain, that blood also needs to leave the brain. If that blood is not leaving the brain, the pressure in the brain can start to build up. That's what you don't want to happen. Now, most likely, you know, in the secretary's case, they need to get another scan at some point to actually show that the clot, the blood clot inside the blood vessel has in fact gone away. Doctors very important to point out they said, look, she had no stroke from this, which is a potential complication. She had no neurological impact whatsoever. I've heard from sources that if you were to see her, you wouldn't know that this sort of problem was going on. But, again, a rare occurrence, a cerebral venous clot being treated with blood thinners in the hospital. As we get more information, we'll bring it to you. Back to you.

>>> The authorities are looking into threats against the u.S. Ambassador to yemen. There are reports that a terrorist group with links to al qaeda has issued a reward for his death. Brian todd has the details. 
>> Reporter: Less than four months after the killing of u.S. Ambassador chris stevens in benghazi, libya, word of a specific threat to another american envoy, in another arab country where al qaeda is dangerously strong. A bounty of $160,000 worth of gold has been placed on gerald feuerstein. According to site intelligence group which monitors jihadists on the internet, the bounty was announced in audio clips and screen grabs posted by militants. We can't verify the clip's authenticity, but the u.S. And yemeni governments are taking them seriously. The militants also offered $23,000 for the killing of an american soldier in yemen. Analysts say the militants may be affiliated with al qaeda in the arabian peninsula, the terror group's powerful branch in yemen. 

[00:53:22]


>> They have really been looking for a way to hit the united states, whether the u.S. Embassy in yemen, which they attacked in september of 2008, or carrying out more attacks here in the united states. 
>> Reporter: This is the same group that came close to detonating a bomb in the underwear of a militant in the 2009 christmas day plot to bomb an airliner bound for detroit. It attempted to send printer bombs to the u.S. The following year and tried again this year to bomb a plane bound for the u.S. It is also not the first time al qaeda or an affiliate has offered gold for the killing of a prominent american. 
>> The example that leaps to mind is paul bremmer who was the most important american nonmilitary official in iraq during the george w. Bush administration. And osama bin laden himself offered substantial reward for his death. 
>> Reporter: In one got to bremmer. The odds of an assassination this time, a yemeni official says security is being stepped up around the u.S. Embassy and the areas where diplomats live. Analysts say ambassador feuerstein may not need to reinforce his personal security detail too much. 
>> They had this little mini green zone in which all the people who work at the embassy essentially live within a very secure corridor there right next to the embassy and so they travel from this secure housing location to the embassy and back and forth. And they don't really get out, which makes them very, very difficult targets. 
>> Reporter: But one deadly asset that al qaeda in yemen has may tip the balance. That's this man, ibrahim al yasiri. Intelligence officials say he was behind that christmas day attack three years ago, and the printer bomb plot. He once placed a bomb inside the body of his own brother, which came close to killing a top saudi official. He is still at large, and experts say has been able to train others on his techniques.

>>> The man who lived a real life movie thriller by protecting american lives during the iran hostage crisis has died. John shearman helped shelter and smuggle six american diplomats out of iran in 1980. The rescue was the basis for the hit movie "ao" with ben affleck. While his role was left out of the film, his actions during the hostage crisis were pivotal in protecting the americans after the u.S. Embassy in tehran was stormed by militants. He hid the americans in his home until they could escape the country. His son told us he was a humble man and a real canadian hero. Sheardown suffered from alzheimer's and had cancer. He was 88 years old. 
>>> Top of the hour. Good afternoon, everyone. I'm deborah feyerick. And right now the house is in recess while the nation is in limbo. Technically we went over the fiscal cliff when the new year began. But for all practical measures, the senate pulled a power shoot that should soften the fall. Senators approved it 89-8. Now it is up to the house to stop the fiscal cliff. That's $600 billion of automatic tax hikes and spending cuts. At this hour, though, a vote by the house is not yet scheduled. A multiple representative took floor today to say their vote would be no. 
>> I wish I could say this was a proud moment, a moment in which we started the year off right, in which the first of january was the first of great many good things. It isn't. We're kicking the can down the road. And worse than that, when faced with a mountain of debt that we were heading for, like an airplane, did we climb over it? No. What we're going to do in the present plan is put nearly another trillion dollars worth of debt on the american people. 
>> Well, joining us now from capitol hill, representative peter welsh, democrat of vermont. We see some democrats moving to the podium. They are also scheduled to speak. Congressman welsh, we don't want to interrupt you. So nancy pelosi stepng to the podium. Let's take a quick listen. 

[01:00:32]


>> Well, we just finished a standing room only, three-hour long caucus meeting, which -- in which the vice president not only roused the entire membership, but also gave us a very thoughtful and detailed explanation of what has gone on, and how it was that he and the president, working with the democratic and republican leaders in both houses, were able to come together on this compromise. We first want to say thank you to the vice president for being so gracious. Quite honestly, so frank in his conversation with us in explaining as much as he could about what has transpired over the last several weeks. We nowre waiting to hear from our republican colleagues, whether or not they want to do what the senate did, in a very bipartisan fashion. And give the american people an opportunity to have a vote. There are people throughout this country who might look at this deal and love it, some might hate it, some may not understand it. But we firmly believe that every american in this country should have a right to have a vote in the people's house. The senate sent us a bill. We're hoping the house will respect the wishes of the american public and let the representatives of those people vote up or down on that legislation. And with that, let me turn now to our leader, nancy pelosi. 
>> Thank you very much, chairman. Last night the senate -- I guess it was early this morning, the united states senate voted in uncharacteristically very strong bipartisan way, 89 votes in favor of the compromise legislation. This is -- thatas historic. That legislation was sent over to the house. Up until now our speaker has said when the senate acts, we will have a vote in the house. That is what we said. That is what we expect. That is what the american people deserve. And so we look forward now as we go forward in this day to see what the timing will be for a straight up or down vote on what passed 89-8 last night in the united states senate. Today we had the privilege of, as our chairman has said, of hearing from the vice president. He talked about what is in the legislation and what lies ahead, and difficult negotiations as we go forward. We had a frank, as you said, mr. Chairman, frank discussion in that regard. Right now our members, after very thoughtful deliberations and review, are continuing to review the legislation, weighing the pros and cons and weighing the equities of not going over the cliff, but we all are very eager to see the form that the republican leadership will put on to the floor today. I think that we have made gigantic progress. I hope that we can have a bipartisan agreement as we go forward. But as I said, our members are making their decisions now and we look forward to hearing from what the republicans have to say. A person who will know best what our numbers are in this regard at some point during the day is the distinguished whip mr. Hoyer. I'm pleased to yield to him. 

[01:04:02]


>> Thank you very much, madam leader. 112th congress has about 46 hours left to go. This congress unfortunately has been most known for an unwillingness to compromise. An unwillingness to come together to act on behalf of the american people. TODAY IS JANUARY 1st. Taxes will be going up on everybody in america if we don't act. Those who are relying on unemployment insurance, millions of americans relying on unemployment insurance to make sure they can support themselves and their families, if we don't act, we'll be at risk. Vice president biden has worked very hard to come to a compromise. By definition, a compromise has elements in it that each party does not like. But by definition it has things in it that each party should like. The speaker said that if the senate passed a bill, he would put it on the floor for a vote. The leader pointed out we expect that to happen. We think that's the best interests of the american people. We hope that our colleagues on the other side of the aisle can reach compromise. Our members are reviewing the specifics of the compromise that has been reached to determine whether they can support that compromise. I am hopeful this congress will as one of its last acts not only on this compromise, but also very hopeful and would expect that we would provide the emergency assistance needed for the victims of sandy. One of the country's worst storms in history that damaged the northeast so badly. I'm hopeful we will be able to move on both of these issues. And that we will have members on both sides who perhaps will not agree but hopefully we will have members on both sides who will agree and we can act as the american people expect us to do so. 

[01:06:23]


>> Why don't we ask -- we'll hear from the incoming vice chairman as well. 
>> Thank you. Thank you. I'll be very brief. I think the difference between a divided government and dysfunctional government is the willingness to compromise. We saw that in the senate, as leader pelosi and our whip mr. Hoyer have said. That means looking at an agreement, and deciding whether on balance it helps not democrats or republicans, but whether it helps move the country forward. And we're hopeful that republicans on the house will do as democrats and republicans did on the senate and weigh all the equities here but decide at the end of the day that not everybody gets 100% of what they want, democracy means as I said a willingness to come together for the good of the country. And that's what compromise is all about, especially in an era of divided government. So our members are taking a look at the bill, and, you know, we just would ask our republican colleagues to bear in mind the good of the country as they also weigh all the equities here. And with that, I turn it over to the distinguished vice chairman of our caucus. 
>> Thank you, chris. I will just very briefly we all appreciate the vice president coming to the caucus today in a very straightforward, very thorough way, explaining the process of the negotiation and why we are where we're at today. I do think, though, the time for discussion and talk is coming to an end. And it is going to be time for us to vote soon. Or all this would have been for not. Our being here, new year's eve, new year's day, happy new year to everyone, would have opinion for not if we don't come to some point and have a vote. And that's what the american people deserve, that's what the american people expect as well out of this process. We can either move forward in a bipartisan way, hand and hand, to avert the fiscal cliff, or our republican colleagues could help lead us off the cliff. We hope that's not the case. 

[01:08:33]


>> Questions. 
>> If I can ask -- 
>> I think you were first. 
>> Let me just ask, what are your spies on the other side in a sense telling you how it is going over there? Because you have to count heads with them as well. 
>> I'm not stipulating to any characterization of any information that we receive from our friends in the press. I really have no idea. 
>> -- As well to try to approve this. What are you hearing from the other side? 
>> I think that what your question is better addressed to the republicans coming out of their conference. We just came out of ours. And we know what you tell us as to what is coming out of their conference. 
>> Let me just say, we haven't had an opportunity to talk to their leadership at this point in time -- 
>> since our meeting. 
>> You said a moment ago you would prefer a straight up or down vote on that. 
>> Absolutely. 
>> Is that because of the time or is that because this was a deal brokered by the vice president? 
>> No, it was a -- it was a bill that was passed in the united states senate 89-8, tell me when you've had that on a measure as controversial as this. 
>> -- They had problems with that one, almost to the number, similar. 
>> Right. Well, I hope we don't have a reenactment of that where the republicans in the house painted themselves in the extreme of not wanting to find compromise and a solution. But let's be optimistic. Let us all, as mr. Hoyer and others have said, hope they decide in favor of the country as we go forward, but the issue of whether we have an up or down vote shouldn't even be a question. It shouldn't be a question. We were told when this -- we would not have any legislation on the floor until and unless the senate acted and when they did, we would have a vote. And so we want to have that vote. And we look forward to what the timing is on that. And this is all about time. And it is about time that we brought this to the floor. Mr. Hoyer mentioned, it was only a matter of a couple of months since the election, eight weeks. And in that period of time, we have been pushed to even -- even into a new year. It is long overdue for us to have this solution to go forward, and remove all doubt as to how we go -- what comes next for our country. So we expect the american people deserve an up or down vote on what was passed in the senate. 

[01:11:09]


>> Madam speaker, if there is an up or down vote, how many democratic votes would you have? Will you be able to deliver? 
>> That is not a subject I'll be talking about right now. As we mentioned, all of us -- 
>> considering -- members are considering the legislation. Just heard from the vice president. And we will find out which members -- 
>> you're saying you want bipartisanship from the other side. Don't you have to say that you are willing to support this piece of legislation? 
>> I don't think there is any doubt we'll have bipartisanship. She asked me for the number. I don't have a number. But I can tell you, we will have a bipartisan vote. 
>> Thank you very much. 
>> When will you start whipping? 
>> Your premise is incorrect. 
>> That was the democrats wrapping up their version of what was going on in their meeting with vice president joe biden. Let's hear from the republican side of the aisle. The house gop just wrapped its closed door meeting. Senior congressional correspondent dana bash on capitol hill and, dana, you heard the minority leader nancy pelosi saying up or down, up or down vote. Does that mean that they would not consider any amendments by the republican? You're with the republican now. 
>> Reporter: Right, that's what she's pushing the republicans who control the house to do, to just have an up or down vote and have no amendments. I was talking to lots of republican members coming out of this meeting, just now, and it seems as though there is pretty intense sentiment to amend it, to put more spending cuts in there. And so that seems to be an issue and I'll bring in one of the republicans in that closed door meeting, congresswoman ann hayworth. If you can describe the feeling among your republican colleagues in this meeting just now. 
>> Well, you know, there is a whole range of sentiments there. Clearly we want to get the best net benefit for the american people that we can. This bill, as you delve into the details, cbo just scored it, is an enormous net spending increase. Even though there are some forms of tax relief that we did want to see, we passed a bill back in august to extend tax relief for everyone, grow the economy, best thing we can do, really. There was no -- there is no spending restraint. In fact, there is new spending. So that's a tremendous concern. Are we really going to benefit people? We know we need tax relief. We don't want everybody's taxes to go up. We want our hard working citizens to have that relief. But if we're massively increasing spending for every dollar of cuts, there is one estimate, $41 spent of new spending or spending for every dollar of cuts. We're not getting a good deal. 

[01:13:52]


>> Reporter: Would you vote for -- would you vote for the senate bill without any amendments? 
>> I would -- trusting in the deliberations of our conference, representing the american -- we were re-elected as a house majority in this election, as was the president, we know, so we have a job to do. And I am very hopeful that we will be able to come up with an alternative, an amendment that we can present to the senate, and that there will be a public voice here. This is a good time for the public to be engaged. The new year. We really need to have an honest discussion about spending. 
>> Reporter: You know, particularly as a member of the class of 2010 that ushered in this republican majority, there are a lot of people out there, many democrats, but some not, saying here they go again, the house republicans, messing everything up. 
>> Representing the american people. Trying to do the right thing. Because really we were elected and then re-elected as a majority to bring the federal government to the right size to respect every tax dollar, wherever those taxpayers come from, all of us pay taxes, everyone in this country, in one or another way. Those dollars have been massively misspentn the past administration for four years. We have more than a trillion dollar deficit. 
>> Reporter: Another concern i heard was the markets. The markets open tomorrow. And a lot of concern about what this will do to rattle the economy -- this meeting, not even taking a vote, no matter what happens. 
>> We need to weigh all the factors. I assure you we are. The discussion was vigorous. It was thoughtful. It represented an entire range of views about where we strike the balance between the perfect and the good, don't let the perfect be the enemy of the good, but we really do have a serious problem on our hands that the president and the senate have essentially refused to address. The senate hasn't passed a budget in three years, three and a half years now. And all of a sudden they come up with this last minute bill. They're the ones who have really been holding the american economy and the american taxpayer hostage for the past several years. Not right. 

[01:16:13]


>> Thank you very much for joining me. Appreciate it. Deb, just to be clear for our viewers to understand, if at the end of the day there is going to be another meeting later today at some point of house republicans, if the decision is to put up on the house floor an amendment with spending cuts, really any kind of amendment, what would then have to happen is it would have to go back to the senate for another vote. They would have to either cept if or change it again. And so what it means in real terms is this thing would not be over. And it could drag out, it could drag out until tomorrow or the next day anyway because we don't even know no matter what the votes are when they would occur. All of that is yet to be decided, very, very fluid as you just heard. 
>> Like one huge ping-pong match there. And we're just learning, dana, eric cantor is telling reporters that he does not support the bill. He does not support the bill. He didn't say whether he would vote against it. He said he did not support the bill. Joining us from capitol hill, representative peter welch, the democrat of vermont. Thank you so much for being here with us. One of the big questions, do you have any hesitations about voting for the bill that has passed the senate? 
>> I don't have hesitation about voting for it. There is a lot of things I don't like. And a lot of us thought that the president should have held firm on the revenues at $1.6 trillion, because that's got to be a significant component of a long term balanced deal. On the other hand, we weren't able to get it, partly because of the practical realities of legislating in this town. So what we have now is a middle class taxcut, they're going to stay at the lower rates. We have broken the iron grip of grover norquist on the republican party, at least in the senate, and taxes have gone up on the top 2% and that will help us if going forward. And then secondly, we have a compromise. And that is really vital to this country, to see that congress can have debates in division and can make decisions. And there is no harm that is being done by this bill to the american economy and the american middle class. There is some positive things here, despite the fact that both sides are going to have a lot to criticize, and the thing that is alarming to everybody is that two months from now, we're going to be back at it again with the debt ceiling, with the -- with the budget expiring, and that is going to be another fight all over again. 

[01:18:33]


>> You know, congressman, you say that there will be no harm to the american middle class. But the republicans would argue that by not putting in any spending cuts, that in fact you are harming the middle class, because it is just incurring more and more and more debt. The house minority leader nancy pelosi said up or down vote. Do you expect the republicans to come back with an amended version of this deal? 
>> Well, that's where the speaker has a real -- he's got a jam. Because the republicans do not want a vote for this. They note revenues have to go up, but they don't want their fingerprints on any tax increase. And the fact is if they amend it and put in all kinds of cuts that haven't been part of the negotiation, it may appease their base, but it won't solve our problem. So the speaker, I think, knows that on a practical level. But he's got a caucus that does not want to violate the grover norquist pledge. By the way, the debt is a serious problem. And that's why I think the president and many of us were disappointed once again that we didn't get a grand bargain. Everything should be on the table. But at least this time there is an outcome that is possible, that will do no harm, and will allow us to continue this debate on how to right size government and get savings in some of our benefit programs. 
>> All right, congressman peter welch, thank you. It appears at least the ball has been moved a little bit down the field. Thank you so much. We appreciate your time. 
>> Thank you. 
>>> Well, forget the politics for a second. Up next, find out what the breaking developments mean for the markets tomorrow. And your paycheck. That's right. Your paycheck in the coming months. More breaking news continues. Stay here. Humans. EVEN WHEN WE CROSS OUR t's AND DOT OUR I's, We still run into problems. Namely, other humans. Which is why at liberty mutual insurance, auto policies come with new car replacement and accident forgiveness if you qualify. See what else comes standard at libertymutual.Com. Liberty mutual insurance. Responsibility. What's your policy? $100,000. We asked total strangers to watch it for us. Thank you so much. I appreciate it. I'll be right back. They didn't take a dime. How mu in fees does your bank take to watch your money? If your bank takes more money than a stranger, you need an ally. Ally bank. Your money needs an ally. 

[01:22:40]


>>> Well, whatever goes down on capitol hill today, your taxes are going to go up a little bit. First, everyone is getting hit with the social security payroll tax. It is going back up from 4.2% to 6.2%. So therefore person making an annual salary of about $50,000, nail see about a thousand dollars less this year. There is also a new medicare tax, close to 1% of income for people making over 250 grand. That group will also pay nearly 4% more on dividends and capital gains on investments. And if you do put money away in a flex spending account for things like medical expenses, you won't be able to stash as much as you did last year because there will be fewer deductions. I'm going to go now to terry savage, personal financial columnist for "the chicago sun times." First, the congressional budget office first came out with some figures about how much the senate plan will cost. And the report is it could be as much as $4 trillion. Doesn't seem like that's the spending the republicans want. 
>> That's over thenext ten years. We have to start out. This is very allison in wonderland. Like the mad hatter's tea party. When they all finish congratulating themselves on getting a deal done, which they probably will, they'll find out they haven't done much about anything. They have made tax changes and many people will pay more taxes as you described. But they haven't done a thing about spending. The cbo assumed from its baseline here that all those bush era tax cuts would go away. So when the tax cuts only went away for certain people, it really does add $4 trillion and it reveals the fallacy of this whole deal, which is that we haven't made any, any, any serious attempt to deal with spending over the next ten years. And, of course, that will come up as we bump up against the debt ceiling in a month or two. 
>> And what is interesting is the democrats would argue, look, we're going to be bringing in about $600 billion over ten years, but that's really only a sliver of the population that is going to be sort of funding that amount of money. 

[01:24:47]


>> You have to remember that every year for the last three years, we have had -- added to e budget deficit. We had a budget deficit of $1 trillion every year for the past three years. So that our national debt is now up over $16 trillion. Here is another $4 trillion we can project if we go forward without making any effort to deal with the outlying years in terms of all of the things that the government promised to pay. And that's why this -- this deal, everybody is excited about just this tax fixation, and that's important to people. But the -- actually the people that will get hit hardest on the tax deal are the lower income people, because that social security payroll tax really impacts everybody the first $110,000 that you earn will now be taxed up to an additional 2.42%. So 6.2% is the take-out of your base pay, and everybody will see less in their paychecks starting with the next paycheck. 
>> So interesting. When you look at this, do you think that with everything that has gone on, the issues of spending will be able to be dealt with, practically, and calmly later on or do you think right now people are just going to dig in, it is going to affect the stock market, going to affect how we pay taxes, how we spend, do you think there is some area of discussion, some common ground? 
>> If you sit around watching cnn all the time, as I do, it has got to make you feel a little helpless. The rest of the world is watching. When they come up with a deal, I'm going to assume the house will make this deal and not try to send an amendment back to the senate, the markets are anticipating a deal yesterday that -- the market closed up 150 points, so we will probably see a carry through of the rally. We won't see the u.S. Markets, the futures open at 6:00 a.M. Eastern tomorrow. We'll see the asian markets, they have been closed for holiday, they'll open in a few hours. Then europe. I assume there is a deal. You'll probably see some kind of relief rally, the thing we see when greece takes a step or italy takes one of those crazy votes, to make it look like they're dealing with their debt. But over the long run, the whole world has to be watching the fact that america has not seriously attacked the issue of our overspending that has gone on year after year. And that will come to a head and I sure hope they'll deal with it better. It will be a new congress that has to deal wit in february. 

[01:27:16]


>> Exactly. David brooks said they really didn't deal with any really, really tough choices. That will be coming up in the weeks ahead. Terry savage, thanks so much. We want to read you a comment from house speaker john boehner, from his spokesperson, just coming out now. It says, quote, the speaker and leader laid out options to the members, and listened to feedback. The lack of spending cuts in the senate bill was a universal concern among members in today's meeting. Conversations with members will continue throughout the afternoon on the path forward. Wolf blitzer is going to be joining us. He's going to be breaking it all down for us. STAY WITH US.s the Galaxy Note II. You can do two things at the same time. You can watch videos and text.

[01:30:19]


>>> and the back and forth of the fiscal cliff continues, house speaker john boehner saying the lack of spending cuts is a universal concern for republicans. Dana bash joining us from capitol hill and she's got some reaction. Dana? 
>> That's right. I have with me republican CONGRESSMAN steve LaTourette. Thank you for joining us. 
>> Pleasure. 
>> You are one of the many people who I understand spoke out pretty vocally inside this closed door meeting. What did you say? 
>> I indicated this is a sad state of affairs that we'll take a bill that was passed on new year's eve by some sleep deprived octogenarians that is heavy on taxes and does nothing to cut spending, part of the big problem we have in the country. 
>> Sleep deprived octogenarians you call them. Let's be clear. This was a huge overwhelming vote in the senate. Not just on the democratic side, but republican side, 45 republicans, 40 voted yes. Your fellow republicans. 
>> I think a lot of that must have had to do with new year's eve and perhaps early celebration. It just doesn't make sense. This is not a good deal. It gives all the tax increases, which I said months ago, I would be on board to support, but we have to do something to cut spending. This bill increases spending by over $600 billion. 
>> Now, knowing what you do, based on this meeting, just now, do you think the likelihood is that your leadership is going to offer some kind of amendment dealing with spending cuts? 
>> Yeah, leadership meeting now and the anticipation is we'll get together about 5:00 and go over whatever it is that they have come up with and then ask for support. I'll be supportive. 
>> No matter what happens. 
>> I'll be supportive. And we can't let taxes go up on so many americans in this horrible economy. But the fact of the matter is we make their problem worse unless we figure out how to cut spending. He's asked tat we be responsible and whatever the spending cuts are, that they either be something the president himself proposed in the past, or that the senate has embraced in the past. I think that's what you'll see. 

[01:32:32]


>> What I have heard is that what they're talking about, or what you are talking about, is a pretty small scope of spending cuts, perhaps even just to replace, not to get into the weeds, but that's where we are now, just to replace the spending cuts that you have now to replace the sequester for two months with -- excuse me, the revenue rates with spending cuts. Meaning let me -- just to be fair to our viewers, what they passed there was to delay the sequester for two months and to pay for it with half tax revenue and half spending cuts. You want to get rid of the revenue part. 
>> And also the pay-fors are gimmicks, not spending cuts. If you do away with the sequester which everybody has to remember the price for the debt ceiling a year ago august, to now say we're just going to pretend that doesn't exist and kick it down the road is not responsible. And so it needs to at least be paid for. And I would advocate the two months is ridiculous. I don't know a defense contractor, a business person in the country, that does -- plans their business space upon two months of work. It should be replaced for a year. 
>> You were incredibly vocal and critical of your fellow republicans after they decided not to go along with your friend, the speaker, john boehner, on what he called plan b, raising taxes for millionaires and above. You said this is why people, you know, are questioning republicans and questioning your party. If there is something done to scuttle this, will that just speak to the concerns that you -- even you have as a retired men about your party? 
>> We need to be positive and we need to be for something. And I'm perfectly comfortable as a departing republican being for. The president won. Let's give him his tax increases he wants. I'm also comfort for reducing spending in a responsible way. I think most republicans come out of that thing, if that's the pitch that the speaker makes, being supportive of this plan. 
>> One last question. Do you think there will be a vote of any kind today? 
>> Yeah, I would think that we'll meet at 5:00 and as long as there isn't some big rebellion in the room, that something would come to the floor. They'll whip it during the votes. 

[01:34:38]


>> There was a rebellion in this meeting, right? You said earlier in the hallway that was refreshing? 
>> Yeah, the leadership listened to everybody for an hour and a half and actually listened to them rather than telling people what they wanted to do. Variety of opinions and I'm really hopeful they'll come up with something. 
>> Thank you for joining us. You helped us give us insight to what is going on in your republican caucus. Deb, back to you. 
>> All right, dana bash, thanks so much. There you heard it. Perhaps a vote will in fact take place today. We'll go to wolf blitzer now in washington. And, you know, wolf it fascinating, the republicans sound a bit exhausted, a bit defeated. Eric cantor saying he does not support the bill. And john boehner saying that lack of spending cuts is a universal concern, wolf. 
>> If there is a vote t looks like there will be a vote, probably a vote with some amendments to what the senate passed last night, assuming the republicans have their way and can get that passed. Not a bipartisan basis, a partisan basis. They are the majority of the house. Then they will send that legislation with an amendment back to the senate. Up to the senate to move either later tonight or tomorrow, to either accept it, make their own amendments, send it back to the house. The clock is ticking, though, because this 112th congress ends at noon on thursday. If they don't have it on the president's desk, whatever legislation the house and the senate can agree on by noon on thursday, then they start all over again because they swear in the 113th congress, new senate, new house they start from scratch, none of the legislation that passed the last night in the senate or might pass the house today is going to mean much because they have a whole new cast of characters, a lot of new members, new senators, new members of the house coming in. They start from scratch. They really don't have a lot of time and, remember, deb, if they don't get this done today, or at least by tomorrow, the markets are going to react and there is probably going to be a significant drop in the markets because people are nervous out there about what is going to happen. If they also don't pass anything, those draconian tax increases on everyone, not just people making more than $400,000 a year or $450,000 a year, taxes, tax rates are going to go up on almost all federal income taxpayers, and the spending cuts, the cuts in the sequestration isn't called, the domestic spending, the national security spending, they will go into effect as well. Going to be a lot of jobs that will be lost and a significant impact on the overall economy. So the stakes over the next 24 hours are significant. 

[01:37:14]


>> Wolf, clearly nobody has the energy to start from scratch. But do you get the sense from any of the republicans you're speaking to that at least they see this as moving the ball a little bit farther down the field? Certainly, you know, they haven't gone ten yards, but do they feel that way a little bit? 
>> They don't like the fact that there aren't a lot of spending cuts in this legislation. The tax provision the republicans aren't thrilled about, most of them, because it does raise taxes by -- for people making more than $400,000 or $450,000 a year. They're not happy with that. A lot of those republicans certainly in the house would go along with it as the democrats are going to go along with it if there were more spending cuts. We'll see. I suspect that we'll see an amendment once it comes up in the house for some significant spending cuts and we'll see where it goes as far as the senate is concerned. That could be the kiss of death, this whole thing could collapse over the next 24, 48 hours. And then they start from scratch on thursday. 
>> Absolutely. An amendment would have to go and an amended deal back to the house, the senate. Wolf blitzer, thanks so much. A lot more coming up at the top of the hour with you, thanks so much. Again? It's embarrassing It's embarrassing! We can see you Carl. We can totally see you. Come on you're better than this...all that prowling around. Yeah, you're the king of the jungle. Have you thought about going vegan Carl? Hahaha!! You know folks who save hundreds of dollars by switching to GEICO sure are happy. How happy are they Jimmy? Happier than antelope with night-vision goggles. Nice! Get happy. Get GEICO. Fifteen minutes could save you fifteen percent or more. 

[01:40:31]


>>> As we continue to follow all the ups and downs of the fiscal cliff, want to bring you up to speed, apparently eric cantor says he does not support the deal that is on the table. House speaker john boehner says the lack of universal spending cuts is a grave concern to the members. Whether they will amend the current deal and send it back to the senate, still watching. However, a prominent republican does say perhaps a vote could take place today. Still a little light at the end of the tunnel. It was an act 40 years in the making. The group known as the wilmington ten is finally seeing redemption. In 1972, nine black men and one white woman was convicted of firebombing a grocery store in north carolina. Despite their claims of innocence, and suspicions about racially biased prosecutors, all ten were found guilty. Victor blackwell is joining me now. Vict, take us back. What was the case all about? 1971, schools were desegregated in wilmington, north carolina. And the black high school was shut down. There were boycotts, there were protests, and ben chavis, later to become the executive director of the naacp was sent in to quell some of the violence. One night of rioting, the white home supermarket was fire bombed. These ten people, chavis, eight other black men and one white woman, the wilmington ten, they were framed. They were charged and convicted and sentenced to 282 years combined for this crime. Now, a few years later one witness in this case recanted his testimony, said he was coerced, bribed, and then the convictions were overturned but already served eight years in prison. Let me take you to just yesterday when north carolina governor bev perdue, pardoned them and gave them a pardon of innocence. Here is part of her statement. These convicts were tainted by naked racism and represent an ugly stain on north carolina's criminal justice system that cannot be allowed to stand any longer. That came yesterday. But four of the wilmington ten have already passed away. They didn't live to get that pardon of innocence. 

[01:42:38]


>> They didn't know that they had been pardoned, clearly. They died continuing to think -- has the prosecutor in this case responded to the accusations of racism? 
>> Yes, he has responded to them. I'll tell you how the accusations of racism came about. Just a couple of years ago, note pads, the legal pads that attorneys write on during the trial, they were handed over to an historian from the north carolina chapter of the naacp. They found notes next to jurors numbers that said kkk good. Uncle tom type or no. She associates with negros. Those types of comments and he has said to the wilmington star news, this happened back in october, that these are being misinterpreted, he was not making any racial comments and that he wanted blacks on the jury who would be fair. He could have an all white jury, but why would he want one? That is the concern. These were people, again, who were wrongly convicted, 40 years ago, and their family members actually say that the last 40 years have been a nightmare. We have some sound from them. 
>> It has not been easy when the fellows will go look for jobs, they were turned down. People just talked about them. Even o own family. The whole community did not stand together. 
>> They're convinced in their own minds and heart somebody did it, you know? So, I mean, we were chosen victims of crimes that we didn't commit. 
>> Governor perdue's historic action today doesn't remove the past 40 years of injustice against ten innocent american citizens. 
>> And, deb, the next question is, will they sue the state of north carolina for compensation for serving eight years in prison when this did not happen and they were convicted wrongly. 

[01:44:42]


>> Any answer to that question? 
>> Not yet. 
>> Victor blackwell, thank you so much. A fascinating story and they finally got their pardon. Thanks, appreciate it. Lots more coming up, everyone. STAY WITH US. @ l???? ??xw x???? ??xxxxxx ??' 6 '6??' ' z p@@@@@@p@@@@@@p@ @ ??6@ ?? 

[01:47:19]


>>> the stroke of midnight we not only welcomed in 2013, we also ushered in some new state laws. Thousands of them. Some of them are serious, some a little more bizarre, some make you wonder what took legislators so long. How about this? Illinois banning sex offenders from handing out halloween candy or dressing up like santa or the easter bunny. In florida, flashing your headlights to let oncoming cars know that police have set up a speed trap, that is no longer illegal. So flash away. California's banning stores from selling expired infant food and formula. Probably a good idea. And in maryland, same sex couples can now marry. Anne bremner joins me from seattle to talk about some of these. Here is the big one, anne. Folks in illinois and california are now a little less worried about what they have hidden in their facebook and twitter accounts. Explain this. 
>> Well, a new law, new year, new laws, and this is an interesting one because what it is is it basically says employers can't force you to give over your password for twitter, facebook, any kind of social media. And higher education authorities can't do it either. And it is basically, we say, twitter, facebook, these things are all public. But the right to privacy is one of the most important right we have in this country. Common law right, constitutional right. And this, I think you draw the line, the lawmakers have said in illinois and california, enough's enough. You have a reasonable expectation of privacy. Why did they need that information? They can't force you to give the passwords and I think that's a law that will spread beyond those two states. 
>> It certainly doesn't mean employers can't look at what you've got on your facebook page they can't access it. New laws in response to the jerry sandusky molestation case at penn state. How does that affect folks in oregon? 
>> This is a weird one too. So many people I think during the sandusky case, myself included, thought why aren't they having reporting laws in upper levels of education, in colleges. Saying if there is child abuse, you have to report. Clergy have to report. Teachers have to report. To this day, at least today, heretofore, we didn't have reporting requirements for college personnel. Basically says, it is a no-brainer, you should report, it is common sense. But now thou shalt report and if you don't, you have penalties if you're a college level personnel or authority, abuse, sports or otherwise, the sandusky case, the effects of that have spread all over including to the west coast.

House republicans, however, saying that there is still universal concern over what they see as a fundamentalack of spending cuts. Still, they seem resigned about a possible vote perhaps tonight. 
>>> Well, espn anchor hanna storm is back on the air after recovering from a serious accident involving a propane grill explosion. According to abc, the sports center host was using her gas grill three weeks ago when it he can ploeded causing second and third-degreeburns. Nischelle turner has more. 
>> It was really good to see her back on tv this morning. She was on to co-host the rose parade. She said before the show that she was going to be nervous. You could see that she was a little bit but her co-host, josh eliot, just said it was glad to have her back and that she looked as good as ever. Hanna mentioned that people may notice some differences to her appearance, like different hair texture because she was wearing extensions due to losing most of her hair and she lost her eyelashes and eyebrows. The accident happened on december 11th when she was using a gas grill outside of her home in connecticut. The grill exploded and hanna says she saw this wall of fire coming towards her. Her clothes caught on fire, her hair caught on fire. And during the broadcast she did mention and said thank you to the burn center f taking such good care can of her. Seeing her on the air, it is hard to believe that she had such a serious accident a few weeks ago because all you really saw was the bandage on her left hand. Most of the burns, we're told, are on her chest area because her clothes caught can on fire. She did have that covered up. But yes indeed, it was good to see her on the air because no one knew how extensive the injuries were because she hadn't been out. No one had seen her since the accident. 

[01:54:53]


>> And her husband, who is also a sports reporter, and we understand the bandage may have come because she ripped the shirt off that is was on fire.

>> And she did great this morning, too. She did a great job. 
>> She did.

Some of the students I had problems with here who would hang out withhe wrong crowd be associated with the wrong individuals they decided to take the money road or take the dope stroll. Most young people who do not have a role model as you were talking about earlier look at what they consider role models at school. THE GUYS WITH THE ROPE CHAINS, WITH THE B.M.W.s All the little money they have in their pocket it don't work, okay? It does not work. I've arrested at least three students former students here from boyd anderson. This is one of my students from high school. He's now turned to drugs. Selling, yes. This one, right here.

They do not have longevity because somebody's always out there looking to take what they have. Kids nowadays don't care. That's the problem. They don't care. Now you got 16-year-old kids, 13-year-old kids dealing drugs shooting the first person they see just for looking at them. Just for giggles. Another thing-- be careful where you go. Please be careful where you go. Like I said, you got little kids out there now who are jacking people. You got an i.D. On you, randy? 
Randy: No, sir. Oh, randy, randy, what are you doing here? Don't you know you're in a bad area? They eat people up like you for lunch around here, man.

Officer Linda Canada: Being with another cop and understanding what it's like to be with another cop has a lot to do with our relationship. He's a good father to my children. I couldn't ask for anybody to be more understanding. So, yes, I think I'll get married but not this year. 
( buzzer ) You always get a kiss at half time. Make sure that door's not locked. Put tape around the damn thing. They usually have a key too. I'll have another key. Maybe I can have rickie or debbie go up to the clerk when we get there and see if we can get more keys. I need you to do me a favor. I left my gun on the refrigerator. I got someone coming over to pick it up. Would you find my fur coat? It's in the children's closet. It's a rabbit fur coat. And give that to him too? Thank you. Come in to room four. That's the command post. Everybody come in there as easily as you can. Then we can determine exactly where every car is gonna be. Are we going to..? You just need to be covered. We took more down in the parking lots because the guys would make the deal but they didn't want to go to the room but once they make the deal, they go. Is there a signa one of the signals is I'll have this in my hair and when I want you to take him down I'm going to take out the comb. 
Officer: We had more last time which worked out better. Sleazy enough? Looks sleazy. When the guys come in, I don't want them to hear the echo. You'll record this? 
Canada: Sheriff's office does these stings to alleviate some of the street crime that the prostitutes are involved in. We also get complaints from local merchants who don't want the proitutes standing in front of their business. They feel it's bad for their business. When I'm out there I remember what my girls do-- the prostitutes that I arrest-- I try to think about how they walk how they turn their body how they face the traffic when the traffic is coming and when I get out there, I try to walk and move and turn and talk the way I hear them talk. How much for the two of yous? Depends on what you want, pal. All of it. You couldn't handle it. I'd die trying. 

[00:10:38]


Canada: You guys ain't cops, are you? No. How much? For what? For you. 20 bucks. Just me and you? Yeah. Me and you, 20 bucks. Where? I got a motel room right here. Number seven. You got a light? I got a lighter. That's good. If you got 30 seconds. Sure. I got all the time in the world. What are you all up to? Working. What's it look like? I thought maybe there was a bus stop here. Yeah, that's it. We're waiting for a bus.20 bucks. 
Man: For how long? 
Canada: How long will it take you? 
Man: It ain't going to take me long. Oh, a quickie. 20? Yeah. I got number seven in the back. You want to park here? I ain't going in. You want to do it right out here? In the parking lot? All right. Open your door. Okay. Freeze! Okay, boys, we got him. That was fun. I feel like saying, "no, listen "this is really just all a game. "This is for pretend. We're not really doing this." Mine? Go ahead. You take him. Go ahead. Do him. I don't want him. He's waiting for you to go after him. 
Canada: So, you ever done this before? Some of the guys that pulled up-- I look at them and I wonder why they would ever have to pick up a prostitute. Some of them were really good-looking and we find out later that they have good jobs. I don't think about it. I don't think about them... Sometimes, when they pull up, I don't even look at them. Well? No, it's not. Are you a cop? No. I haven't seen you nd before. Mm-hmm. I try not to think aboutwhat's going to happen to them. If this is going to ruin their life or ruin their marriage, because I'm here doing a job. I'm just doing my job. Sheriff's office! Freeze! Most every prospective customer is taken to the broward county jail where he's booked and processed. Some are issued notices to appear and some are held until they can bond out. Are you going to go sign the p.C.? Just see what ki of car she's talking to. So we know what to look for if we have to go out. You want one of us or both of us? Just you. Just me?25.00. Yeah.

>>> It is 4:25 from the new years eve ball drop to times square to fire works right here in philadelphia people did their best to ring in 2013 but party does not stop there, the mummers are getting ready to strut down broad street and we have the details for you this morning. 
>>> Plus just hours before the midnight deadline president obama and congressional members, avert the fiscal cliff what this means for you and yourcheck, we will have that as well. Let look outside our olde city studios. Turf say. I have been here in the last seven years or so this is probably one of the bus just new years day mornings I have ever seen. I say that but you cannot tell from this shot but there are cabs, people walking up and down the street. People were out having a good time last night. New year starting off on a cold note, sue serio will have your full forecast coming up in a bit. 
>>> Good day, everybody on this tuesday, january the first, 2013, I have to get used to saying that I'm sheneille jones in for karen hepp this morning. We will start with the senate passing fiscal cliff agreement and now up to the house of representatives. That vote is expect to happen sometime today. Senate's 89 to eight vote in favor of the agreement came down during the the overnight hours. It followed a flurry ovulate night meetings and debates on capitol hill, it should get plenty of calls at home telling them to work it out. Just hours before the vote began vice-president joe biden emerge from the senate caucus meeting saying he felt confident that the progress was finally being made. I feel good. I think we will get a very good vote tonight. 
>> The deal approved by senate will prevent middle class taxes from rising and raise rates on couples making more than $450,000 a year. That is higher then the president wanted. It will prevent a cut in fees for doctors who treat medicare patients. The agreement needs the approval of the house of representatives, by and large, it seems like sources say they are confident something will be done. They have passed the fiscal cliff and up to the house of representatives. Lets go to steve keeley. Sometimes people hear fiscal cliff and they glazed over and they didn't understand. You can put tonight perspective for everybody. 

[00:27:20]


>> Reporter: These people just want to come back from the holiday and figure it will get done because it needs to get down this house of representatis is often like a house of cards. We cannot stress enough it is not a done deal just yet and it could vote on it today in the house or house may change it and send it back to the senate which will have to vote on it again. Who knows. The house could always, because it is controlled by a republican majority unlike the senate controlled majority could vote against it and cause this whole flurry of new year war toy start all over again. 
>> I have said all along our most important priority was to protect middle class priorities. This legislation does that. Middle class families will wake up to take, and to the assurance that their taxes won't go up, $2,200 each. They will have the certainty to plan how they will pay for groceries, rent, car payment, all during next year. 
>> I feel very, very good about how this vote will go but having been in the senate as long as I have, two things you shouldn't do, you shouldn't predict how the senate will vote before you vote, youn't make a lot of money and surely you shouldn't predict how the house will vote. I feel, very, very good. I think we will get a very good vote tonight, but happy new year and I will see you all maybe tomorrow. 
>> Reporter: Who were the eight votes begins it? One of them another guy from delaware, it wasn't just hard line conservative whose didn't like this deal but moderate democrats including tom carper from delaware who s that no, but not enough no votes so it did pass the senate, in the middle of the night. While everybody was sleeping trying to have one of those cabs sheneille and ringing in the new year. It is not over yet. New years day it will not be just full of football but full of worry again and watching, washington to see what gets done in the house of representatives but don't expect this to pass the house realliesly. Remember, house led by john boehner could not even pass his even plan b that he was controlling the majority until he realized he didn't have enough votes. I wouldn't put any money thon 50/50 eitherway, sheneille, it is a house of cards in that congress. We saw them, stock market, plumet a couple years ago. It is anybody's guess what happened there. I wouldn't have confidence that some sources have because being around in this business, and watching washington for so long we know how craze that i place can be.

=======================================================

I want to see with my own two eyes. Right. So we followed him and this woman to the hotel. And I'm like, oh, my God. I am not believing this. If Ms. Hobbs seen me at a motel, she would've been in jail, I would've probably been in the hospital. She would've come in. She would've not sat idly and watch me in a motel with somebody. Not this lady. Announcer: She's the judge who gives rules on the law and life. She's intense with common sense. She's Judge Lynn Toler. OnDivorce Court, where real couples deal with real life. Rosa knew Larry was the man of her dreams the second she heard him sing in church more than ten years ago. But once married, Rosa's dream turned into a nightmare, as she soon discovered Larry was unfaithful. I'm tired of being cheated on, I'm tired of being lied to, and I'm tired of lying in the bed wcorpse. I'm tired of my wife verbally abusing me and taking advantage of my kindness. Announcer: Rosa says she's ready to her dream marriage to bed. Today on: Bailiff: All rise! Court is now in session. The Honorable Judge Lynn Toler presiding. You may be seated. Good day, ladies and gentlemen. I'm here today with Rosa Hobbs and Larry Lewis. Ms. Hobbs and Mr. Lewis, you have been together for four years. Uh, you have grown children from previous relationships. Mrs. Hobbs, you have brought Mr. Lewis here seeking $3,000 in transitional support, and you will explain that to me momentarily. But before we do, I'm gonna ask you to tell me a little bit about your marriage and why we're here in divorce court today. Well, when we first got together, I really, really... I mean, I felt this was the man for me, because I met him in church. Uh-huh. I just knew we were gonna be together. 

[00:02:00]


Mm-hmm. Forever and a day. Because, I mean, he made a speech in church. He spoke up in church, and... and he's a singer, too. And I love a man that sing to me. It just turns me on. Oh, my God. But, baby, he did a transforming act on me. Baby, he transformed. What did he transform into? A beast. A beast. I call him Incredible Hulk, baby. I don't know what to call him. Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, that's what I say. Well, give me, give me a little of Mr. Hyde. We heard Dr. Jekyll. 'Cause he starts, um, cheating around on me. Y-Your Honor, may I say... I'm gonna, I'm gonna let you-- get back to you. All right, thank you. Tell me when's the first time or the most elaborate time that he cheated on you. Girl, when this woman call my house... But now, now, now, I like you, Mrs. Hobbs, I do, but "girl," not appropriate. Oh! Excuse me! Forgive me. "Judge," "Your Honor..." Baby, I felt like I was talking to my friends just then. There you go. Anyway, forgive me. Thank you so much. But anyway, just like I said, he was a cheater because a woman called my house. I said, "Baby, you can have him. "You are more than welcome to have him, "because you're getting the leftovers anyways. "And make it so good where he don't come back messing with me. "You can be the bobblehead, the best bobblehead..." You told her to make it so good that he's not gonna want to come back to your house? Yes, baby, 'cause then I told him when he come back, she gonna have to see me. (applause) Now, Mr. Lewis, e about this lady. Okay, about this woman that she's talking about, she's absolutely right. I'm not denying that. But did she say, also, that me and her wasn't together at this time? The woman did not call her phone, the woman called my phone, Your phone. which she took and, you know, and made it her conversation. I got you. Okay, and back far as, um... The devil is a liar. Ms. Hobbs. Yes, ma'am. It always about, far as I'm cheating, we wasn't even together. We was together, but then we separated, we broke up. We wasn't married then. Okay, but then... Oh, so you were dating, you broke up 

[00:04:00]


Yes, ma'am. and she took your phone and answered with another-- Ms. Hobbs, is that what happened? No, ma'am. No, ma'am. She don't only, um... Your Honor, Ms. Hobbs is always accusing me of cheating... Right. ...but this is something that happened when we was married. There's this guy that, um, they got history. Mm-hmm. And, as a matter of fact, one day she came home, one morning-- I don't know if she knew I was there or not-- but I seen her when she got out the car, reached in the car and she kissed the guy. This guy with the history. And you two were married at the time? Yes, ma'am. And so what happened was, when she came in, I asked her about it. She told me-- I said, "Well, Rose, you know, what's this?" She told me that, "You know, I was reaching in the back to get something." Mm-hmm. And so I asked her again about this, and she finally came and said that, um, "Oh, yeah, he kissed me." Yo, but I'm the one cheating. Well, the reason I did... Now, Ms.-- tell me why you did. Because he's a friend of mines and he's always been there for me. And when he was acting like a jack, that man was there for me. He went and sold our-- he went and did everything but what he needed to do. He did what? I caught him-- I followed him and this woman at a motel. My sister and I was riding about, and I spotted him. And I spotted him, and I said, "Sis, let's go follow him. Let's follow him, let's follow him." I want to see with my own two eyes. Right. So we follow him and this woman to the hotel. I'm like, oh, my God. I am not believing this. This is not happening. And I'm looking with my own two eyes. But I sat there, and I said, "The devil is a liar." I'm not gonna let this man make my life miserable. Your Honor, let me say this. If you know Ms. Hobbs, if Ms. Hobbs seen me at a motel, she would've been in jail, I would've probably been in the hospital. She would've come in. She would'veat idly 

[00:06:00]


and watch me in a motel with somebody. Not this lady. Yes, I would've. It might have been another lady, but not Ms. Hobbs. Yes, I would have, because he ain't doing nothing with me. Your Honor, Your Honor... Maybe he can get it on with somebody else, but he wasn't doing it at home. Hang on, I'm gonna get back to you, Mr. Lewis. When you say he's not doing anything with you, what do you mean? Just like I say. He was a corpse in the bed. I mean, nothing. No touching, no rubbing, no feeling, no nothing. And I'm tired of that. Your Honor, I had a hip replacement. Right. And, um, I supposed to stayed in the hospital four days, but I ended up staying 35 days. Uh-huh. Um, what had happened was my hip deteriorated so bad until it broke my pelvis bone. And so I have bad nerve damage. Right. I have the drop foot. And, um, she came to see me, she wanted to dictate how these people doing their job. So I asked her, I said, "Rose, leave these people alone." So when I asked her that, she gets mad and cursed me out, and so she left. I stayed in there 35 days, she came to see me six days out of the 35. Oh, my God, he is so lying. And, also, when she did come, Yeah? the thing was, she was coming for money. "I need money to do this, I need money to do that." Oh, my God. She came to get stuff from you. This man never gave me no money. The reason why I was hooting and hollering was because they had species in a container and it wasn't his. And I know when you get a blood transfusion, you can catch all kind of bacteria. Right. That's what I was hooting and hollering about.

Announcer: Divorce Court is back with th who wants a divorce from her husband because she says she is tired of his philandering. But is the situation even worse than it seems? He do abusive stuff. What kind of abusive stuff does he do? How can you go and buy me a valentine gift with my money? When did that happen? Huh? Valentine's Day. I got that. I assume that part. But why don't you tell me what did he buy and how did he get your money to buy it? 'Cause I let him go and take care of some business for me. Right. And he had my money. And he went and gonna buy me something, "Don't be mad." I said, "Be mad about what?" "You'll see when I get there." When I get there, I see a teddy bear. He gonna surprise me with some candy. You know I don't eat no candy 'cause I I got to watch my figure. So he gonna bring that in like he did something wonderful. "Here, here's a teddy bear." With my money. You didn't have no money. Why would you...? I mean... Why would he buy something with your money? Yes! Mr. Lewis, would you like to respond? Your Honor, the relationship with Rose and her money, her money is gold. Mine is soda water tops. In other words, anything that belongs to Rose is Rose. Mine is ours. And that's just the way her attitude is about as far as my money. He don't want to pay bills, he don't want to do nothing. Your Honor, like I said, I have nerve damage. My pelvic bone is broken by my hip. Right. It put me in, like a man in a closet. I'm already physically unable to do a lot of things I used to do. I'm used to doing things to take care of myself. Stop! But she is so abusive. I don't do any cursing. I don't do any cursing. What good that's gonna do. You do abusive stuff. What kind of abusive stuff does he do? It's no different. He might as well curse. He don't pay no bills, he don't do nothing. Physically, mentally, he's a distraction to my life and the way I live. Mr. Lewis, you not gonna pay any bills? 

[00:12:17]


Your Honor, I need to respond to this immediately. Okay, go right ahead. The reason I am responding to you, we are separated. We're separated. Doesn't matter. You still got to pay bills. She saying I don't want to pay the bills. Your Honor, me and Ms. Hobbs doesn't stay together. That doesn't matter. I have my own apartment. And as far as about the abusiveness, I do not abuse women. Me and her, we don't have any physical altercation. I don't know why she say that abusive. Her verbal abuses... But her verbal abuses, you know what I'm saying? She calling me "cripple." She called me "snaggletooth." She call me... She called you what? "Cripple." She call me "Snaggletooth." Oh, snaggletooth. Yeah, "Little black" this here, that there. Do you call him a "little black" this here, that there? And this is the reason why I don't have any affection for her. or having any sexual... Judge, I hadn't tell him those things.

I mean, I was... This is his second marriage. Oh, come on, you made that up. No, this is... this is his second marriage. It is, Your Honor. Announcer: She's the judge who gives rules on the law and life. She's intense with common sense. She's Judge Lynn Toler. OnDivorce Court, where real couples deal with real life. Stephanie and Anthony have been married for three years and find themselves at a crossroads. Stephanie says she is fed up with Anthony's cheating and needs him to step up and take charge or get stepping. I am just sick and tired of the cheating. Stephanie had come in drunk and she was like, "Oh, please help me." And it would be like, 6:00 in the morning. Announcer: Can Anthony convince Stephanie that he is ready to grow up and provide for their family or will this relationship be finished for good? Today onDivorce Court. Bailiff: All rise! Court is now in session. The Honorable Judge Lynn Toler presiding. You may be seated. Good day, ladies and gentlemen. I'm here today with Stephanie McClendon and Anthony McClendon. The two of you have been married for three years. Mrs. McClendon, you are out. It's a wrap, it's over for you. Mr. McClendon, you'll do anything in the world to save this marriage. With us today, we also have Jannie Hill? Yes. You have some information with respect to what's going on here, and I will talk to you later. If we are not able to get this marriage turned in a way that we think it might progress, and you do want to continue on towards a divorce, there are some financial matters that you want me to resolve, and I will, in fact, do that at the end of the case. Before we get there, however, I'm gonna start with you, Mrs. McClendon. Why do you believe this relationship is over. 

[00:02:00]


I am just sick and tired of the cheating. The Internet cheating, for an example. I went on Facebook on the phone. His account was open, and I saw that he was trying to get with one of my friends that I've known for like, ten years. Now, when you say "get with," what kind of communications were they having? Um, he was asking her to come and piim up. He was telling her that he had a big penis. He was telling her that, you know, he wanted to do sexual favors for her. Um, so I was just... I was just done. I was... Mr. McClendon, were you on Facebook telling somebody about the size of your equipment? He sure was. He sure was. Yes, um... No, Mr. McClendon, let's just forget the fact that you're married for a hot second. 26 years old, really? Do you think that's necessary? I mean, that's schoolyard, "let me show you" behavior, don't you think? Yes. What was on your mind? I did ask he um, friend to give me a ride to work, and you know, 'cause me and Stephanie was... We wasn't, you know, communication... You weren't getting along. We wasn't getting along. You asked this person for a ride to work, and the next tng you know, you're telling her how big your situation is. Is this what you're telling me? Right. All right, then. Mrs. McClendon, tell me more about the Internet cheating. Another example, another example is one day, I pick up the phone, and I'm like, "Hello?" It's this girl, asking to speak to my husband. And so then, lateon I found out that she was around my kids. She had came to my house. Right. It's a lot going o Were you having a relationship with someone else to the extent that she was around you children? This is what happened, Your Honor. I had lost a lot of trust into my wife, and I started, you know... We weren't... we weren't getting along. It's a lot of excuses. 

[00:04:00]


And I was just like, okay, if you're not... Just not understanding. You know, like her drinking. You know, she would go out and just... just be drinking, and I stay home with the kids. I cook, you know, I clean. He drove me to drinking. Did you just hear the stuff I told you? So-so, Mrs. McClendon, so you're saying... You're saying you two didn't have an active, meaningful relationship because she was drinking and carrying on, but at the time... She was drinking, and I was with the kids all the time. Ms. Hall, come forward, please. I'm giving the opportunity. That's not true. Oh, you look like twins in here. Oh, wow. Like a singing group or something. Go ahead. Now, Ms. Hall, what do you know about the state of their rnship and what each one of them is doing? That's not true. Stephanie and Anthony have great times. They have time when we're all together, and they dance all night. Nobody else is dancing, but they enjoy each other. And it's really... it's cute. But Anthony has been caught, you know, socializing, chatting, texting, you know. And my cousin's the sole breadwinner for them. You know, so I feel like it's totally unfair. Like, I don't care how bored he is, he needs to respect her and her kids and take care of them. There's no time to talk to other girls on the phone or on Facebook. How does she know? Well, Mr. McClendon... I observe things. You know? Hang on, hang on. Go ahead. She does work a lot. She does work a lot. But I also get the kids ready for school. There was times where Stephanie had drunk, and I had to... she comes in drunk, and she was like, "Oh, please, help me." And it would be like, 6:00 in the morning. Then she'd be throwing up. I got to get up. I've been with the kids all day. I had to put them in bed, fed them and everything, and she would, "Oh, I'm so drunk." Then she'd come in sometimes and cuss me out. Can I say... Tell me about the liquor. 'Cause he seems to think you're a fall-down drunk. Okay, if I'm going out... My family, we're a close family, and I will ask him, "Do you mind keeping the kids for a couple of hours so I can go out?" Now, one time, yes, I did come back at 6:00 or 7:00 in the morning 'cause that's how we party. You know, but he was okay with it. 

[00:06:00]


Ms. Hall, are you part of that party? I am part of that party. We are first cousins. Because I didn't want to drink and drive. I'm not gonna lie to you, but... That's that one time. And you agreed with me. She is not... It's not obsessive like that. Now how often do you guys roll like that? Every week. Every week. Every week. Every week. Every week. Maybe once or twice on the weekend. Every week. Every week. Announcer: WhenDivorce Courtcontinues: Anthony admits to being unfaithful to his wife, but is Stephanie a cheater, too?

[00:09:24]


announcer: Divorce Court is back with the case of Stephanie McClendon who wants out of her marriage because she is convinced her husband is a cheater. But let's find out if Stephanie has been unfaithful, too. She was talking, you know, to this guy that was real secretive. Ms. McClendon, my understanding is you claim that he tried to get you fired once. Yes, ma'am. He sure did. Explain that to me. Um, I was at work. We had got into it over something, I really can't remember because it's been so many issues. He called my supervisor and told him I was taking care of this elderly lady for like, two years. I mean, me and her were really close. He called and told them that I forced her into one of the company vehicles and that I physically hurt her. And with me being at my job for so long, I mean, I had to call my boss and explain to her that, you know, we're tripping again and he's gonna call up here. And he just did that. Had nothing to do with anything? Exactly. Mr. McClendon, did you call her job and accuse her of doing something inappropriate with one of her clients? Yeah, um, I was very angry and upset. What were you angry about? I was upset and angry because she was like, we got into it, and she said, "I'm going to my brother's house to go be with them." And she didn't want me to come. You know, she didn't want me to come. She didn't want me to be around because we got into it. We weren't seeing eye to eye. And she wanted some time away. I guess she wanted some time to herself. So she left, and your response to that was get her fired? Yeah, I was being, you know, real childish Ridiculous. and ridiculous, ye I wasn't being a man. Straight up ridiculous. 'Cause that's cutting your own throat 'cause she keeps a roof over your head. Right. We got that all cleared up? Yes, yes. You won't be doing that anymore, right? Right, but, Your Honor, I also have We're all gonna be put out a job, and I do go to school, and I know Stephanie is the primary breadwinner because she makes, you know, a lot of hours. Hill: He has a job now. He doesn't keep a job. Now, Ms. Hall. I'm sorry. That's because I left. Because I left. Oh, that's right. You've been separated for a couple of weeks. 'Cause you broke camp. I was just fed up. But, okay... 

[00:11:24]


And I want to tell you about another situ!tion. Why only now? It seems to me that you only got a job once she left. Is that true? No, no, no, no, no, I always had plenty of jobs. I always, you know... "I have plenty of jobs." You know, that's not a good thing. When you have... it means you're losing a lot of jobs, and job jumping is not a good thing. Yeah. Why do you job jump? Are you not a good employee? No, that's not it. It's because, you know, sometimes I get up late, you know, because I've been with the family and the kids. Let me tell you something about that. That's not being a good employee. When you're late, that's not good employee. Right. That's why you get fired, all right? Right. (applause) And also, you know, another thing. My wife actually, when we was not getting along, she was talking, you know, to this guy that was real secretive. She was, you know, it was one particular day that she had walked outside. She held the phone like this on the side of her where I couldn't see it. So she was like, "Dang, can I get some privacy? I need some time to myself." Watching too hard. I can't even talk on my phone. But see... Did you have a man on the side? Was it a conversation you didn't want him to hear? She's laughing. That's why; she knew who it was. Yeah, she know. She know. I'm laughing beuse I cannot... I can't never have a conversation on the phone. Answer the question. I mean, he is sitting right there. Answer the question. No. You ain't gonna answer the question. I just told her no. Mr. McClendon, I can handle this all by myself. Really, I can. (applause) Okay. Was the person on the other end of the phone a male friend with whom you were having an inappropriate relationship? No. But it was a he? It was a he. And it's not a conversation you would've had with him in front of him, correct? ! Yes. Yeah, you had to think about it. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. It wasn't nothing. It wasn't anything like that, you know what I'm saying? It wasn't nothing like that.

Announcer: Divorce Court returns with the case of Stephanie and Anthony McClendon, who have been separated for a month, and are seeking a divorce after three years of marriage. Here's where we are. Now, Ms. Hall, sit down and be quiet this time. Don't say anything else. Okay, Judge. Okay. 'Cause this thing is over. Ms. McClendon, I like to save marriages if I can, but he's not ready. You know, he's gonna say what he needs to say to get what he wants, which is back in the house with you. I think he's with women 'cause they take care of them. I don't think he's quite okay on his own, and you hold down the fort, and he can be a little kid because he's on your time, he's on your dime, he's in your house. And he can be a kid, and I don't think he's ready. What I think... Doesn't mean you two can't be together, but you can't be together right now. He's got some growing up to do. He's got to earn his way back in the house, and that's not a phone call, that's not letters, that's not a rose. What it is is he needs to have a job six, seven, eight months. He needs to, you know, be consistent with you. Come over, and you can have two, three months go by without an argument, all of that. And unti he doesn't need to be back in the house. You with me on that one? (applause) And I know you love him, and I know you're gonna miss him, but you're doing the best thing for the both of you. It's to require him to grow up, 'cause people will do as little as you let them. Especially if they're not responsible. Mr. McClendon, you've got a whole lot of showing up to do. You have showed up tacky, wrong, sad, tired, loose, weak, and undone. You need to have a whole lot of things fixed. Tell me about this camera that came up missing, and you want me to have him reimburse you for. Yeah, so we got into it once again, um, and he would do silly stuff like that, so I know that he did it, you know. I had moved from another place I was staying at, 

[00:27:28]


and I had over 2,000 pictures on that camera. We got into an argument, you know. Next thing I know, two days later, my camera is gone. Did you take the camera, Mr. McClendon? Somebody was staying with us, watching our kids, and the camera was missing. I'm not gonna take it. Do you believe him, Mrs. McClendon? I'm not gonna take anything from you. I don't know what to believe with... Yeah, I don't know what to believe either. And when I don't know what to believe, the plaintiff can't recover. And I don't think it's worth it for you anyway. I think... I think what you need to do what you need to do. You have to fix who you talk to, where you go, what you do, your thoughts about your job and responsibility. Take some responsibility off of her shoulders. Leave the other women alone. There has to be some self restraint in your game. Right, but... And don't you take him back until he gets it done. Mr. McClendon, do you think you can handle that? Yeah, I love Stephanie. Love is a wonderful thing, but if don't do anything to back it up, it's meaningless. Right, right. Absolutely meaningless. You're right. You're right. You know, I can say I love you and just hit you all up in the head with a hammer. What good does it do? Right. Every time you don't bring home money, every time you see another woman, every time you get on that Facebook, every time, that's whooping her, just whooping her. And you can't, "But I love you, baby, but I love you ." It doesn't work out, okay? You're right. You're right. You hear me? I hear you. I hear you. There will be no recovery in this matter. It is so ordered. Bailiff: All rise! Parties may leave the courtroom. ANNOUNCER: Judge Toler's straight talk brought Anthony to tears in the greenroom after the show. However, as difficult as it was for Anthony to hear, the judge's criticism seems to have strengthened his marriage to Stephanie. Anthony has been holding down a job and getting to work on time, and he has been much better with the kids. Stephanie says that if things continue this way, she and Anthony will be able to save their marriage. Captioning sponsored by 20evision

Pbs station from viewers like you. Thank you. >> Don't you want to remove the fear of disease from your life and feel secure that you can fully enjoy your later years? >> A few simple changes in your lifestyle can change your health destiny. >> The theme of this program is that disease is unnatural. Health is the natural state which can only be realized with superior nutrition. >> "New york times" best-selling author dr. Joel fuhrman is a board certified family physician who specializes in preventing and reversing disease through nutritional and natural methods. >> What I'm telling you here is your immune system is the mastermind behind your body's ability to resist disease. >> Please join us for "dr. Fuhrman's immunity solution." (applause) >>Hank you. Hi, I'm dr. Fuhrman. I welcome you to dr. Fuhrman's immunity solution. Do you or someone you know have cancer, a relative or a friend maybe? Do you know someone suffering from headaches, allergies, or an autoimmune disease like arthritis? If your answer is yes, this is no coinciden. Our country's in severe health crisis that's tragic, even more tragic because most people don't know these illnesses don't have to be. This show gives a solution to the explosion of illnesses across america, and my goal is to inform you about the new most recent advances in modern nutritional science that can solve many of our nation's most serious health problems-- problems like autoimmune disease, life threatening infections and even cancer. Now I know if there was a way you ladies could protect yourself against breast cancer, you would, right? If I told you to drink a cup of 

[00:02:00]


green tea every day and that would give you 90% protection, wouldn't you do it? >> Yes. >> Of course, you would. It's not as simple as just a cup of green tea, but it is pretty simple, and I'm gonna give you the solution right here in this show. And I know if you men out there knew there was a magic bean you could eat and you would never have to worry about prostate or colon cancer, you'd certainly eat some of those beans, right? >> Yeah. >> If what I'm claiming is true and you really could protect yourself against cancer, against heart attacks and against dementia in later life, what would that protection be worth to you? Millns, right? >> Yes. >> Not even, it's priceless, something money can't buy. Well, on this show, I'm gonna give you this lifesaving information, and I'm claiming we can win the war on cancer in america with some simple steps, and I'm going to explain why i think this is so. This is a serious show because I'm talking about some serious problems. But it's very important you pay close attention and learn what I'm going to teach you today. You may even want to take notes. The information may prevent you from years of suffering and pain. It could even save your life. Having a powerful, fully functioning immune system can protect you from breast cancer, from prostate cancer, from colon cancer, from pancreatic cancer. Excluding lung cancer caused by smoking, those are the four most common cancers in america. And that's right, I'm making a radical claim. Here it is. We can win the war on cancer, and we can win it right now. Exactly what do I mean by win the war in cancer? I mean that werevent 90% or more of cancer deaths, and the science supporting this is strong, it's logical, and we can't wait any longer to put it into action because not acting is killing people, and not acting could even kill you. Before we review this evidence, I want to state that all the statements here are supported by scientific evidence, and my conclusions are not just the result of one study on any issue, but on many studies. People will try, but this 

[00:04:01]


information is impossible to deny. Look, that's fine if you are an informed adult and you want to smoke cigarettes and eat like other americans eat. That's your right. But I think everyone also has the right to at least know they have a choice to know they did not have to get demented with aging, to know they did not have to have that bypass surgery, did not have to have that heart attack and they did not have to get that cancer. Do what you want, but at least do so with your eyes fully opened armed with the right information, so you can choose to take control of your health destiny. This concept that we don't have to get cancer only seems outrageous because we've been misinformed that these diseases are inevitable ogenetic or that we have to be dependent on medical treatments like chemotherapy and invasive surgery. We've been brainwashed to accept that disease is to be expected and that medicines and medical treatments will save us. These most common cancers are a new delopment in human history. They've exploded to these high levels only in the last 50 to 75 years. We can also look at the dietary changes that have occurred i those countries where cancers used to be very low and it became high. The scientific studies are now demonstrating that a normal functioning immune system is dependent on certain foods, and when you eat those foods regularly, you protect yourself from cancer even developing. Vegetable consumption plummeted over the last hundred years in america, and refined or processed foods and sugars increased dramatically as our body weights increased dramatically, too. The standard diet most americans are eating today is simply deadly. Take a look at this graph that shows the increasing incidence of cansince 1940. Sadly the upward climb in cancer rates is continuing worldwide as those countries now eat like us and refined foods and fast foods have become available all over the world. But this show is not only about preventing cancer. This is about preventing and reversing autoimmune diseases 

[00:06:02]


that have also exploded in recent years. This explosion of autoimmune disease has matched the increased cancer incidents for THE 1940s TO THE 1990s. Let me give you an example of some common autoimmune diseases... And about a hundred more autoimmune illnesses and related immune system disorders such as asthma, allergies and fibromyalgia. Of course, when we eat a diet style that weakens immune system function, we allow cancer and we create an epidemic of autoimmune diseases from immune system malfunction. Look at the skyrocketing increase in lupus in the last 50 years. Autoimmune illness, where our own immune system attacks us, is now the third leading class of illness in america after hardening of the arteries or arterial sclerosis and cancer. And autoimmune disease has the same nutritional causes as cancer. These diseases are not predominantly genetic. Environmental and nutritional factors simply overwhelm genetics. How could autoimmune disease and the most common cancers be mostly genetic if they were both relatively rare in past generations and in other parts of the world? How could they be mostly genetic if there's so little of these diseases in asia? Yet when the asian population moves to america and eats our diet style, the same cancers double or triple in one generation. Colorectal cancer risk in chinese immigrants increases with the number of years they live in north america. This exposure to a richer diet with more meat, more oil, more sugar, more refined foods triggers both heart disease and cancer. An asian woman born in the u.S. Will have more than a 60% higher rate of getting breast cancer compared to a woman born in asia. And this instance of breast cancer was more than ten times 

[00:08:02]


the instance of breast cancer in asia 50 years ago. Let's look at some of this data in more detail. First, let's look at the death rate from breast cancer in VARIOUS COUNTRIES IN THE 1960s. Note how in 1967, japan, china, dominican republic and even mexico had only about one-tenth the breast cancer deaths compared to the u.S. And northern europe. Now let's go from 1967 and look at breast cancer incidence in korea in 1988. Wow, still only one-tenth the rate we see in america at that time. Fascinating. Now let's go from 1988 to 2008. Just 20 years later, and breast cancer incidence quadrupled in korea over that time frame. What do you think happened to the korean diet just a few years before this radical explosion of breast cancer? Well, let's take a look. Now do you see how their diet changed? Wow, animal products and sugar consumption more than doubled, and the consption of oils are now eight times as high as they were in 1978. What do animal products, oils, and refined foods like sweeters have in common to promote cancer? Well, they're all foods that do not contain anticancer antioxidants and phytochemicals, and they're foods that raise cancer promoting hormones. What happened was the diet was becoming more americanized like in other parts of the world, and as the diet becomes more like ours, cancer rates become more like ours, too. Let's take a look at the american diet because it's perfectly designed to cause cancer and heart disease. It's not only sad--it is sad. It's s.A.D., The standard american diet, s.A.D. It's very sad because it's deadly. So take a look at this pie chart of what americans are eating. That's about 26% of calories from animal products and over 60% of calories from refined foods such as oil, white bread, 

[00:10:02]


sweets, candies, fast foods, chips, and soda. Not only do refined and processed foods not contain those antioxidants and phytochemicals that fight cancer, but they're high glycemic foods that ragar in the bloodstream, spiking your insulin levels, and insulin is a hormone that is cancer promoting in excess. More flour, white rice, sugar means more insulin and more cancer. And as the animal products increased from small amounts in the diet to larger amounts, cancer rates have been shown to increase as well. This is not a questionable finding. Animal products are similar to refined processed foods in that they also do not contain antioxidants and phytochemicals. And the more of them you eat, the more fruits and vegetables you don't eat. But there's something more. One important mechanm we have discovered irecent years is that as animal products increase over 5% to 10% of total calories, we see the cancer promoting hormone igf-1, insulin-like growth factor one, increased dramatically. And igf-1 is another powerful cancer promoting hormone. It's well established in the scientific literature that... What I'm saying here is that white rice and white bread is like a piece of chicken because they both promote cancer as the amount of processed foods get too high as the amount of animal products too high. So why is a piece of chicken like a slice of white bread? That's right. One, because neither one contains any significant amount of anticancer nutrients called antioxidants and phytochemicals. And two, because both promote hormones that increase the risk of cancer. Certainly there's a threshold effect, meaning a small amount of animal products or a small amount of refined grain such as white rice won't likely promote cancer. 

[00:12:03]


When you paser that threshold, we start to see a stronger and stronger negative effect as these foods rise in the diet. Of course, that threshold could be moved up or down based on your needs. A lower threshold is in order if you have a serious illness you're trying to reverse, and lots of americans are suffering with serious immune system disorders. And the number is continuing to rise. Not only can all this human suffering be prevented, what if you already have one of those troubling illnesses? Should you take drugs to control the symptoms the rest of your life, drugs that are known to cause serious side effects and increase risk of cancer? That's right. I'm saying you can get better even recover without drugs. Autoimmune disease is one of the top causes of death in women younger than 65. Lupus incidents tripled in the UNITED STATES BETWEEN THE 1950s AND 1990s. And death from lupus increased 60% in the 20-year period from 1980 to 2000. Multiple sclerosis and rheumatoid arthritis had similar increases in incidents. Is this genetic? Obviously not. Yet as the amount of human suffering and deaths has been climbing, the medical profession has largely ignored looking at dietary causation. This just doesn't have to be. You know, I can say this because of studies done in the medical literature that has documented the results with nutritional methods, and I can say this because cancer and autoimmune illness are virtually unknown in areas of the world where they eat enough immune supporting foods. And I can say this because of my 20-year history with people utilizing a nutritional approach, watching thousands reverse their chronic medical conditions that they were told were irreversible and had nothing to do with food-- like karen schroeder from ocean grove, new jersey. In 2005, karen's joints became 

[00:14:05]


very stiff and fatigued and she developed severe pain in her feet, ankles, hips, wrists, and elbows. She was diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis and that began the onslaught of medications. She was told she had to take these medications for the rest of her life, and there were no alternatives. And over the next six years, karen took prednisone, plaquenil, alzulfidine and methatrexate. By 2010, she had worsening side effects. Her white blood cell counts had dropped too low, and she had frequent infections. Her liver enzymes were elevated, and she had gastric and esophageal burning and nausea. She finally had to tell her doctors she'd rather live in pain than suffer with so many medications side effects and higher risk of cancer from medication. Then in january 2011 while searching the internet, karen read about people who'd recovered from rheumatoid arthritis using my immunity solution, and she felt hopeful for the first time in six years. She weaned off all of her medication and followed the plan to the letter. And here's karen's statement. Now you mit not have rheumatoid arthritis like karen, and certainly not every person is able to achieve a complete remission, but now that you can see the healing potential that most medical doctors completely neglect, you can start to get impressed about the ability of a well-nourished human immune system to protect itself against disease and even reverse disease. See, when you eat the right 

[00:16:07]


foods and don't eat the wrong foods, you get well. I told you it was simple, didn't i? >> Yes. >> Nevertheless, these are not isolated instances. These benefits are regularly observed. Let me show you another person who recovered from a serious autoimmune illness. Jodie o'neill from kary, north carolina. Jodie first came to me over ten years ago suffering from psoriatic arthritis, lupus, and autoimmune disease called sjogrens's syndrome. She started experiencing joint pains and skin rashes as a teenager. She was on serious medication and steroids for over 20 years, and she still had psoriasis over here entire body, itching, poor mobility and joint pains not adequately relieved by her medications. She had lesions in her scalp, on her eyelids, inside her ears, and the skin was peeling off her hands and feet. She was a mess. She began my protocol in 2001, and after 30 days the itchiness subsided, and within six months, the entire body was free of psoriatic lesions. Without any effort, she lost 32 pounds, and she's kept those 32 pounds off the last ten years. But her ovarian cyst disappeared. She no longer has osteoporosis. She no longer has chronic sinus infections and congestion and nasal drip, and now at age 62, jodie regained her lost youth and can vigorously exeise and participate in all that healthy active lifestyle has to offer. I know that you want that for your life, too, right? 

[00:30:24]


>> Welcome back to "the immunity solution." This show is aintroduction to the latest nutritional science that can enable your immune system to function at full potential. The immunity solution can reduce your risk of infection, and if you do get sick, it can enable you to bounce back quickly and prevent any damage to your body. The immunity solution can enable to recover from chronic illnesses, even those your doctors may have told you are irreversible. It'll drop your blood pressure and cholesterol, so you no longer need medications and can take away your pain from headaches, arthritis, esophagitis and gastritis no matter what your age is. It can enable you to earn a high quality disease-free life your entire life. In order to activate this miraculous self healing, self repairing powers of your immune system, you need to eat a diet style that offers you comprehensive micronutrient adequacy. Micronutrients are those nutrients needed by the body that do not contain calories. We're not consuming them for energy, like fat, carbohydrates and protein. Those are macronutrients. We are consuming micronutrients because our body requires these immune system activators. There are literally thousands of important phytochemicals concentrated in colorful natural foods. We need to get them from the real food that contain them because some of the synthetic forms of micronutrients found in supplements can actually promote cancer. For example, take folic acid. We've observed in multiple modern studies that folic acid supplementation could increase the risk of certain cancers, especially breast cancer. We need the real folate found in green vegetables, not the fake folic acid found in supplements. So phytochemicals are not 

[00:32:24]


optional. They're essential. It's not important for you to kn the names of all these phytochemicals because there's thousands of them. But these compounds in green, brown, orange, red, black, blue foods, the full rainbow of natural plant foods, they work like a perfectly synchronized orchestra to enable protection against disease, protect against dementia and even slow the aging process. We discovered some fascinating science about viral infections in recent years as well. We found out that when you don't get enough phytochemicals, a simple virus can mutate and become more dangerous, more virulent. When a persois hospitalized with a dangerous infection, dangerous infection of their heart called a viral cardiomyopathy or a serious infection causing paralysis to their nervous system called guilliane-buree syndrome, we used to thin "oh, how terribly unlucky, this person must've caught this very rare virus that attacked the heart or the nerves." But now we know it's a relatively common virus. It's just a coxsackie virus that can mutate to become dangerous when nutritional deficiencies are present. In the environment of cma, comprehensive micronutrient adequacy, there would be no such attack on the heart, and the ordinary virus would've remained ordinary, unable to mutate to evade immune capture and to become dangerous to the heart or the rest of the body. When your immune system is running on all cylinders, you're not going to be at such risk for recurring sinus infections, ear infections, bronchial infections, and skin infections, and your digestion, headaches, allergies and asthma will improve, too. You know, we have a real healthcare crisis in america, and it's not going to be solved by politicians in washington. We need a population that's highly educated about nutrition, a population that's fully informed, that knows how to protect themselves from diseases. We need a healthy population that requires little medical care. Please remember, I'm not saying that doctors and hospitals don't ever serve a valid function. 

[00:34:25]


I'm a medical doctor myself. It's just we've come to rely on medicines and medical procedures instead of taking responsibility for our own health and following simple and powerful methods such as my immunity solution. Remember, the problem from our consumption of refined foods such as white flour products, oils, and white sugar are not that they're just fattening, they cause immune system malfunction. They cause damage, and that means chronic disease and cancer. And not only do animal products and refined foods not contain cancer protective antioxidants and cancer protective phytochemicalst they're also the foods that promote the cancer causing hormones in the body to rise. And these refined foods and animal products have increased as a percentage of calories in all areas of the world. And correspondingly we see, cancer and heart attack death rates increase in direct proportion. Take a look at this slide where I plotted the amount of natural plant food like fruits and vegetables, beans, seeds, and nuts against the deaths from heart disease, cancer and diabetes. The data demonstrates an interesting pattern where natural produce was low, heart disease and cancer rates are extremely high. Where produce consumption was very high, cancer and heart attackses were very, very low, and this is considering the same age group, this 55-75 age group among all these countries. When natural plant food intake is high enough, cancers and heart disease deaths almost disappeared. Now this slide would not look anything like this if I had used 2000 or 2010 statistics. It's based on 1970 data that was COLLECTED IN THE 1960s. That's about 50 years ago. Back then it was possible to find countries eating high amounts of natural plant foods. But even one decade later, america's commercial food interests were spreading everywhere, and the diets of people almost the entire world over were changing for the 

[00:36:26]


worse. These diseases of nutritional origin were increasing everywhere. Plus, the animal products we eat today are not the same as the wild animals eaten in yesteryear. Today's factory farmed animals are sickly overfed fattened animals fed junk food, given growth hormones and antibiotics. That's right. They're fed junk food like candy, pretzels, and chips that are damaged during manufacturing and broken and deemed not fit for humans. Actually, all that junk food isn't fit for humans. It's actually poisonous and cancer causing, but nevertheless, we feed this stuff to animals, so now we're eating junk food and junk food animals, too. My health equation is... This equation means your long-term health and how disease resistant you are is proportional to the micronutrient density of your diet. Health is nutrients divided by calories. Nutritional science is not just interesting, it's the most important subject we need to educate ourselves about because our health is just that important. Always keep this in your mind. You eat for health by eating more foods that give you a high micronutrient bang per caloric buck. Now this means not only just the high amount of these micronutrients, but the breadth, the variety of micronutrients. We're talking here about how we extend human lifespan by achieving comprehensive micronutrient adequacy, and that means every peg is filled of every micronutrient we need. And you know what the most important micronutrient that you might need to extend your life, the important micronutrient you need to ta to make sure you live longer? The most important one is th one you're missing. So we got to make sure you get all of them. That's the whole point here. Okay, so what I've done here is we've looked at studies, and we see that when people eat less, they live longer. And when animals are fed less food, their telomeres, that's a part of the cell that can 

[00:38:26]


shorten or lengthen or stay long, tells you how fast you're aging and how long you're gonna live. And we find that animals that eat less calories, their telomeres stay longer, they don't shrink as they age, so we're slowing the aging process. When we eat less calories, reducing free radical activity, it suppresses genetic defects and genetic alteration it inhibits the production of cross linking agents and toxins in the cells. So the cell can keep itself clean, it can slow the aging process, and you can live longer and keep your youthful vigor when you consume less calories. But the secret to consuming less calories is not just willy-nilly trying to eat less food, it's getting back to eating foods rich in micronutrients. Because when you eat foods that are rich in micronutrients, then it naturally suppresses the appetite where you're not gonna want to eat as much. So this is not about artificially trying to starve yourself, it's trying to eat more foods that have a high micronutrient per calorie density. The more high micronutrient foods you eat, the less low micronutrient foods you desire. So this program is predominately about eating more high micronutrient foods. Now wouldn't you like to get to your ideal weight without dieting? >> Yes. >> Wouldn't you like to not have to worry about your weight for the rest of your life... >> Yes. >> And wipe out the risk of serious disease in the process? >> Yes. >> Of course, you do. We all need this information. It will benefit you, and it'll benefit your loved ones. So I've scored most foods with my andi scoring system, which gives you a great tool to easily identify the most nutrient rich foods. Now andi, a-n-d-i stands for... What I did was measure up all the measurable micronutrients in an equal caloric portion, so an accurate comparison can be made of one food to another. Note how greens, berries, 

[00:40:27]


tomatoes, onions, mushrooms, seeds, and even some fruits score pretty high in micronutrients. You see the immunity solution is simple. We flipped the american diet from 10% high nutrient foods and 90% low nutrient foods to 90% high nutrient foods and 10% low nutrient foods. And we do that flip, we make it taste great. You try to eat more foods high in micronutrients and phytochemicals and you automatically desire less calories, you automatically lose the addictive drive to overeat, and you lose weight and you keep it off forever. We eat a diet that tastes better, that feels better and that protects us from dangerous infections, autoimmune illnesses, heart attacks, strokes, dementia, and cancer. Look, if you're still living, and I assume you are if you're watching this show... (laughter) That it's not too late to prolong ur life. It's not too late to have a better quality life. So many people have thrown in the towel. They've accepted the negative outcomes predicted by their doctors. This is not for somebody else. This is for you. Whether you're sick or well at this time, don't wait until some serious disease develops. Protect yourlf now. You think about saving for financial needs later in life, but what good is that if you're not well enough or even alive to enjoy it? Your good health is ur greatest wealth. The savings you need to put into your health bank account are those protective nutrients that contue to work in your body every day to protect you against disease. The theme of this program is that disease is unnatural. Health is the natural state, which can only be realized with superior nutrition. I've had so many hundreds of people who've contacted me after watching my last public television program, "three steps to incredible health." Though last year's show was focused more on weight loss, not on the immune system, it changed the lives of thousands of seriously ill people. Don't you want great health and 

[00:42:28]


everytng life has to offer? Becoming knowledgeable about superior nutrition is a blessing that can give us a better, longer and a more pleasurable life. Don't forget I said more pleasurable because you can't enjoy life when you're sick. And food even tastes best when you have a healthy appetite and a healthy hunger, ur taste improves. You enjoy eating more when you eat healthfully. What I'm telling you here is that your immune system is the mastermind behind your body's ability to resist disease. You don't just develop serious diseases or get cancer overnight or even in a few years. It doesn't happen from something you did ten years ago. It's a slow process of gradually increasing cellular damage that takes many decades of immune system weakness.

>> We're back with "dr. Fuhrman's immunity solution." >> Thank you. Welcome back to the "immunity solution." And this is part three, the fun part of the show where we get to talk about food. As if I wasn't talking about it already, right? Now I want you to learn two important new words. Words that I made up-- nutritarian and g-bombs. I want you to eat a nutritarian diet. That's a diet that's strives for nutritional excellence. ...Is a nutritarian. And my goal is to have you enjoy life to the fullest as a practicing nutritarian. I insist it'll make your life more enjoyable, not just disease resistant. Now keep in mind, a vegetarian or a vegan could also be a nutritarian if the diet is designed healthfully. And a person who eats some animal products could also be a nutritarian if their diet is designed healthfully. A nutritarian learns about the most powerful healing foods and consumes them regularly. The second word I want you to learn is g-bombs. G-bombs--g, b, o, m, b, s. It's an acronym that helps you remember the super foods you need to eat regularly to drive the immunity solution. These are the foods richest in anticancer phytochemicals that we don't get enough of in the s.A.D.--The standard american diet. Foods that contain nutrits essential to the immunity solution. So let's talk about green vegetables first. The consumption of raw greens has been proven to reduce cancer rates in more than 200 separate scientific studies. In each of our cells is a dna 

[01:08:57]


sequence called the antioxidant response element. It's like a protective force field around the ship in star trek. Your cells have this anticancer force field and it's fueled by green vegetables. And the greens that have the most powerful fuel for the cells protective function are-- examples of cruciferous vegetables are-- for example, in a recent medical study, men who ate 28 servings of vegetables a week, decreased their instance of prostate cancer by 33%. However, if they ate just three servings of cruciferous vegetables a week, they decreased the occurrence of prostate cancer by 41%. That's three servings of cruciferous, more powerful than 28 servings of regular vegetables. The more cruciferous vegetables consumed, the lower the rate of cancer. This is partularly true of breast cancer. A recent study showed that the daily intake of cruciferous vegetables decreased breast cancer deaths by 62%, compared to women who did not eat cruciferous vegetables. And this radical decrease in deaths from breast cancer is even observed in women who already have a diagnosis of of breast cancer. Amazing isn't it? Don't you think every person should learn about this and know this? >> Yes. >> A group of powerful compounds from cruciferous vegetables that offers this protection is called ISOTHIOCYANATES OR ITCs. There are over 120 different TYPES OF ITCs, AND THEY HAVE Different effects on the cell to move carcinogens and repair defects that could lead to cancer. What is fascinating is that THESE ITCs ARE NOT IN THE Vegetable yet before you eat it. But as you chew it, the cell wall of the vegetable releas an enzyme called myrosinase THAT FORMS THE ITCs IN YOUR Mouth before you even swallow. 

[01:10:57]


If you chop or blend the veggies well, you will have the same effect to form these compounds. So the better these vegetables are chewed, the better they're chopped or blended, more BENEFICIAL ITCs ARE RELEASED Into the body. The next super food I want you to eat is beans. Scientists discovered a new potent anticancer compound in this fun to eat food. And the name of this compound is long, actually 26 letters long, and it's so hard to pronounce, so it must be important. It's-- this compound was found to inhibit a key enzyme involved in tumor growth. That's right. When you eat beans regularly, they prevent tumors from forming in the body. Plus, they're rich in anticancer polyphenols. Accordingly, a recent study showed that men who ate beans or legumes regularly had a 40% lower risk of prostate cancer. And numerous studies show beans dramatically cut colon cancer risk, too. A 6-year study tracking over 32,000 individuals found those who ate beans, peas or lentils only twice a week decreased their risk of colon cancer by 50%. Wow! If they cut their chance of colon cancer in half by ting beans twice a week, imagine the benefits of eating beans daily. You may not have any friends left, but at least you won't get canc. Seriously, though, if you do eat beans on a regular basis, your body builds up the bacteria you need to digest them, and you don't get the indigestion and gas. The other fascinating thing about beans is that they're very high in fiber and resistant starch. Resistant starch is resistant to being digested and that means that lots of the carbohydrate calories in beans do not get absorbed by the body. They just pass through us, making beans a very weight-loss favorable food. That's right, about half the carb calories in beans do not get absorbed. So beans make you feel full, they stabilize your blood sugar, they protect you against cancer, and they help you lose weight. 

[01:12:59]


Onions are next. Who would have imagined that onions could be so protective against cancer? A multi-country european study tracked the consumption of food and cancer and found the one most protective variable for prostate cancer was onions. And the strongest causative factor was animal product consumption, specifically meat and dairy. Now if we look at all the studies on prostate cancer, we find that tomatoes get all the publicity because they're about a hundred studies showing a protective effect of tomatoes on prostate cancer. Now even though there may not be as many studies done on onions and cancer, but if you look at the strength of the effect in those studies, we find that onions have even a stronger, more protective effect than tomatoes do. Pooling numerous studies from 37 different countries on onions and cancer, we find between 50% and 88% reduction in the instance of various cancers. And some of the green vegetables, the green cruciferous vegetables, when you cut the onion, it causes a chemical reaction to occur. And the same reaction that creates the acid that makes your eyes burn, is a reaction that forms these organosulfide compounds with their powerful anticancer effects. So the point to remember here is that the enzyme is heat sensitive. So to increase the cancer fighting power of onions in your diet, you want to eat some raw onion and chew them very well. If you cook the onion, and then cut it up or blended it, then it won't give off that gas that makes your eyes tear. So you won't produce those anticancer compounds. But if you chop it or blend it first, when it's raw, you can still cook the onion after and maintain most of the benefits because the organosulfide compounds are not to destroyed by cooking. You just have to make sure you chop it up really fine before you cook it so those organosulfide compounds are formed before cooking. Do you follow that? >> Yes. >> All right, now guess-- who is the king of the cancer fighting all-stars? NOPE, NOT LeBRON JAMES. >> (audience laughs) >> It's mushrooms. Mushrooms have three important 

[01:15:00]


and unique cancer defenses. First, they contain-- antigen-binding lectins. That means they stick to the surfaces of abnormal cells so the body can recognize and attack those cells removal before they become cancerous. Fascinating isn't it? >> (audience) YES. >> Our immune system has the ability to fully recognize abnormal cells and remove them, but only when it becomes fully activated when you eat mushrooms. The second important cancer fighting feature of mushrooms is that they're strong angiogenesis inhibitors. That means these compounds inhibit new blood vessel growth. See in order for a tumor to grow, in order for cells to become cancerous, and spread they have to send out signals that create new blood vessels to grow and feed them with nutrients and oxygen. And mushrooms say, no way. They inhibit the enzymes released by abnormal cells. That promote blood vessel growth thereby restricting the oxygen and nutrients from getting to those cells. So these substances derived from mushrooms starve off tumors and cancers. And the fat on your body is also like a tumor. It secretes hormones that stimulates growth of blood vessels also. The fat can't grow without a delivery system of highways that bring it more calories and mushrooms stop that delivery. They won't let fat grow easily on your body either. The third important protective feature of mushrooms is they contain aromatase inhibitors. These compounds prevent the body from making excess estrogen. And they protect the breast tissue from being stimulated from circulating estrogen. Now because of this, mushrooms are powerfully protective against breast cancer. It's as if mushrooms are a necessary armor for our immunity system. Look, your car needs gas and oil, and your immune system needs greens, onions and mushrooms, or it simply is not going to function normally. So let's move on to berries. I love that berries taste great, they're certainly a great diet and weight loss food. As they're also so low in calories they even have a low glycemic load for a diabetic. 

[01:17:02]


But did you know that berries can slow ageing of the berries and prevent dementia? Did you know berries have powerful anticancer benefits? Ellagic acid and anthocyanins are prominent phytochemicals in berries that inhibit the growth of abnormal cells and cancer cells. One recent study gave strawberry concentrates to patients with esophagus cancer and found that the cancerreversed or stopped progressing. Amazingly, anticancer potential here is even surprising the researchers involved in these studies who've reported to me that this is a hotbed of recent excitement. What's observed is that we can almost wipe out cancers in animals genetically prone to get the cancers, when a mixture of these particular super foods are put together and fed to these animals. So the last on your g-bombs list right, g, b, o, m, b, s, the last on your list, is seeds. Don't forget those seeds every day. Numerous studies on seeds and lignans derived from seeds is simply spectacular, and it's important you know about it. I'll just give you the results of two important studies. You'll get the point. A double blinded placebo controlled trial with flaxseed was done where they gave women who had breast cancer a flax seed containing muffin each day. And, of course, half the women in the study got a muffin that looked just like that, but didn't have the flaxseeds. And six weeks later, the breast cancer tumors were biopsied and analyzed, and they found significant cancer cell death and regression of cancer proliferation, which means the growth of the cancer, in the group that had the flax. Another study on the lignans from seeds studied women who had breast cancer and they tracked the amount of lignans consumed, over a 10-year period. You see, lignans are rich in flaxseeds, chia seeds, some other seeds, the women who ate the most lignans which was less than 1 milligram a day had a 71% decrease in breast cancer mortality over that 10-year period. Now one teaspoon of flax or chia 

[01:19:02]


seeds have about 7 milligrams of lignans, and in the study less than 1 milligram decreased breast cancer deaths by over 70%. That's truly amazing. So here's my nutritarian prescription for you. Number one-- do you eat some beans every day? You should. I wa you to. Check that off. It's important. Do you eat least a cup of berries and two other fruits a day? Are you having three fresh fruits a day? You got to check it off. It's one thing you have to do. It's part of the formula here. Now that 1 ounce of raw nuts and seeds, I want an half an ounce from--i want at least a tablespoon of chia seeds or sesame seeds or flaxseeds hemp seeds, I want at least a tablespoon of those seeds to get the lignans you need. I want some of those nuts and seeds to be some walnuts if possible for the omega-3 fatty acids. Have all the seeds and nuts you want, have the types you want, but have some of the hemp, chia, flax, or some walnuts for those mega-3 fatty acids, and then have some other nuts and seeds, pistachio nuts, pecans, you kn, mac--whatever you want, and I'm gonna give you incredibly great recipe ideas for this, too. One big salad, I want a sign on your refrigerator that says that salad is the main dish. Take out a marker, make a nice sign and--at least one of the meal, make the salad as the main dish--a big salad. Chop up the veg--the lettuce and the cabbage and the tomatoes and the red onion, put a delicious nut-based dressing on it, make a delicious tasting salad, kiwis or strawberries, or cherry tomatoes or sun dried tomatoes in there, make a roasted garlic dressing. One of my favorite dressings has roasted garlic, almonds whipped up a little tomato sauce a little fig vinegar or balsamic vinegar, whipped up, tastes fantastic on a salad. Okay, so at least one nice salad every day, and the half a cup of beans, you can dump it right on top of the salad if you want. 

[01:21:02]


Have at least one double size portion, maybe at night. Maybe you're havinsoup and a sad with lunch and a big serving of greens and a fruit bowl for dinner, or a small salad for dinner, but have a serving, maybe with mushrooms or some green vegetable, like asparagus, like broccoli, cabbage, artichokes. String beans, broccoli, have a nice serving of cooked greens every day. And don't forget check off on your list, have some mushrooms or onions every day. You goal is to have half a cup of onions a day, and mushrooms, you just need a little bit, just a small amount every day, just have some every day on a regular basis. They're tremendously protective. So what happens when you do this? Let's look at some people who tried it. Consider tom deck from rochester, new york. Tom was an overweight food addict and most of his life he weighed 365 pounds. He had high blood pressure and was diabetic for over 40 years. And as a result of this severe out of control diabetes, he had a toe amputated. He developed severe nausea and exhaustion and was found to have acute renal failure. He was told he was close to having to be put on dialysis. Then he was in bed watching my show, and tom said it was an answer to his prayers and those of his family, and his friends thought he wasn't gonna make it. Tom lost 56 pounds in the first five months and amazingly never felt deprived. And he says he enjoyed eating more than any time in his life. And he didn't have to count calories and measure food. Remember, he'd been a food addict his whole life. And he never could stick to any diet before. Tom was taking 12 prescription medications daily and injecting himself with insulin four times each day. Soon his type 2 diabetes was gone, so tom said, "my kidney doctor was practically jumping up and down during my last visit. I was a former food addict, and if I can succeed and enjoy dr. Fuhrman's program with all my problems, anybody can. I hope this letter can give help 

[01:23:02]


and hope to the millions of people who are searching for an answer. To wrap it up, all my many health problems have been a thing of the past. And within a month after starting, I have boundless energy. I weigh less than half of what I used to weigh. And my doctors are all saying what has happened is almost a miracle." It's not a miracle. It just demonstrates the power of mod

. Ali velshi takes over our coverage next. Xx 
>>> breaking news, I'm ali velshi in for erin burnett. The house has passed the deal, largely on party lines. In the end house lawmakers agreed to vote on the bill exactly as written. Now, here is some of what is in that proposal. Tax rates stay the same for couples making less than $450,000. A cap on itemized deductions for married couples making more than $300,000, a one-year extension on unemployment insurance, anne crease in estate tax from 35% to 40%, and the alternative minimum tax would be permanently adjusted for inflation. There are some big items the bill doesn't address. There is no mention of the debt ceiling, the government's $16.4 trillion borrowing limit which was reached yesterday and the bell does kick the can for about two months, the automatic sequester, which are set to take effect tomorrow. Joining me now, dana bash. Tell us what happened and what some of the more interesting votes have been. 
>> Reporter: Just moments ago we got the final vote. It was 257 yes and 167 no. This happened with a majority of democrats supporting this and relatively healthy number of republicans but certainly most republicans voted against this. One of the republicans who did not vote against it was the leader of the republicans, the house speaker. He voted yes. It is significant for two runs. One it is the tradition for speakers not to take votes. They do it when they want to make a point symbolically and that is clearly what the house speaker wanted to do here. He wanted to vote for a piece of legislation which he clearly knows is not perfect but is important when it comes to compromise and keeping tax cuts in place for 98% of americans. The other point is that paul ryan, the former vice presidential candidate and somebody who there is a lot of buzz about for 2016, he also voted yes, which is maybe a little bit surprising because other republicans who are being talked about as a presidential candidate the next time around, they have to run in the republican primary process and voting for anything that could be perceived as a tax increase is not what you want to do. It's noteworthy, paul ryan, the house budget chair, also voted yes for this. So it is the end of a long and trying day for house republfor everybody in the house and the next stop will be the president's desk. 

[00:03:09]


>> We were under the impress when it passed at 2:00 in the morning, it was going to go to the house, the house leadership, republican leadership was in favor. TjEN WE GOT A CLUE EARLY TODAY From eric cantor that he didn't like the bill. He in the end did not vote in favor of it. He voted nay. 
>> Correct. He voted no and another member of the leadership, evin McCARTHY, THE WHIP, HE ALSO Voted know. So they were split inside the leader. I think the big issue today wasn't necessarily within the republican leadership. It wasn't so much as split there. It was a lot of concern and discontent among all of the rank and file republicans that they were put in a position where they had to vote for something. They had to look at it fast. They didn't love this compromise and the house republicans, as we know well, are not used to voting on something that they don't see as pure and so it took a little while as a republican source earlier said to me for them to wind themselves up this morning and then slowly to wind themselves back down and accept reality, which is what we just saw. 
>> No one there owes themselves any congratulations. This took place 518 days after we first learned this fiscal cliff would take place. This was an embarrassing moment for america but the fiscal cliff has been averted. Dana, excellent reporting. Let's go to jessica yellin, who also has been standing by and watching this very carefully. I think because of what an embarrassing situation this has been, the president, jessica, has to be very careful as to how he plays this now. Does he come out and make a speech? Does he claim a victory? 
>> In fact, he will come out tonight, ali. The president will come out here in the press briefing room. We moved in here a little while ago suspecting that this might happen. In fact, the guys are coming out to put the presidential seal on the podium. He will speak at 11:20 eastern time. That's ten minutes from now. And deliver a statement, I'm told, which when they give the guidance that way, it means don't expect him to answer your question when is you shout them at him but can you try. I just want to remind you that he first sat down with congressional negotiators on NOVEMBER 16th, JUST AFTER HE WAS Reelected to first begin discussions to get a deal on avoiding the fiscal cliff and he began those discussions to have a grand bargain then. You remember it went into that process to negotiate it with speaker boehner and then you know hough it's unwound all this time. So this has been, as you point out, a months' long process and tonight I don't think he'll take a chest thumping victory lap but I do think that he will call it a victory. 

[00:06:02]


>> The president took some heat yesterday for comments that he made that some thought were inappropriate or the tone was inappropriate. He's got to watch tone at this point? 
>> Yeah. I mean, yes and no. He -- I don't expect him to adopt the same tone. He's speaking in front of reporters, he's not speaking in front of an audience of supporters and so the mood is different. And he will be probably if I had to guess, I was looking up some of his speeches from the campaign where he said, you know, the goal -- we will decide this issue during the campaign. I believe he'd say the tax cuts should be extended for middle class americans but the wealthiest must pay more and this issue will be decided by this election and that will be the end. And so he is -- I wouldn't be surprised if he sort of wrapped up that message tonight and said this was decided by the election and now it is resolved and I is right. So that's the tone he would take and he will probably pitch fod to the next fight which you've been talking about. 
>> There are several next fights coming up. We have the debt ceiling, the sequester and at some point we might have a fight about a budget in this country. Let's bring in our panel, john avalon, this has cost america, this has cost people in stock market performance last week, the s&p 500 was up more than 15% for the year. It closed the year 13.5% because of this uncertainty. People are going to -- we're going to have three more of these fights. This isn't a moment for anybody to be celebing anything whatsoever. 
>> No. We've avoided a huge self-inflicted wound to the american economy. I suppose congress can give themselves a mild pat on the back for that. Our strategics competitors around the world like china must have been watching around the world and laughing. This is not how -- we had 518 days to anticipate the sequester cuts. At the end of the day this is a compromise on a tax portion. We're going to be all here again dealing with the issues of deficit and debt with that debt ceiling. This is kicking the can. It's a patch that should leave most folks on the center right. The fact the republicans have voted 2-1 against them speaks to the challenges to governing in the house. 

[00:08:39]


>> What's the explanation for that? This has now cost american real money. If republicans wanted to deal with this properly, why didn't we do it in the first 3517 days? 
>> I think there was a lot of resistance from both side. You had nancy pelosi and chuck schumer calling for a million dollars threshold in 2011 because both party have a lot of fizziers in terms of aflant voters versus less affluent voters. The republicans are ideologically committed to entitlement reform but many of their voters are very skeptical about entitlement reform the democrats, on the other hand, have a very effective message about tax fairness. Whether or not that's a substantively idea is another matter. It resonates with our bases are whereas don't have a message on spending that resonates with their base. That's a big challenge for republicans going forward. 
>> Marchia the challenge for democrat now is that the tax conversation is off the table. Now when republicans say, hey, we've got a deal with spending, we've got a spending problem, not a revenue problem. We've got the revenue situation worked out. Now what do democrats do when republicans say what are you going to do about spending? 
>> Well week go back and talk about what the has already offered in spending cuts. He has never walked away from a grand bargain the way john boehner has done three times. I can bet you today, ali, republicans have kicking themselves for not taking the deal that was on the table a year and a half ago where the president offered $3 in spending cuts for of dollar of revenue. They're not in the position for republicans to being demanding that now. Democrats will make the tough decisions. President obama have said that. They understand that spending cuts do need to happen and reducing the debt and deficit is absolutely a priority for them as well as for their voters, but I think they're in a very strong position going into that to do it in a way that is fair, balanced, and in a way where the most vulnerable americans will be the ones that will be hurt the most. 

[00:10:58]


>> For those of you who just joined us, the house has passed the bill, the final tally is 257 in favor, 167 against. Markets around the world are reacting to this. The major markets that are open are australia and south korea. Australia is up about 1.9%. South korea about 1.4%. That might be a harbinger about what they're going to see. They're tallying up and doing procedural stuff. We're waiting for president obama in about the next nine minutes or so to come out and make a statement. John, we're sort of nowhere further than we were and we have three major things in front of us. Number one, we hit the debt CEILING ON DECEMBER 31st, WHICH Means they've got maybe a month before we have another debt ceiling debacle. The problem with the debt ceiling is it's not nearly as influential as this is but i could shut the government down. 
>> That's correct. As absurd as this sounds, the real difficult situation will come down the line. As you know, there's no rational reason to expect that this next congress is going to be any more competent or pro active than the last one. So rational experience would indicate we're in for a lot of ugliness in the months ahead. 
>> They're going to be a little bit more democratic. 
>> In the senate in particular. Republicans -- when john boehner and they were negotiating in 2011, that's a deal many fiscal conservatives rationally wish they had taken at the time. 

[00:12:59]


>> Dan a, tell us more about how this vote broke down. 257 yes, 167 no but party lines crossing on both of those votes. 
>> We now have the exact numbers and it really -- republicans really did lose a majority a vast majority of their own. 151 republicans voted against, 85 only voted for. On the democratic side, this to me is also fascinating. 172 democrats, only 16 voted no. There are 70 members of the progressive caucus, those are the most liberal members, many of who I think were really unhappy with the the way this deal went down given the tax cut tlold old went up from 250 to 450. It seems that the president did a pretty good job today when he gave his presentation to house democrats, convincing them that this is a good deal. DeEND OF THE DAY, THIS SET THE Tone for the day. 
>> Still to come, more on the fiscal cliff decision. President obama is set to speak on the outcome at about 20 after. We'll talk about who wins and who loses in this deal.

>>> Breaking news, the president momes away from speaking about the fiscal cliff deal that has now passed the house of representatives, about to become law. Let's go to the chief white house correspondent, jessica yellin. What's going on at the white house? 
>> Reporter: Hi, ali. President obama is going to be out here in the briefing room to make a statement within the next five minutes. He's scheduled to speak. I expect that he will congratulate congress for getting this over the finish line and at least acknowledge -- tell americans that their taxes for the most part will not be going up. And then pitch immediately forward to the next battles that washington will be facing and urge everybody in washington to tackle them in a more expeditious manner. I would like to tell you already senate minority leader mitch McCONNELL, THE CHIEF REPUBLICAN In the senate who negotiated this final deal with the white house has already sent over a statement engaging the white house on this issue. They sent this one to the press saying -- looking ahead to the next battle. McCONNELL SAYS NOW IT IS TIME TO Get serioducing america's out of control spending. It's a debate the people want, the debate we'll have next and a debate the republicans are ready for. So the gauntlet has been thrown down. 

[00:18:40]


>> Talk to me about the role that joe biden played here. He appeared to be brought in late in the game. I'm curious why for the first 517 games he wasn't brought in if he was so effective getting a DEAL DONE with McConnell. 
>> Usually these measures have to start in the house of representatives because they're tax-and-spending measures. You'd have to work with speaker boehner. The president was trying to work out this grand bargain with speaker boehner. But when they couldn't get it done and it collapsed, it pitched over to the senate. When it became clear it had to be a senate deal, mitch McCONNELL HAS THIS HISTORIC Relationship with the vice president because they worked in the senate for so many years together. They just know each other. It's not like they're great friends and they don't go around and vacation together but they know how to get deals done together. So when he needed what they call a dance partner, knew what they needed to horse trade and make it happen, that's who he turned to. He's just become an exceptional resource in the white house for getting deals done on capitol hill. 
>> We've got an eye on that door as well. You're looking at the same thing to make sure if the president comes out, we're all going to stop talking. For the next three big things happening, the dealt ceiling, the sequester, which this bill pushes off for two months, the massive spending cuts and then for a budget, which we don't even really talk about these days but we actually have to have budgets done in this country, are we going to see a bigger role for joe biden in all of these things now? 
>> Well, he was essential in the debt talks to begin with. So potentially yes and -- oh, he's here. 
>> All right. 
>>> Happy new year, everybody. 
>> Happy new year. 
>> A central premise of my campaign for president was to change the tax code that was too skewed towards the wealthy at the expense of working, middle class americans. Tonight we've done that thanks to the votes of democrats and republicans in congress. I will sign a law that raises taxes on the wealthiest 2% of americans while preventing a middle class tax hike that could have sent the economy back into recession and obviously had a severe impact on families all across america. I want to thank all the leaders of the house and senate. In particular I want to thank the work that was done by my extraordinary vice president, joe biden, as well as leader harry reid, speaker boehner, nancy pelosi and mitch McCONNELL. Everyone worked really hard and once again, joe, I want to thank you for your great work. Under this law more than 98 % of americans and 97% of small businesses will not see their income taxes go up. Millions of families will continue to receive tax credits to help raise their kids and send them to college. Companies will continue to receive tax credits for the research they do, the investments they make and the clean energy jobs they create. And 2 million americans who are out of work but out there looking pounding the pavement every day are going to continue to receive unemployment benefits as long as they're actively looking for a job. But I think we all recognize this law is just one step in the broader effort to strengthen our economy and broaden opportunity for everybody. The fact is the deficit is still too high. And we're still investing too little in the things that we need for the economy to grow as fast as it should. And that's why speaker boehner and I originally tried to negotiate a larger agreement that would put this country on a path that paying down its debt while also putting americans back to work, rebuilding our roads andbridges and providing investments in areas like education and job training. Unfortunately there just wasn't enough support or time for that kind of large agreement in a lame duck session of congress. And that failure comes with a cost, as the messy nature of the process over the past several weeks has made business more uncertain and consumers less confident. But we are continuing to chip away at this problem step by step. Last year I signed into law $1.7 trillion in deficit reduction. Tonight's agreement further reduces the deficit by raising $620 billion in revenue from the wealthiest households in! America and there will be more deficit reduction as congress decides what to do about the automatic spending cuts that we have now delayed for two months. As I've demonstrated throughout the past several weeks, I am very open to compromise. I agree with democrats and republicans that the aging population and the rising cost of health care makes medicare the biggest contributor to our deficit. I believe we've got to find ways to reform that program without hurting seniors, who couldn't on it to survive. And I believe there's further unnecessary spending in government that we can eliminate. But we can't simply cut our way to prosperity. Cutting spending has to go hand in hand with further reforms to our tax code so that the wealthiest corporations and individual can take advantage of loopholes and deductions that aren't available to most americans and we can't keep cutting things like basic research and new technology and still expect to succeed in the 21st century economy. So we're going to have to continue to move forward in deficit reduction but we have to do it in a balanced way, making sure that we are growing, even as we get a handle on our spending. Now, one last point I want to make. While I will negotiate over many things, I will not have another debate with this congress over whether or not they should pay the bills that they've already racked up through the laws that they passed. Let me repeat. We can't not pay bills that we've already incurred. If congress refuses to give the united states government the ability to pay these bills on time, the consequences for the entire global economy would be catastrophic, far worse than the impact of a fiscal cliff. People will remember back in 2011 the last time this course of action was threatened, our entire recovery was put at risk. Consumer confidence plunged, business investment plunged, growth dropped. We can't go down that path again. And today's agreement enshrines, I think, a principle into law that will remain in place as long as I am president. The deficit needs to be reduced in way that's balanced. Everyone pays their fair share. Everyone does their part. That's how our economy works best. That's hough we grow. The sum total of all the budget agreements we've reached so far proves that there is a path forward that, it isossible if we focus not on our politics but what's -- but on what's right for the country. And the one thing that iink hopefully in the new year we'll focus on is seeing if we can put a package like this together with a little bit less drama, a little bit less brinksmanship, not scare the heck out of folks quite as much. We can come together as democrats and republicans to cut spending and raise revenue in a way that reduces our deficit, protects the middle class and provides ladders into the middle class for everybody who is willing to work hard. We can set this will debate or at the very least into the allow it to be so all consuming all the time that it stops us from meeting a host of other challenges that we face, creating jobs, boosting incomes, fixing our infrastructure, fixing our immigration system, protecting our planet from the harmful effects of climate change, boosting domestic energy production, protecting our kids from the horrors of gun violence. It's not just possible to do these things, it's an obligation to ourselves and to future generations, and I look forward to working with every single member of congress to meet this obligation in the new year. And I hope that everybody now gets at least a day off, i guess, or a few days off so that people can refresh themselves because we're going to have a lot of work to do in 2013.

>> There you have it. President obama and jay carney and the vice president leaving the briefing room there where he just said he is not going to get -- this is interesting. Let me bring our political panel, we'll have the conversation with them. Maria, the president saying I'm not getting into a fight with congress about paying for the bills that we've already run up. That's is a direct reference to the debt ceiling that was hit yesterday. He's saying he's not going to have a debate. Here's my problem with that. He shouldn't have to. The debt ceiling is a stupid technical thing that only exists in america and the law really has to be changed. It's as simple as that. People think this is very simplistic, you should have a credit card limit. In other countries, you pay for a law as you make that law. It's a silly tng. But for the president to say he's not going to have a debate about it, he is going to have a debate about it. Apparently we debate about everything. 
>> If the president says it's a certain day, republicans are sure to say that it's not that day. Look, yes, there will be a debate. I think what he was talking about, though, ali is we're not going to get to the brinksmanship and I think he hopes and all americans hope we don't get to the point where we were the last time we had the silly debate on the debt where our country was downgraded and we did look foolish in the eyes of the world. You know, the market was down and it just certainly was not good for our economy. And I think those are the points that the president was making. We don't need to get there. Now, in terms of having a debate on the broader issues, for example, if they start now the way that he has asked in terms of having a discussion about reform, about tax reform, about spending cuts and doing it in a responsible way that doesn't hurt our growth and doesn't hurt our economy or job creation, then he is absolutely willing and democrats are and clearly republicans want this, too, to have that kind of conversation. But I think what he is saying he is not going to do is to let republicans, the way that they tried to do last time, hold the debt limit talk hostage to what it is that they're going to be asking for in these broader debates. 

[00:30:01]


>> For those of us just joining us, let's me bring you up to speed on what's going on. The president just spoke about the fiscal cliff deal that was just passed within the last hour by the house of representatives. History today on the floor of the the house, a vote in favor of a deal to avert the fiscal cliff, after a very, very long day of will they or won't they? Late tonight house leadership finally decided to bring the bill to the floor for what is a so-called up-or-down vote. Either you vote for it or against it. It passed largely on partisan lines. But far more democrats voting in favor than republicans. Only 85 republicans voted in favor of the bill. One man responsible for wrangling republican votes in the house is the deputy whip, congressman tom cole. I don't know if you'll appreciate it if I say congratulations to you. 
>> It's been a difficult few weeks the house worked its will tonight. I'm pleased to make 85% of the bush tax cuts permanent for 98% of the american people, to get rid of the alternative minimum tax once and for all. There's a lot of good thgs in this bill and the president is going to have to be a lot more for the coming than he has been on spending cuts and entitlement reform going forward. We'll have that opportunity when we deal with sequestration and when the debt ceiling comes up again. 
>> You're a member of the house leadership. You're all important, all members of congress but you're a member of the leadership. How will you do things differently going forward with the debt ceiling debate, the sequester debate? 
>> I disagree with some of your earlier callers. We didn't have a downgrade because of the debt ceiling debate. We had it because we weren't dealing with our deficit. 
>> That's not entirely true -- 

[00:32:04]


>> that is entirely true -- 
>> it is actually isn't. I enjoy talking to you but it's not true. 
>> You can't have trillion dollar -- 
>> give me five minutes and I'll pull out s&p reports. I don't know as much about congress as you do but I do know about this. 
>> I can assure you when you're spending that much more than you're taking in, that's the cause of the problem and we have no creditable plan. The president, have I a lot of respect for him pip worked with him on this and worked with him tonight and I'm proud to do so. When you get a vote up here, when you have a democratic senate that can't produce a budget in three years. 
>> Listen, I don't think the president is blameless and i don't think democrats are blameless but you have a specific job, just like the president has a specific job. You are a member of the republican leadership. Most people if you landed from mars ten days ago and looked at this, your general take away with be these republicans in the house don't know how to get it together, they have lack of discipline, doesn't have a consistent message, they leave things to the last moment. How do republicans in the mouse get it together? 
>> I don't think we do leave things to th last minute. We dealt with thesequester and tax cuts in may. The senate didn't ever pick them up and deal with those things and offer a counterproposal. Quite frankly the president talks a good game about entitlement reform and deficit reduction, we just haven't seen it in four years. He's the one that appointed bowles-simpson and didn't endorse any of its recommendations. 
>> As I recall there was a key member of the republican conference who voted against it. Do you recall who I'm talking abou 
>> sure, I certainly do. 
>> It was paul ryan, the man who ran for vice president of the united states. He voted against bowles-simpson. 

[00:34:07]


>> Look, it's the president's commission. 
>> You can't blame the president for everything. Does paul ryan not take responsibility for that? 
>> Paul ryan voted with us tonight. So I think paul ryan has made aordinary contributions, but we have to have a plan from the president that gets democratic votes. Again, this is a budget that he's presented -- 
>> what about -- 
>> a couple of years with no democratic votes. How can that be a serious plan? 
>> Totally with you. I said this an hour ago, the one thing the government has a responsibility to do is come up with a budget. Eric cantor voted against this bill. You have a discipline problem in the republican house caucus. 
>> We let the house -- look, this was an unusual circumstance. I disagree with a lot of my friends. I look at something that makes 85% of the bush tax cuts permanent for 98% of the american people as a big win. Frankly, when taxes were going to go up oneverybody, to not protect 98% of the people when you had an opportunity to me is short sighted. If we don't pass this tonight, you're looking at a $4 trillion tax increase and you're looking at financial chaos. You're also looking at a gutted military. I think this was the right step tonight. But we're going to have to have a lot more in terms of democratic participation in dealing with entitlements. Hopefully that will come. 
>> You said something very interesting several weeks ago when you first suggested why don't weep get this out of the way, this tax debate because it's sucking out all the air out of the room and then you take away the cover republicans have to discuss -- 
>> the democrats have. 
>> I'm sorry, your quote, u're right. I'm quoting you. That's an interesting idea. Do you feel we're making progress here? Now that we've taken that off the table and you can force the democrats? 
>> I do. Look, I'm not saying all revenue questions have been settled for all time but most have been settled for the immediate future tonight. So now it's a matter of spending cut and entitlement reforms. We need to see those on the table. I also said, look, there's an area the president can lead in and this entitlement th only -- entitlement reform is where the money is at. It lab lot of tougher votes ahead of us if we're really going to deal with the fiscal problem. 

[00:36:36]


>> Thank up for your contribution to getting this done. Tom kole of oklahoma. Look forward to speaking to you on the other matters. Let's go to jessica yellin at the white house. What's going on over there? 
>> I can hear the helicopter landing on the lawn. The latest news is the president is taking off to get on air force i. He broke off his vacation here to get this done. The president, you heard him address his accomplishments, what he thinks were the single achievements in this legislation and then you were talking to the panel there a little bit about how it could be he could possibly avoid having a fight over the debt ceiling. I would venture to say that it's possible what he's signaling. Perhaps he's willing to let the nation default, that he could allow that to happen. We should keep in mind the blicans are the party that HAS MORE BUSINESS, CEOs AND IN Their corner as donors, sponsors and backers. And perhaps would get even more pressure from that community were republicans to try to lean in that direction and perhaps that is what the president is trying to signal by saying repeatedly he is prepared to let them walk the plank and will not have that fight. 
>> He didn'dge on that. He said "i won't have another debate with congress on whether they should pay the bills." 
>> He's given a few speeches on this that have been even more elaborated further and has been quite clear that this is not a fight he's willing to have. So I think he has something in mind when it comes to this issue. 
>> You look back to the election, look how the president has played this since then. What's your initial evaluation of how they've handled this? 

[00:38:44]


>> I think that there is a -- they didn't get everything they could have gotten and the president once again wasn't able to close the deal. This is not his greatest skill, negotiating. It's quite evident. He's lucky to have biden in the white house and such a skilled negotiators, somebody who has a great relationship on the hill. He did get what he needed, he did get some of the other items. But once again, he is a democratic president having a discussion about debt, deficits, these are issues that are paramount to the republican party and but he's having it on republican language or an interesting road for him to navigate for the next four years, ali. 
>> Jessica, thank you for your coverage on this story. 
>> As you know, this battle didn't end with tonight's votes. We'll tell you a little bit more about it when we come back. You're watching "outfront." ...so as you can see, GEICO's customer satisfaction is at 97%. Mmmm tasty. And cut! Very good. People are always asking me how we make these GEICO adverts.

>>> Congressman charlie rangel is on the floor of the house of representatives right now. You'd think the whole place would be shut down and everybody would be going home. There are in fact some issues going on, particularly with members of the new york delegation to the house of representatives. Let's go to our senior congressional correspondent dana bash. Rangel just left the podium. What's going on with new york? 
>> Reporter: It appears that the house is going to leave without passing the $60 billion in assistance that the senate passed for victims of hurricane sandy. That's why you're seeing -- there you see republican from pennsylvania, likely his district was hit, but mostly new york and new jersey members, republicans and democrats going one after the other to the house floor really angry about this. Doesn't necessarily mean they ultimately won't get the federal dollars but what it does mean is on thursday a new congress is sworn in. So the whole process of having to get this money through the system, through the senate and the house will have to start all over again. This appears to be a pretty direct casualty of this fiscal cliff deal. The reason is because we've been talking all night about republicans being angry about not enough spending cuts. This would have been $60 billion in new spending without any offsets. Of course it would be emergency sing but new spending that republicans clearly could not stomach passing. This information comes from the appropriations chairman hal rogers to our dierdre walsh. The republican governor from new jersey was here and other republicans from that area really pressing members of congress saying we need this money because, as you well know, you're up in new york, so many people are in dire straits after that had your canadian. 
>> That's an unusual casualty of not getting that money because congress is tired of giving money. When we come back, an update on hillary clinton. flo? is? Are you flo? Yes. Is this the thing you gave my husband? Well, yeah, yes. The "name your price" tool. You tell us the price you want to pay, and we give you a range of options to choose from.

>>> a potentially dangerous blood clot has forced sretary of state hillary clinton to spend another night in a new york city hospital. Toght doctors are treatinger with blood thinners. The clot was found during a follow-up mri after the secretary of state suffered a concussion last month. Doctors say the clot is located between the brai and the skull behind mrs. Clinton's right ear. Dr. David daeton is the chief of vascular surgery at georgetown hospital. This situation that she is in right now doctors are describing as fully curable. 
>> Yes, I think that's right, ali. She has a clot as desibed in the transverse signus behind her right ear. This is similar to other clots in the venus system treated with anti-coagulants offered referred to as blood thinners and should resolve spontaneously on that therapy. 
>> It is unusual it taking this long to treat it, going on the third night in the hospital? 
>> Usually it's related to regulating the medicine. The clot will resolve over many more days. It takes weeks. Often anti-coagulant therapy is given for three to six months and often life long. 
>> Heparin, coumadin, those are the names we're talking about? 
>> Yes, those are the two most common. 
>> They say there's no stroke as a result of this, but this is the kind of thing that can cause a stroke? 
>> In some cases it is associated with stroke but all the information we have now is that she had a scan and this was discovered on an imaging study and she didn't have any clinical symptoms. In a large number of cases, as with blood clots in the veins and other parts of the body, it's not associated with anything other than the finding of the clot on an imaging study. 

[00:51:07]


>> So for the rest of us, how do we know we're not walking around with something like this? 
>> Well, as you might imagine, sometimes we do have undiscovered medical conditions and it's basically clinical symptom toll ji that leads us to investigate these problems. If it's so small as to not cause any clinical symptoms, these things the body resolves on its own without our ever knowing about it. 
>> One last thing. How long do you think her recovery period is? She's a busy woman. I know she's coming to the end of her tenure but she keeps pretty busy. Is she going to have to keep off that kind of a schedule? 
>> I think that will be dictated by her concussion rather than the blood clot. The blood clot in and of itself doesn't restrict her activity in any way as long as her medication is dosed appropriately and under control. 
>> Thank you for your help and helping our viewers understand this. 
>> Showing you pictures, that's marine I carrying president obama to andrews air force base. He's scheduled to take off on air force I to honolulu, hawaii to join his family. He interrupted his vacation to return to deal with the fiscal cliff. The president didn't waste any time. After that house vote took place, he and joe biden made a statement and he is on his way to hawaii. We'll be right back. I tuned it all out. With UnitedHealthcare, I get information that matters..

Dr. Dyer: You are living and feeling as if your future dreams are a present fact. Thank you. Thank you, wow. Ooh. Thank you so much. Thank you. Thank you very much, appreciate it. God bless you. I appreciate it so much. Oh, thank you, thank you. I am Wayne Dyer, and I am well. 
[Applause] In fact, I am perfect health, and, by the time this program is over, you'll have a much clearer understanding of what those words really mean. It's just great to be back on Public Television. I've been doing Public Television pledge shows since 1998. My children were raised, I have eight of them, and they were raised on Public Television, little Barney things were all over my house for so many years. And of course, I think of Public Television as one of the great energy systems coming into our homes and I'm proud to be a part of it, to support it, and to help raise money for it. It's our national treasure, and I'd hate to think of what would ever happen if we lost it. This show is called Wishes Fulfilled. It's based on a book that I have just completed. I spent the last year or so in writing it, researching it, living it, practicing it, and have come to a place in my heart where I know that it's really not so much about what you want in terms of what you manifest, it's who you are. You manifest what you become as a human being, and this program is about teaching you to become the highest-consciousne that you can be, to be aligned with your source, to be alned with God. And when you are, you become a creator and a co-creator in your life. I'd like to open this program with a poetic offering from Samuel Taylor Coleridge, who wrote the Rime of the Ancient Mariner, and he also wrote a poem that I used earlier in my life, in one of my ear books, Real Magic. Listen to the words and ask yourself if, if they really, if they really mean something to be true for you, if you really believe in what the poet is offering here. He says, what if you slept and what if, in your sleep, you dreamed, and what if in your dream, you went to heaven, and there picked a strange and wonderful flower. And what if, when you awoke, you held that flower in your hand. Ah, what then, the poet asks. Do you believe that it's possible to bring something from the world of the formless, from the world of a dream, into the world of the physical. The poet was speaking metaphorically, but I am not. This is really a program about applying those words in your own reality. Most of us were raised to become ordinary, and I'm not putting down ordinary, but ordinary is just not good enough for me. Ordinary is you go through your life and you fill out the forms, and you pay your taxes, and you do what your rents tell you, and you're honorable, and you're honest, and you're a good citizen, and then you die. Extraordinary is something very, very different. This is about recognizing within yourself that there's something very, very extraordinary that you haven't been trained to believe in, to come to a place where you can apply it and put it into your life. And I want to say to you that I have been working in my life at living an extraordinary life, and so many powerful things have happened to me I'll be sharing with you throughout this program. But more than that, you can go way beyond ordinary. You can go way beyond just being average. There's not an average person watching this show. There's not an average person in this room tonight. All of us are extraordinary. We just have to come to believe it. There was a friend of mine, her name was Portia Nelson. Portia passed away a few years back. She lived up in Seattle. And she was at a seminar and they ask her to, and they ask everyone, to write on a five-by-seven sheet of paper or card the five chapters of their life. They only wanted to give them five-by-seven cards because they didn't want them to get too wordy. And Portia Nelson sat down and wrote theseords about the five chapters of her life, and I thought I would share them here with you. They're so beautiful. She said, chapter one of my life, I walked down the street. There's a deep hole in the sidewalk. I fall in. I'm lost. I'm helpless. It isn't my fault, and it takes forever to find a way out. Chapter two of my life, I walk down the same street. There's a deep hole in the sidewalk. I pretend I don't see it. I fall in again. I can't believe I'm in the same place. It isn't my fault, and it still takes a long time to get out. Chapter three of my life, I walk down the same street. There's a deep hole in the sidewalk. I see it there. I still fall in. It's a habit. My eyes are open. I know where I am. It's my own fault, and I get out immediately. Chapter four of my life, I walk down the same street. There's a deep hole in the sidewalk. I walk around it. Chapter five of my life, I walk down another street. Isn't that great? Portia Nelson. I walk down another street. And this is another street. Look, it's called New Street, Old Street. Walking down another street means leaving behind ordinary, and when I use the word ordinary, it has deep and profound meanings to me. Ordinary just simply isn't enough. Ordinary is when you want to become average and to fit in. But to get to extraordinary, what you do is you have to consult the invisible place within yourself, and this is called your soul. And your soul, well, I jotted down a few words about the soul, based on a lecture I heard from a great teacher of mine who lived in Bulgaria. He was an initiatic science teacher, and his lecture was very profound, and I wrote these words after listening to one of his recorded lectures. He said, the ideal of the soul, the thing it asks for is neither knowledge nor light, nor happiness. The ideal of the soul is space, immensity. The one thing your soul needs isbe free, free to expand and reach out and to embrace the infinite. Yes, the ideal of the soul is infinity. It is miserable when it is circumscribed and restricted. It is a fragment of the universal soul, which is infinite. That's what I speak about here in this program. The need to move beyond just fitting in, the need to move past being circumscribed, the soul does not like when you get fenced in, when it is told what to do, when it's told it has limitations, when it's told it can't becthat. And so many of us go through our life with these enormous limitations that we've placed upon ourselves that have been handed to us from the time that we were litle boys and little girls. If you look on the screen, you'll see something that is very important and powerful to me. I was swimming not too long ago up in Minneapolis. I went to see my daughter, Tracy. And up and down I would swim the pool, and every time I would look up, I would see this written on the wall, and I thought, as I was preparing to do this program, this is just so important andnificant. If you would like to accomplish something, you must first expect it of yourself. And my question to you is, what do you expect of yourself? Do you expect to be able to perform miracles, to attract into your life the kind of prosperity that you are entitled to? Do you expect that you can manifest the kind of relationships that you would like? In order to be able to have these kinds of expectations for yourself, you have to make a dramatic change, a dramatic shift. You must change what's possible for you and what you believe is possible for you, but the question becomes, who am I? Here, I've been teaching philosophy for 40 years now, either at the high school level, or junior high school level, or university level, graduate school, and now on stages all over the world and in front of audiences such as this watching at home and here this evening. Who are you? And what is real? My teacher in India, his name was Nisargadatta Maharaj. He was asked the question, Swami, what is real, Master, what is real? And his response was, that is real which never changes. So, what part of you is real by that definition? Who are you that never changes? So many of us believe that we are our bodies. I don't know about you, but this body that I'm in right now is changing all the time, very fast, as a matter of fact. In fact, I, Wayne Dyer, the I that is I, have been in many, many bodies since I incarnated for this first time here on this planet, right here, 71 years ago. So, I was in a, oh, my goodness, look here. What happened to that body? And there it is, there's another body that I was in, and there's another body. I am on the right, another body. And then I was in, look at that haircut. They did it with garden shears in those days but I lived in foster homes. There I am, look at that hair. Can you believe that? Is that, is that possible? And then I was in this body, and then I was in this body. And I have been in toddler bodies, baby bodies, teenaged bodies, macho bodies. Moustache bodies. Endless bodies I have been in with my little ones and my eight children. And the fact of it is that, hen you think about it, when I was in the 20-year-old body that I was in, I really thought it was real. Didn't you? I mean, even the body that you're in, all of you look at your body and think, well, let's see, I was in a 20-year-old body, and is it real, was it real? Well, you believed that it was real, but I've been looking for that 20-year-old body for 50 years now. I can't find it. And the fact of it is, the body that you're in right now is not who you are, because it doesn't meet that fundamental definition of what is real. What is real is what never changes. The fact is that who you are keeps occupying new bodies every single moment that you are here on this planet. There was a great poet, her name was Emily Dickinson. I feel like she was, must have been a sister, a soul mate of mine. She once had a poem, she said, holding up a handful of dust, she would reach down and say, this quiet dust was gentlemen and ladies, and lads and girls, was laughter and ability, and sighing and frocks and curls. This passive place, a summer's nimble mansion where bloom and bees fulfilled their Oriental circuit, then ceased like these. That's who all of us are if we identify ourselves with our body. The fact is that everything in this physical universe doesn't meet the definition of what is real. Who you are is that soul that I spoke about a few moments ago, that soul that says, I want to expand, I want to be free, I want to go to a place where I understand that who I am is birthless, deathless, changeless, and live from that place, because what this involves fundamentally is reprogramming yourself from the belief system that has been your ego, the part of us that has comeo believe that who we are is what we have, and who we are is what we do, and who we are is what other people think of us, like our reputation, and who we are is separate from each other, and most egregiously, who we are is separate from God, from our source. And so we've been raised and taken out into the world and said, go out there and prove who you are by achieving, by accumulating, by getting other people to like you. I wrote a book and did a film not too long ago called The Shift, and one of the. Thank you. And in there, I spoke about and used these words. The direction we take in life is far more important than the place that our ego parks us in this present moment, that who we are is this divine infinite being that keeps occupying new bodies, endlessly, until we leave this body and then move on, and there is no beginning, there is no end, there is only now, each and every one of us. So the soul, the part of you that is extraordinary, the part of you that came into this world and knows, I can be anything, I can do anything, I can accomplish anything that I place my attention on, because if you want to accomplish something, you must first just expect it of yourself, and this means changing around the expectations that you've been conditioned to believe are your dharma, or are your destiny, I am limited, I am not entitled to prosperity, I am unable to deal wit physical ailments, I need something else, I need to take pills in order to do it, I need to have somebody else do it for me, that within eand every one of us there is this marvelous knowing that is really and truly God ourselves, each and every one of us.

BaBette Davidson: Oh I am so glad to have Wayne Dyer back on PBS. Hello, I'm BaBette Davidson and I am so delighted to be with you and sharing this great program and so grateful to have America's most insightful, spiritual person Wayne Dyer. Thank you for being here again. 
Wayne Dyer: Thank you, it's nice to be back. You look so beautiful. 
BaBette Davidson: Oh thank you. I am just so thrilled with this new program. 
Wayne Dyer: Oh thank you, I am too. 
BaBette Davidson: It's very exciting, and I always feel like I need this little intensive Wayne shot in the arm to kind of keep me on track. 
Wayne Dyer: Thank you, I'm very proud of it. It's something that I spent the last couple of years of my life of being involved in, and I think we got a lot of really, really great things for people to hear. So stay tuned. 
BaBette Davidson: Absolutely. So we hope that you're going to the phone right now to say thank you to this PBS station for bringing you Dr. Wayne Dyer, and these beautiful ideas. One of the things that you said in that was that ordinary is not good enough. 
Wayne Dyer: Right. 
BaBette Davidson: And there is nothing ordinary about you or PBS or these wonderful thank you gifts that you put together. I have shared all the materials in the past with my family and myself, and you really come up with some wonderful things this time. 
Wayne Dyer: We absolutely have. We're calling it the b banana. Because I have a place on Maui and we sort of have a Hawaii connection here. So the big banana is a whole collection of wonderful gifts that we're going to be sharing with you and telling you much more about. 
BaBette Davidson: Oh that's great. Now one of the things that you said when you went out, the very first thing that you said is, "I am well." And I can tell you that, I could feel the emotion in the theatre, I felt it when you said it, those that follow you and read about you, you've had some health challenges this year. 
Wayne Dyer: I have. I had a diagnosis of leukemia a couple of years ago, and I kind of bought into it and was told there were certain restrictions I had to place on my life, and I listened to that. And then I had some miraculous things happen. I had a healing take place with a man named John of God down in Brazil. I looked within myself and decided that I am not this body. And my body is going to go through whatever motions, I'm going to feed it as well as I possibly can. And inside here, I am well, I am perfect health, and actually, I'm living in a higher level and more energetic level than I've ever lived at in my entire life. So I am well. 

[00:21:27]


BaBette Davidson: You are well. I am grateful. So there you go. 
Wayne Dyer: Thank you. 
BaBette Davidson: Now something else that is new, in addition to those new kid pictures of you, those are adorable! 
Wayne Dyer: Wasn't I was a cute little kid, did you see all that hair? Did you see that? I have a little, my Brillo cream. 
BaBette Davidson: There was a little bit of hair going on there. Speaking of the top of your head, I love the hat, that's new. 
Wayne Dyer: I did, well, I picked this up at the place, one of the things we're talking about a little bit later on in the big banana, is experiencing the miraculous. I took a group of people to Lourdes and to Assisi and Medjugorje and down the streets of Lourdes where these great miracles took place back in the 1850s, they were selling these hats. I got one for each one of my children, and I haven't taken it off since. I just love it. 
BaBette Davidson: That's a wonderful gift and we so appreciate these thank you gifts because they really do make a difference. You share so much of yourself and that's what I appreciate. When I watch one of these programs I feel like I know Dr. Wayne Dyer and he is really going to help my life. And if you feel that way and you appreciate having Wayne back on this PBS station, we hope that you will go to the phone right now and make a call and let the station know that this is the type of extraordinary experience that you want on your PBS station. And of course, when you make that call, we're always very grateful. 

[00:24:54]


Dr. Dyer: Thank you. Thank you so much. You're very kind. You're very kind. Over the years, I've written many books, 37 of them to be exact. This, what has come to become really clear to me in the last few years of my life is that there really are, there really are two selves within each and every one of us. Muktananda called the ego, the part of us that has edged God out, e-g-o, edged God out, the false self. And the false self is this part of us that is not authentic. It is, it is the ego. This false self is the part of us that is always trying to, trying to win, trying to own things, trying to prove itself. We send our kids off to school and we tell them, you know, be ahead of everybody else, win no matter what, and so on. And they have aendency just to believe that who they are, are these bodies, even though the body they're in is going to change, and you'll never be able to find it again. And then there's within each and every one of us a higher self. And this higher self is, is really the soul, it's really the spirit, it's really, it's really God. But these two selves are sort of constantly at, they're not at war so much with each other, but there's a, there's this battleground that we have within us. I'll give you an example of it in my own life. Somebody on the Internet, a guy named Watkins, has put out a list, because there's lists for everything, the 100 Most Spiritually Influential People Alive, and they put out this list, a hundred people. And they rank from number one to 100. And I'm on the list. I'm one of the. Yeah, thank you. Not only am I on the list, but I am, according to this list, and they've got all this criteria on how you get on this list, I am the third most spiritually influential person alive. How about that, huh? So the spiritual part of myself, my soul, the higher place within myself, says to me, this is not relevant. You're not any better than anybody else, just because somebody has put you on a list. In fact, you shouldn't even be, you shouldn't even know about that list. And perhaps the people who are most spiritually influential aren't even on that list and don't even want to be on the list, because they don't care about those kind of rankings and comparisons and so on. But then there's the ego over here that says, what do you mean, er three? Well, what's going on with that? And who are these people who are more spiritually influential than you? And how are you going to take them down? So there's this sort of constant thing about, it shouldn't make any difference, who I am is, you know, is the same as everyone else, we all come from the same place, and we all return back to the same place, but then the ego says, let's see, the two people ahead of me on this list, one of them is Eckhart Tolle but he had Oprah. And she's only number eight on the list anyway, so. And he got on there every week, and that's not fair, so and then there's the Dalai Lama and I figure Eckhart and I maybe can get together and take the Dalai Lama out of this thing. Or maybe I should align with the Dalai Lama, and anyway. The ego is doing this, this number on us. But there's also the part of us that is divine. And this is the place that I'm addressing here in this program. There's a quote from Joel Goldsmith. Joel wrote so many great books. A Parenthesis in Eternity was one of them. And this is what Joel said. He said, then there are those who reach a stage in which they realize the futility of this constant striving and struggling for the things that perish, things which, after they are obtained, prove to be shadows. It is at this stage that some persons turn fis seeking for things in the outer realm to a seeking for them from God. And that's who you tuned into today, on this program. I have left this pursuing things, and money, and fame, and winning, and being better than others. It's taken me awhile, but it has been, it has been a powerful journey. As a matter of fact, I had said to my ex-wife, I said, can you imagine, did you ever in your wildest dreams, could you ever have imagined that you would be married to the third most spiritually influential person alive? And she said, I just, she said, they didn't call me when they made that list. And she said also, she said, I don't want to upset you, dear, but you're not in my wildest dreams. Yeah, all right. So moving to this higher place is, is really understanding that in, in the second chapter of Wishes Fulfilled, I call it the higher self, and it gets defined very specifically by this great Bulgarian teacher, his name was Omraam Mikhael Aivanhov. And he's, he was teaching what's called the initiatic sciences, and I have had his teachings show up in my life in a very powerful way. I've studied his writing. I've listened to many of his recorded lectures that took place back in the '50s and '60s and '70s and, and I brought a quote of his that I'd like to share with you. Our higher self is perfect, omniscient and almighty, a fragment of God himself, a pure, transparent, luminous quintessence. I love that. I love great writing like that. And that, within each and every one of us, there is a place inside of each and every one of us that is all knowing, that is almighty, that is actually a fragment of God. He then went on to say, the creator has planted within every creature a fragment of himself, a spark, spirit of the same nature of himself. And thanks to this spirit, every creature can become a creator. And this means that instead of always waiting for their needs to be satisfied by some external source, human beings can absolutely look inwardly by means of their own thoughts, their own will, and their own spirit, to obtain nourishing, healing elements that they need. This is why he said to all of us, the teaching I bring to you is of the spirit, of the creator, and not of matter, a spark, a spark that is in each and every one of us. And this spark I want you to be able to recognize, because that spark, I'd lio see you have it grow from just a tiny little spark, which means you can hardly see it, to a fragment, to a piece, to a larger chunk, if you will, to a section, so that this spark within you, that you see up here, is growing and growing and growing, until it absolutely becomes even more than you imagined. T. S. Eliot, the great American poet, said, we shall not cease from exploration, but at the end of all of our exploring will be to return to the place from which we originated, but to know it for the first time. I paraphrased that, it's off a little. To know it for the first time. I think that T. S. Eliot might have been speaking about death, but I'm not. I think that we can come to know this place from which we originated, the place to which we return, all of us, by allowing this spark to become something bigger than just an occasional thing where you extend an act of kindness someplace, or you have it at the church, or at the mosque, or at the synagogue on a holy day or a holy observance, that it can become your way of being. There was a grfat teacher in India, his name was Vivekananda. Vivekananda came to the West as a young teacher, a very profound teacher, and he was asked the question, but how do you do this? How do you, how do you access this higher self? How do you make this your reality? And he said these words to his devotees, and I say them to you. He said, in the springtime, go out and observe the blossoms on the fruit trees. He said, the blossoms vanish of themselves as the fruit grows, and so, too, will the lower self, the false self, the ego, vanish as the divine grows within you. It's about allowing yourself to recognize you must have this spark, because this is what you came from, and this is what you'll return to. And as this spark becomes a fragment and becomes a section, and becomes larger and larger, you reach what I call, in Wishes Fulfilled, the third chapter, the highest self. And what is the highest self? This is the one that's going to surprise you a bit. The highest self is the self that you haven't been trained to believe in. You've been trained to believe in your ordinary awareness. Your highest self is where you begin to recognize your connection to your source, to the Tao, to the divine, to God. There were three very important teachings that came to me before I put this program together and before I wrote Wishes Fulfilled. The first was a, a book by a man named U. S. Andersen, U. S. Andersen, passed away in 1986, a very profound teacher. And he wrote a book called Three Magic Words, which I have had people tell me you must read. So it's, it's fairly heavy reading but the kind of reading that I love. And there's 12 chapters in the book, and you get to the 12th chapter, and you keep waiting for the three magic words because he doesn't say what they are. And at the end of each chapter, there's a meditation. And in this meditation, you practice and put into the awareness within yourself of recognizing the highest place within yourself. And ultimately, at the very end, he said these words, Chapter 12, the very end of it. It's called The Veil Removed. This is the ineffable secret, the ultimate illumination, the key to peace and power. You are God. Those are the three magic words. If you will accept this towering truth, and dare to stand atop this magnificent pinnacle, universal consciousness will be revealed to you from within. God is there. It is he who peers from behind your eyes, who is your own consciousness, who is your very self. You are not just a part of God, you are altogether God, and God is altogether you. Now, that's scary stuff for a lot of people. We weren't raised to believe that. I'm not saying that you ought to go out into the world and say, excuse me, but, uh, you know who you're talking to, that I am God. And the reason that we laugh is because we think of God as the God that we've created in our own image, the God of the ego, the God who's angry. The God who wants special favors, the God who has the ability to heal, but withholds it. But there's another word that Jesus used in the New Testament, and this is the God I speak of, quoting him. God is love. And he that dwelleth in love, dwelleth in me, and I in him. God is love, pure, unconditional, blissful, divine love. That's who you are. The second great teaching was a man named Neville. Neville Goddard, passed away in 1972, lectured over in California, particularly in the '40s and '50s and '60s. I read his book, The Power of Awareness, seven times. I gave it to each one of my children at Christmas a couple of years ago. And they called me up and they said, Dad, it's great, but I don't ustand it, it's a little heavy. And I said, well, then maybe it's part of my dharma to make it a little clearer. And Chapter 27, the last chapter of his book, The Power of Awareness, it says this. In all of creation, in all of eternity, in all of the realms of your infinite being, the most wonderful fact is that which is stressed in the first chapter of this book, you are God. You are the I am that I am. You are consciousness. You are the creator. This is the mystery. This is the great secret known by the seers and prophets and mystics throughout the ages. This is the truth that you can never know intellectually. If you want to understand something intellectually, what you must do is analyze it, come up with a formula for it, study it, look at other experts about it, and come up to a conclusion. If you want to understand something spiritually, you must first experience it. You must come to know this within. In the New Testament, which I read completely before I wrote Wishes Fulfilled, Jesus is about to be stoned. And he says, why would you stone me? And they say, because you blaspheme, you are a man and you claim to be God. And Jesus responds, in his words, is it not written in your laws that I have said, you are Gods, all of you. We are all Gods. We have within us, not the God that so often we are taught is outside of us, but the God that is love, the God that is perfect love, the soul that wants to expand because it is infinite and doesn't want to be restricted. And I came across some great teachings that were sent to me. They showed up, as we often think they show up as accidents, but you come to realize that there are no accidents in this universe. Everything that takes place is, had the pieces moved around by something bigger than all of us. And so it was called The "I Am" Discourses. And I quote from The "I Am" Discourses. The first expression of every individual, everywhin the universe, either in spoken word, silent thought or feeling is, I am, recognizing its own conquering divinity. The student, me, you, all of us, endeavoring t understand and apply these mighty, yet simple laws, must stand guard more strictly over his thoughts and expression in words or otherwise. For every time you say, I am not, I cannot, I have not, you are, whether knowingly or unknowing throttling that great presence within you. These words, I am, I opened up this program with the words, I am well. I am perfect health. And where do you think they came from? What do these words, I am, mean? A very quick retracing of the story of Moses. Moses, this little baby, who was born at a time when the Pharaoh had ordered all male children to be drowned in the Nile, and Moses' mother took this little baby, put him in a basket and floated him down the Nile. Moses was discovered by the Pharaoh's daughter. The Pharaoh's daughter raised Moses as her own son, and the Pharaoh's grandson. But along in his late teen years, he got into a conflict and ended up seeing one of the Israelite slaves being mistreated, and he ended up killing him. So Moses had to take off, because he was afraid for his own life. And he went out into Sinai, and there married Zipporah, and had children, and was out as a shepherd. And as the Torah tells us, as it says in Exodus, he comes across a burning bush one day that is not being consumed. And the bush speaks to him. And rather than even misquote this, even a little, I brought from my hotel room. You wouldn't steal the Bible, would you, Wayne? No, I'll put it back. So the bush speaks in Exodus, Chapter 3, and says, Moses, Moses, and the first words that Moses says to God are, here I am. Then he said, do not draw near here, this place. Take off your sandals and your, for your feet, for this place where you stand is holy ground. And God speaks to Moses and says, I want you to go to the Pharaoh, and I want you to free your people. And Moses is going, well, wait, wait, hold on here. Who am I, and who are you? Moses says to God, who am I, that I should go to the Pharaoh, and that I should bring the children of Israel out of Egypt? So he said, I will certainly be with you, and this shall be a sign to you that I have sent you. When you have brought the people out of Egypt, you shall serve God on this mountain. Then Moses says to God, indeed, when I come to the children of Israel and I say to them, the God of your fathers has sent me to you, and they say to me, what is his name, what shall I say to them? And God says to Moses, I am that I am. And he said, thus, you shall say to the children of Israel, I am has sent me to you. This is my name forever, and this is my memorial to all generations. My name is I am that I am. Now every single time that you use the words, I am, you are citing the name of God, right from the holiest books. And every time you say the words, I am weak, I am poor, I am unlucky, I am unhappy, I am sick, I am unable to attract into my life what you want, you are desecrating the name of God. God did not say, I will be. My name is, I hope things work out well. My name is, maybe things will show up that I wanted, but possibly not. He said, I am that I am. You must be conscious of how you use these words, m. I am strong. I am well. I am content. Even if your senses tell you something different, I am. And as we move now into the meat of this program, you'll see that putting the words, I am, in front of something into your mind and imagination is a very powerful way to attract into your life, recognizing your own divinity. I am God is not blasphemy. It is your identity.

BaBette Davidson: Hello, I'm babette davidson, and I just think it's remarkable that Wayne Dyer helps us think about things in a whole new way, and that's what PBS is all about, a marketplace of ideas and wonderful ideas from Wayne Dyer. We're so glad to have you with us, Dr. Dyer. 
Wayne Dyer: Thank you. 
BaBette Davidson: Thank you so, so much. I have to say I loved the story about you being on the internet list and it's somewhat comforting that someone of your higher place still struggles with ego every once in a while. 
Wayne Dyer: Well, I don't know how much of a struggle it is, it's kind of a joke. I just did a thing with Eckhart Tolle, and we streamed all over the country, we had a lot of fun with it. But it's always there, there's always this part of us that is wanting to be number one and wanting to be better than someone else and wanting to own things. 
BaBette Davidson: Oh absolutely. I think everyone can, everyone can relate to that. And you want to be, you want to be better than that, we all do. Um, speaking of that list though, I saw it on the internet and I thought, oh absolutely, and if they had asked me, I would've put you right up there at number one. 
Wayne Dyer: Well thank you, thank you. I'm pushing for votes here. 
BaBette Davidson: You're pushing. You have helped me, I was thinking about all the things you helped inspire me through: the loss of parents and loved ones, and parenting and relationships. 
Wayne Dyer: Sickness in your family. 
BaBette Davidson: Sickness in my family. You have helped me so much and I have used and shared the thank you gifts in the past so much, I'm so glad you're back. I can't wait to use these and we have a wonderful bunch of gifts this time. 
Wayne Dyer: Yes, bunches is the right word, we're calling it. Are you ready for this? 
BaBette Davidson: I'm ready! 
Wayne Dyer: The big banana. 
BaBette Davidson: I like it! 
Wayne Dyer: It's lina that gave me that, that coming from Hawaii. 
BaBette Davidson: The big banana, I love it. 
Wayne Dyer: This is big banana. And we're going to pass this around back there. 
BaBette Davidson: Well walk us through what's in the whole bunch. 
Wayne Dyer: Well, it's really a multimedia library. And when we put this whole program together, I had decided that I really wanted to give somethg that was equivalent in value if we could possibly it, to what we're asking people to contribute to uh, to PBS. So what we put together, you can see it on the screen here. First of all there's the book, the "Wishes Fulfilled," book, which I spent the last year, year and a half, of my life working on and writing and practicing. 

[00:49:47]


BaBette Davidson: And I started reading it, it's amazing. 
Wayne Dyer: Thank you. 
BaBette Davidson: It's amazing. 
Wayne Dyer: It's uh, I think it's going to be a life-changing book for a lot of people. It certainly was for me and for my entire family. So, we tried to be as specific as we possibly could here, but how to apply, learning how to manifest things into your life. We also have the DVD of the, of this entire show, with additional bonus material. Now that bonus material is almost a full hour. And uh, it includes interviews, I talked in the beginning, you asked about me about being well, I tell in there, in the bonus material, because we just didn't have enough time with the show, about this remarkable experience I had with this divine healer down in Brazil, his name is John of God, who helped me to just overcome this leukemia, or at least the impact of it in my life. So I tell that story, there's a comedian on there, Sarah Sweet who is very, very funny, she there, who is very, very funny, she warmed up the audience, and an interview with the lady you are going to see in the next segment. So that's the DVD of the entire show, and the bonus material, and we also have a second book, hardcover brand new book, called "Dying To Be Me," I'm not going to talk too much about it right here, because in the next segment, you're going to meet this woman, and she's one of the most remarkable people I've ever seen in my life. If you know anybody in the audience, that would like to benefit from someone who's had an incredible near-death experience and come back, call them and let them know that it's coming up in the next segment. So we have that book, and then we have the seminar, which is really, we did this over on Maui, you're hearing here a couple of hours on the show that you're watching, "Wishes Fulfilled." This is an entire two full days of going through and this is in great depth, with a lot of humor, a lot of stories, and a lot of involvement. The "Secrets of," it's six CDs. In addition to that, we have what I think of as, as the coup of this. I think if you've ever had the wish in your life, to go to Assisi in Italy, Lourdes in France, and Medjugorje in Bosnia, these are places where miracles have taken place. I'm going to talk to you a little bit more about that a little bit later on, but I gave a two-hour lecture in each one of these places. Something happens BaBette when you go to these places, you become inspired. Something just almost enters into your consciousness. I gave lectures that I've never given before and I don't think I could ever give again, they were all filmed right there. So that's on there as well, there's four full DVDs on there. And then we have the "I Am: Wishes Fulfilled" meditation. You just heard me talking about it in the last segment. This is where they took the actual sounds that are, correspond to the letters in the original Hebrew going back into the Torah, and created a sound that is the same sound as "I am that I am," as God spoke to Moses. 

[00:52:36]


BaBette Davidson: Oh nice. 
Wayne Dyer: You can meditate to this, I explain it in the first track on here on how to use it. It's something that I do, my children do, my family does it together and it's one of the most beautiful, profound sounds you've ever seen. 
BaBette Davidson: And wayne, I must say, I so appreciate the care that you give in the selection of all of these thank you gifts, and I know how much you love and appreciate the people that follow you and love your work. So thank you for that. 
Wayne Dyer: You're very welcome. 
BaBette Davidson: You're going to hear about that in just a moment, but right now, Lina Heil is here, with our phone volunteers to encourage you to make that very important call in support of this PBS station. Lina? 
Lina Heil: Hello, I'm lina heil. In the past 22 minutes, you've been exposed to Neville Goddard, Uell Andersen; two American philosophers, whom you may be learning about for the very first time. You also heard quotes from the Bible, both the Old and New Testaments, from the great poet, T.S. Eliot and the eastern sage, Eva Canada It all adds up to extraordinary television experience. Which you deserve, because remember what Dr. Dyer told us, we are all extraordinary.

BaBette Davidson: Wayne, you always bring us the most fascinating people, I'm wondering where you find them. And, I'm reading in your book, and Neville says in here, "To be transformed, the whole basis of your thoughts must change, but your thoughts cannot change unless you have new ideas." So where do you get those new ideas? 
Wayne Dyer: Well, these new ideas like everything else, all come from one place, from source. I say in the program, and I say it here. There's many bodies in the world, but there's only one mind. And when you open yourself up to the infinite possibilities of who you are, you get infinite numbers of ideas. And the right people begin to show up. I did a program not too long ago, with Immaculee Ilibagiza another one with Dan Caro, I mean, these are unbelievable people and so is the lady you're going to see in the next segment coming up to the show, Anita Moorjani, truly one of the most significant people I've ever known in my life. 
BaBette Davidson: And only on pbs would you have an entire lecture on television to introduce you to new ideas. 
Wayne Dyer: Right. 
BaBette Davidson: The other thing that i love that you always do is you share the most beautiful poetry. And you had a bit you wanted to share with us today. 
Wayne Dyer: Well, the whole story about moses, back in the Torah, 3,300 years ago, Elizabeth Barrett Browning, inthe 1860s, wrote a poem about that encounter with God, with Moses, and the words go like this, she 
said: "Earths crammed with heaven." I just love that line. "Earths crammed with heaven. And every burning bush, a fire with God. And those, but only he who sees, takes off his shoes, the rest sit round it, and pluck blackberries." And what she's saying is you have to See, with a capital "S," and that's when God said to Moses, take off your sandals, this is a holy place. 

[00:57:37]


BaBette Davidson: I love that. And it's the people who see and watch PBS and appreciate, are the ones who are gonna be calling, everyone else will be eating blackberries. So we hope that you see, and that you're going to the phone right now to say thank you to this Pbs station for bringing you Dr. Wayne Dyer and these beautiful ideas.

Dr. Dyer: Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. In my study of the work that I mentioned earlier, particularly the work of Neville, and the work of U. S. Andersen, and The "I Am" Discourses, I came up with, in putting that all together, five, what I call five Wishes Fulfilled foundations for being able to attract into your world and become the kind of person that you expect yourself to be. Remember what I said about the quote on this wall of the swimming pool. If you want to accomplish anything, which means to become an extraordinary level of consciousness person, you must first expect it of yourself. You must see yourself and be unafraid to say to yourself, I am connected at always, at all times, to my source, to the divine mind, to the Tao, to God, to that which is the creator of all. I am a part of it. And the first of these five foundations I call imagination. Imagination. Many of our greatest thinkers have spoken about the power of imagination. William Blake said that, what is now proved was once only imagined. Now think about the importance of that. If you want to have something show up in your life, the kind of person you would like to become, manifest something new into your life, something powerful, whatever it might be, you obviously must first be able to imagine it. Your imagination, this is yours and yours alone. You can place anything into your imagination that you want to place there. Independent of what anybody else says about it, independent of what your senses tell you, independent of all the evidence that may be to the contrary, you can place into your imagination an I am that represents what you would like to attract into your life and make it come into fruition. Einstein's most famous quote, one of his most famous observations, he said, imagination is more important than knowledge. Knowledge is limited. Imagination encircles the world. Placing these I ams into your imagination I had a, some of you, I'm sure, know about it because it's been all over the papers and so on, a diagnosis of leukemia, a couple of years ago. And for awhile, I kind of began to believe some of the things that were being told to me about what happens when you have this particular kind of leukemia. And I have, instead, in the last year or so, had some of the most amazing, astonishing things happen into my life, where I have felt just so, I was just so alive and so strengthened, and so fully connected to my source, knowing, I mean, basically, I have a knowing in here that life itself is a sexually transmitted, terminal disease. Okay? I mean, that's basicallythe fact, all right? So I'm not saying that all you have to put into your imagination an I am that says, I am, and you're going to live forever. It isn't, that isn't, but every moment that you do have, until you are called, can be a moment of exquisite, extraordinary power, living from that place, and that's the decision that I made. I have never felt so powerful as I have the last several years, since I recognized the power that I have in my imagination to place something there and live from it. Einstein once said, if you want your children to be intelligent, read them fairytales. If you want your children to be more intelligent, read them more fairytales. It's one of the reasons I've taken to writing children's books, to give children an opportunity to explore that thing called their imagination, from the time that they're just little boys and little girls. And what I have in my imagination is a do-not-disturb sign, and it's like mentally inside, I've placed that in there, I do not, anyone to dturb or try to change around anything that I have placed in there about what is possible for me. So you never want to place into your imagination any thought that you would not want to materialize. You never want to allow in your imagination to be contaminated by the way life used to be. Your imagination is yours. Don't let any other people influence you. Never allow people's ideas about what is possible or impossible for you to occupy your imagination. I've called it, throughout my life, I've called it being a scurvy elephant. When I was in the third grade, I was living in a foster home out in Mount Clemens, Michigan, and I came home from school, and I talked to Mrs. Scarf, and I said, Mrs. Scarf, what's a scurvy elephant? And she said, where did you hear that? And I said, I don't know, Mrs. Pool, my third-grade teacher was talking to the principal, Mrs. Smith, and she said, Wayne Dyer was in this classroom, and called me a scurvy elephant. So she got on the phone, and she called up, and the principal said, oh, that's Wayne, he gets everything mixed up. She didn't say that he was a scurvy elephant in her classroom, she said that he was a disturbing element in her classroom. A disturbing element is someone who has in their imagination the possibility that they can do anything, that all things are possible. Again, it's one of those great lines from the New Testament, with God, all things are possible. Now you tell me, what does that leave out? What does all things are possible leave out? That doesn't leave out the possibility that we can defy gravity, that we can soar, that we can heal ourselves, that we can create magnificent prosperity in our life, that we can change the world. I said at one of the breaks here, to the audience here tonight, I really believe that if this message gets out there into the world, we can shift the consciousness of this planet. If enough of us begin to believe, we're placing into our imagination a world that we want to live in that has no limitations and that is based on living from a place of love and kindness and God-consciousness and spiritual awareness, divine mind at work. I believe it's possible. Thank you. So we have to do it with our imagination. It has to begin with our imagination. Collectively, if enough of us begin to believe that we can create that kind of a world, if Public Television can put on these kinds of programs, which is why I am a part of Publi Television, because this is what they broadcast. This is what comes into our homes, the energy of all things are possible, not the energy of violence and hatred and, you know, and all of the silly stuff that you see so frequently on commercial and cable television, especially the violence and especially the rude communication between young children and their parents and so on. You don't see that here. It's why I'm here raising money for this station, and all Public Television stations. Einstein, once again, this man of imagination said, logic will get you from A to B, but imagination will take you everywhere. That's the first of these Wishes Fulfilled foundations. The second foundation is very significant and very important. I call it, living from the end. This is one of the harder ones for people to get, but I'd like you to go, again, to the New Testament, look at Romans 4:17, in the presence of him, whom he believe God, who gives life to the dead and calls those things which do not exist as though they did, and calls those things which do not exist as though they did. Those are very important, significant words. You have to be able to call the things which you have not seen yet materialize and manifest into your physical world. You have to be able to say to yourself, I call those things that I would like to become as if they already do. And you place into your imagination, fearlessly, the I ams which you would like to create for yourself. And when it's time for me to write another book, I don't even know what it's going to be. I just know that it starts germinating inside me, and it's like a calling, it's like a passion. And I'm over there at my writing space, and before I do, I comup with the title, and before I even write one word, I, I did it with this book, Wishes Fulfilled, this, I take a jacket, which is, this isn't even my book. And I take this jacket, and I ask the art department at Hay House if they will please design a book with this title, and I put it around another book, which that I have done, and I set it on my writing space, next to Ralph Waldo Emerson, and Jesus Christ's picture, and Paramahansa Yogananda, and my children, and the people that I love deeply and profoundly in my life, and I look at it with three white candles that I light every single time I sit over there, and I look at that jacket, and I, it's as if I call those things. The book does not exist. I call it as if it did. When my leukemia diagnosis came in, the information that was sent to me continuously was it's incurable, this is something that you can't change. And I would say to my children, who would send me this stuff, I'd say, I'd really appreciate it if you didn't send me that kind of stuff. And they'd say, what do you mean? Why do you, why, Dad? Why wouldn't you want us to send that? It says that right in there. I said, what part of I am well is it that you don't understand? Because I have placed that into my imagination. I have a wonderful quote by the man I've cited before, his name is Neville, and it goes like this. He says, disregard appearances, conditions, in fact, disregard all evidence of your senses, that is, what your eyes and ears tell you, that deny the fulfillment of your desire, whatever it is you want to attract into your life. Disregard appearances, conditions, in fact, all evidence of your senses that deny the fulfillment of your desire. Rest in the assumption that you already are what you want to be, for in that determined assumption, you and your infinite being, your extraordinary self, which is what this program is about, are merged in creative unity, and with your infinite being, God, all things are possible. God never fails, and you are a piece of that which never fails. And you are going to move beyond just being a piece, and just being a fragment, and just being a segment, until it becomes your overwhelming knowing, that you have within you this divine capacity. You don't need evidence of your senses. I wrote a book a few years back, the title of it, I had to get my publisher because they didn't understand it, they called back, they said, I think you got this wrong. I said, no. It's called, You'll See It When You Believe It. Not the other way around. People will say, well, I'll believe it when I see it. It doesn't work that way. You will see it when inside you have a knowing. And Neville also said, therefore, to incarnate a new and a greater value of yourself, you must assume that you already are what you want to be, and then live by faith in this assumption. Now this flies in the face of so much of what you've been told, because you have a tendency to believe that what your eyes and ears tell you is reality. But this is what we know by our senses, just this little tiny fragment. I can't even get, you know, it's like a millionth of a millimeter, and all that is unknown is in the invisible, in the imagination. And most of our attention is focused on, this is my beliefs and my disbeliefs about what is possible and what isn't possible, are here, and it's an endless, an endless universe. So placing I ams into your imagination is one thing, it's an intellectual act. Living from the end means that you call the things which do not exist as if they did. You begin to say to yourself, you don't have to say it to anyone else, you don't have to write it down, you don't have to get anybody else's approval, you don't have to look on the Internet, you don't have to do anything like that. I have had such a magical experience. While I was writing Wishes Fulfilled, I had, I had so many divine things come into my life. I had a man who lives down in Brazil, in Abadiania, named John of God come into my life, in a way that was so profoundly life-changing that it's almost hard for me to find the words to express it. At the same time, I had a woman come into my life, a woman from Bulgaria. This country is just on me. She's here tonight. Her name is Mira Kelly. And she brought with her something off of the Internet about a near-death experience, about a woman in Hong Kong whose name is Anita Moorjani. She's an author, a Hay House author now, and she's written a book, a powerful book. And I read this story about Anita, and it seems that on the 2nd of February, in the year 2006, this woman was wheeled into a hospital in Hong Kong. She had been sick for five years. Her organs had all shut down. Her family was gathered at the emergency room, her husband, who is here tonight, I'm honored to have met, beautiful man, named Danny. And the doctors had told her family and her husband that these were her last hours. She was down to 86 or 88 pounds. Anita emerged from her coma, some 30 hours in a coma, and she has a story to tell that is so compelling, she's here from Hong Kong to share with you some of the lessons that she learned while she was in this comatose state and what she came back to teach us. She's one of the most beautiful human beings I've ever been privileged to know, and honored to support, and write a foreword for her book, and she's here with us today, and I'd love you to meet her. Anita Moorjani, please, come up. Be seated. 

[01:17:55]


Moorjani: Thank you. Hi, good evening, everyone. 
Dr. Dyer: Tell us, anita, you're in a coma, your husband is whispering in your ear, your mother is there, your brother's on his way to see you, everybody's waiting for you to take your last breath. What were you observing, and what did you learn, and what did you come back to teach us? 
Moorjani: Wow. There's so much there. Even though I was in a coma, I was actually aware of everything that was happening around me. I'm sorry, I still get emotional when I think of that state. It was, it was five years ago, but I still remember it as if it was, it was yesterday. I was in a coma, but I was aware of everything the doctors were doing. I was aware of my husband. My mother was crying. She was, because the doctors had told them that, that I only had a few more hours to live, my organs had shut down, and these were my last hours. And, and I wanted to assure them that, that I was feeling fine, that I was feeling great, but I couldn't. I, I couldn understand why I couldn't communicate with them. And each time it felt as though I was getting involved in the drama, and my emotions were being pulled towards feeling for my mother and my brother, at the same time, it was as though I was being pulled away, and it was as though my energy, or my awareness, or consciousness was just expanding. And it was just expanding and expanding, and just getting bigger and bigger. And it felt as though I could feel what everybody was feeling. I could feel what my husband was feeling, what my mother was feeling, and the doctors, as they were running around trying to, trying to save my life. And then I became aware of what I can only describe as unconditional love. It was as though I was, it was as though I was just surrounded, or embraced, by this unconditional love. And when I say unconditional, I mean really unconditional. It was like I didn't have to do anything to prove myself or to be anything, or I was loved unconditionally, regardless. It, it was as though, even, even things that I could have perceived to have done wrong in my life, it wasn't as though I was being judged. There was no judgment whatsoever. There was only compassion. It was like compassion, and it was like I understood, in that state, why, why I would do whatever I did in life. It was, everything I did was out of the limitation of being in a physical body. 

[01:21:03]


Dr. Dyer: So you were looking at your body, and you were given a choice, is that right, whether to get back into this sick, sick body. 
Moorjani: That's right. 
Dr. Dyer: Or not. And what did you do? 
Moorjani: I became aware, actually, I became aware of the presence of my father. He had passed away 10 years before me. And I also became aware of my best friend, who had passed away two years before and I had missed her desperately, because she was like a sister to me. 
Dr. Dyer: And did you feel, when you were in that near-death experience state, in that coma, watching it, that coming back also meant that you had something to teach everyone? And what was it that you felt you had to teach them? 
Moorji: I felt that I had to come back because there was a greater purpose. Because at first, I didn't want to come back into my body, because my body was so sick, and it, there was just so much unconditional love on that side. It's really, really hard to leave, so if anybody has lost anyone, I can completely understand why they would stay there. But also, I seemed to get the message. I seemed to understand that it wasn't my time, and I had a mission. I had a purpose, and I had not yet fulfilled. And I seemed to understand that, even in order to fulfill my purpose, I wouldn't have to really go and figure it out, or I wouldn't have to pursue anything. I would just have to go back and live fearlessly and just not be afraid to be myself, and that's all I had to do. I also sensed that my husband and I still had a purpose to fulfill. My husband is, he's truly my soul mate, because he was there talking to me all the way through, talking in my ear, and holding my hand, and I was aware of that. 
Dr. Dyer: You learned some very important things. Was it like just about being positive, to be a positive thinker, was that. 
Moorjani: No, in fact, being positive is not enough. I used to always be positive, because I was a people-pleaser. I used to always stay positive, because I never wanted to bother anyone or trouble anyone. I learnt that more important than being positive is being yourself. I learnt that that's actually the most important thing, is to be yourself, because that's why we're here. We're here because we're, we're facets of one. It was as though we are all one. Without my body, it felt as though I was connected to everyone and everything. 

[01:23:29]


Dr. Dyer: Was fear a big part of your life and had something to do with this. 
Moorjani: With being ill. 
Dr. Dyer: Your being sick? 
Moorjani: Yes, fear was a big part of my life before I was sick. I used to live a life in fear, a fear of not being good enough, fear of everything, fear of illness, fear of not meeting other people's expectations, and, but my near-death experience taught me that there's nothing to fear. In fact, when I was given the choice, I felt I reached a point where I had the choice of whether to come back or not, and it was my father and my best friend who actually said, now that you know who you truly are, go back and live your life fearlessly. 
Dr. Dyer: And have you been doing that? 
Moorkani: Yes, I have. 
Dr. Dyer: Ladies and gentlemen, anita moorjani. 
BaBette Davidson: I love her countenance, and I want to meet her sweet husband. What a wonderful, remarkable story. Hello, I'm BaBette Davidsond it's my honor to be here at this PBS station with Dr. Wayne Dyer. Wayne, what a remarkable thing. I understand that Anita had received a diagnosis of an end-stage cancer. 
Wayne Dyer: Right. 
BaBette Davidson: And since she left the hospital, after her experience there, she's been living a health life and her current diagnosis is that she's cancer-free? 
Wayne Dyer: She is cancer-free. As a matter of fact, within just a matter of four or five days, the tumor that she had in her body had been reduced by 70%, and within four weeks, she was completely cancer-free. They couldn't find, they were doing biopsies and so on, and they couldn't find any place to even do a biopsy and it was just, she absolutely had this amazing story to tell. No one, who has ever been at that end stage of cancer, ever, has come back and been able to talk about it. 
BaBette Davidson: Well, as I was listening to her story, this is one of those times when I think of the bonus material because there's an extended version, I wanted to hear more, I want to know more. 

[01:25:37]


Wayne Dyer: Right. 
BaBette Davidson: More of this remarkable story and that is on the bonus material. 
Wayne Dyer: It is on the bonus material and the DVD if you pledge for the big you know, the whole banana, which is right there, and at the $100 level, I do an extended interview with her which is an amazing story. This is, this is what we call the big banana, the whole banana, it's a multimedia library that contains many, many wonderful things. First of all the book, "Wishes Fulfilled," which is a book that I spent a year, the last year and a half or so of my life immersed in. At the end of every chapter, I have very specific suggestions about how to manifest into your life the kinds of things that you think you don't have the possibility to do. There's also a DVD of this entire show, which I have right here, with that additional bonus material, with my interview, not only with her, it's almost a full hour of additional material. And it's also myself with uh, telling the whole story of my healing with John of God, which is just another one of those. Have you heard about John of God? 
BaBette Davidson: I have heard of him, but I didn't know about your experience with him until this program. 
Wayne Dyer: He's an amazing, amazing being and he's treated something like 25 million people over the last 40 years and never charged anybody anything for it, he's really a divine being. He was very instrumental in that as well. We also have the book, "Dying To Be Me," Anita's full story. She calls it, "My journey from cancer to near death to true healing." One of the most amazing, you said, you were impressed by her countenance, um, I've seen her with other people. She can go back into that state now, and she just changes. Everything about her seems to change. I've seen her do amazing things you know and just being in her presence. You know, you're in the presence of, I think of her as like a saint, to me. 
BaBette Davidson: Just reading the back of the jacket, I have to tell you, I just felt so much comfort, I cannot wait to share this book with my mother, who is, I think she'll find comfort. My father passed five years ago, but I think she's gonna be comforted by that. 
Wayne Dyer: I think so as well. Lina had told the story, before this, you had read the back of the jacket here, didn't you Lina, and you had lost your mom just recently and that you had said that it comforted you. Just tell them what you had told me. 

[01:27:50]


Lina Heil: Thanks, wayne. And you know, I got to read the jacket and my mom Irmgard, a beautiful, vibrant, vivacious woman, passed away after suffering from seven years of ovarian cancer in August. And we're all with her when she passed, but we couldn't hear her, we couldn't talk to her, but she c hear us. And when I read that jacket, I said, this is amazing, this is what my mother must have seen, and I encourage you, that if you have had a loved one pass, or someone you love has had someone pass, this is an amazing book that I think you'll certainly benefit from. It really was amazing to read that. 
Wayne Dyer: Thank you just for sharing that. We also have in this, I'm still going through the whole big banana here. 
BaBette Davidson: There's so much in it. 
Wayne Dyer: We have an entire seminar, which is six CDs, what you're hearing here is a couple of hours, this is just two full days of, people have paid hundreds of dollars to come to, on Maui, no less. So we do the entire seminar on "Secrets of Manifesting." We also have the "Experiencing the Miraculous" tour, which I'm inviting you to go on a tour with me to these venerated places, I gave lectures in these cities, in Lourdes, Medjugorje, particularly in Assisi, that I've never given before. I don't even know what happened to me, I was just sort of taken over by that. And we also have, in addition to that, the six DVDs and the seven CDs, we have the meditation. 
BaBette Davidson: The meditation cds. 
Wayne Dyer: The meditation cd which teaches you how to manifest by using meditating to the sounds of creation, literally the sounds of creation. 
BaBette Davidson: I have to tell you, wayne, this is just an amazing collection of thank you gis and we appreciate every person that's called. I know that lives will be changed when calls are made and these thank you gifts are in your home, and you're using them. I use you all the time to keep me on track. If you'd like to be kept on track with Wayne Dyer, give us a call right now. And here are just a few ways we say thank you when you make that phone call. 
[Music Playing] 

[01:30:10]


Lina Heil: As anita talks about fearlessness, is a very inspiring idea. And this PBS station is truly fearless TV. We present stories of everyday women and men who lived fearlessly in the past, who are continuing to push forward without fear, and those stories serve as models for ourselves and our children. The station is renowned for bringing you programs like the "Freedom Riders," who are the true modern history heroes. "American Experience" has brought to life the working girls of the Triangle Shirtwaist Fire. Young women who played as important a role in US history as Dolley Madison, who has also been profiled in that series. "Frontline," of course, is fearless television at its best. Bringing critical stories about our world today with on-the-ground exposes, of business tycoons, of political tyrants, and where else will you find people who are willing to fearlessly ask the really hard questions, but on the "NewsHour," and "Charlie Rose." Our ability to continue to bring you this kind of thought-provoking programming, is tied directly to your continued financial support. This was the vision of the fearless founders of public broadcasting, who believed that television could be more than just a momentary entertainment. So we're asking you to step to the plate right now. Your contribution keeps us courageous. And your reward is the program you're watching now with Dr. Wayne Dyer. And the rest of the schedule here that you love so well. Please call the number on your screen, or visit our secure website. Thank you. 
BaBette Davidson: Wayne, one of my favorite parts of your lecture so far is the scurvy elephant story, because I have a scurvy elephant at home. 
Wayne Dyer: Do you? 
BaBette Davidson: I have one. 
Wayne Dyer: Well that's because you were one. 
BaBette Davidson: I was one! That's true! 
Wayne Dyer: I got eight of them, so. 
BaBette Davidson: And I love the "do not disturb" sign on your imagination. I think that's what PBS does, it has a "Do not disturb" sign on imagination and thought, but I love your focus on children and of course that ties into what we do for children. And I love your children's books. I've shared them with my own children, and now my grandchin. 
Wayne Dyer: Really? 
BaBette Davidson: Yes! 
Wayne Dyer: You have grandchildren? 
BaBette Davidson: I have grandchildren, and this is, these are beautiful. 

[01:32:10]


Wayne Dyer: Well, I've written, this is my fifth children's book, and one of the things I'm most proud of, is that I get letters from teachers all over the country. As a matter of fact, schoolteachers are the ones that use these books more than anyone else in their program. 
BaBette Davidson: They're very empowering. 
Wayne Dyer: Yes. And so, I've just been, my co-author Kristina Tracy who I have to give an enormous amount of credit for this, because she really does all of the work, she just takes my ideas and puts them into 
this, and this book is called "I Am: Why Two Little Words Mean So Much." I just think it's really important for little children, I talk in the very beginning of the show that we're raised to be ordinary. And that starts when we're just very, very little. We tell children what their limitations are, this is what you can do, this is what you can't do, this is what's impossible, these are the limitations, this is the world that you live in. And I think, as Einstein said, let them read fairytales and read more fairytales. Fairytales are something that lets their imagination just soar and become all that they want to be. Never put restrictions on what your kids have in their imagination. Not only your kids, but in your own imagination as well. 
BaBette Davidson: And that's what I need. You know, this whole metaphor that you've done of walking down the street has, I have come up with a metaphor for you. 
Wayne Dyer: Is that right? 
BaBette Davidson: I think you are our gps system because when I watch a Wayne Dyer show, it's the best kind of "recalculating" advice that you can receive, and without the annoying voice, you have a much nicer voice than "turn left." And there's so much information that you give us, and I try so hard. I go out everyday with good intentions and you help me. You help me recalculate. And you come up with these great five foundations, these five steps. 
Wayne Dyer: Right, which is what we're going through now. This whole idea of your imagination and living from the end, I was just watching the show, you know, as we're preparing to do these breaks, and uh, I think most people don't know how to really say "I am" already what it is that I would like to become. They think, you know, then I'm fooling myself, I'm engaging in self-delusion. It's not self-delusion. Everything that exists in the world was once imagined. And if you can't imagine it, then you can't create it. It's like, that's why we fly in airplanes today because somebody went down to Kitty Hawk and said they didn't imagine that this thing was going to stay on the ground. They imagined it going into the air, and this is what you have to be able to do. 

[01:34:23]


BaBette Davidson: I love that. 
Wayne Dyer: Yeah, I do too. 
BaBette Davidson: It's an empowering message and I can tell you from personal experience that using Wayne's books, listening to those DVDs, and the CDs, these are things that are going to help you reach the goals that you've set for yourself. To see those and to remove those limitations. So think about that as you go to the phone, these wonderful thank you gifts are there to help you be your highest self. 
Narrator: You have your choice of wonderful thank you gifts for a contribution to this station. Please, call the number on your screen or visit us online. 
Lina Heil: Isn't it truly wonderful that Dr. Wayne Dyer is such a passionate supporter of PBS and this public television station. Our goal is to engage your passion and support as well. It can be a challenge to send in a financial contribution for a service that appears to come into your home "for free," but actually, the work we do here at this PBS station, everyday, 24-7, has a real cost. And that must get covered. So while you think that you're getting us for free, in fact, we have to come up with our own funding to air programs just like this one. A viewer like you who makes a financial contribution is what makes this station stay on the air. Without you there would be no "NOVA," no "Masterpiece," "Austin City Limits," no "Antiques Roadshow," or the special programs that are designed for teachers and students throughout this community. You still have time to show this station how much you appreciate this program. This public television station is your personal connection to amazing people like Wayne Dyer. You've got the best front-row seat in the house. Call the number on your screen and show your support. Thank you. 
BaBette Davidson: Well now you've taken that front-row seat across the pond to Europe. 
Wayne Dyer: Right. 
BaBette Davidson: Because I was not able to go on this wonderful trip that you did to experience the miraculous. I wanted to, and now I have a chance to see it, because you're offering this as a part of the whole, the big banana, the whole bunch. 
Wayne Dyer: Well, many of you out there have said that I have a wish in my life that I would like to see some of these venerated, spiritual places in the world, where absolute, true miracles have taken place. In Assisi, I had an amazing healing I talked about in b film that I did called "The Shift." It was uh, so I went back there and gave a lecture there, that I don't, I've never even lectured like that before, something just, I often said that St. Francis must have just entered my body because something just. And I've never given a lecture like that and I'll never be able to give it again. We filmed every bit of it. We went to Lourdes, the very same thing happened there in Lourdes. And we went to Medjugorje, where in 1981, these six children saw the blessed mother and received, and they still receive them 30 years later. They're receiving the same messages. So we filmed every single aspect of it. If you can't fulfill a wish to go there, if it's not possible because of financing, or whatever, this is as close as you're going to ever get to it. And you're going to hear me speaking in these beautiful, spiritual, just phenomenal places with all of the settings as well. So every single bit of it is there for you. And that's a part of the big banana. 

[01:37:35]


BaBette Davidson: And this is part of what I love about you, Wayne. Is that you share of yourself. You share your spirit, you share your experiences. We hope you appreciate that and the fact that Wayne chooses to share all of this on this PBS station. And he's on PBS because he cares about the programs that we air, we know you're watching because you care, so make that call right now. We're going back to more of Wayne, "Wishes Fulfilled." 
Wayne Dyer: Thank you and god bless you.

Dr. Dyer: Thank you, thank you. It gets better and better, honestly. It's hard to top Anita Moorjani's story, but the lessons are very, very profound here. The third Wishes Fulfilled foundation is called, assume the feeling of the wish fulfilled. Assume the feeling of the wish fulfilled. So here's where we are. We have used our imagination. We have placed something into our imagination as an I am, which is the name of God. I am strong. I am healthy. I am kind. I am prosperous. I am getting the job that I'm applying for. I am, whatever it might be, I am. And then you have practiced calling it as if that which does not exist as though it did. And then you move now from the world of the intellect, because understanding something intellectually is very different than understanding something spiritually. To understand something spiritually, you must experience it. And in order to experience it, you have to experience it in your imagination as an I am, but you must be able to feel it. Our feelings are the things that take place in our body. It says, Neville says, and I have this on the, next to my bed, where I live in Maui, make your future dream a present fact by assuming feeling of the wish fulfilled. So whatever it is that you would like to experience in your life, this, remember, your imagination is yours. Everything that now exists was once imagined. Therefore, everything that is going to exist must first be imagined. Okay? Henry David Thoreau had probably the greatest definition of success that I have ever heard. He said, if you advance confidently in the direction of your own dreams, and endeavor to live the life which you have imagined, you will meet with a success unexpected in common hours. It will chase after you, if you can place into your imagination what it is that you would like to attract, and begin to feel it. Listen to Neville. This is one of my most favorite quotes from The Power of Awareness. That which you feel yourself to be, you are. And you are given that which you are. So, assume the feeling that would be yours, were you already in possession of your wish, and your wish must be realized. So live in the feeling of being the one you want to be, and that you shall be. Every feeling makes a subconscious impression, and unless it is counteracted by a more powerful feeling of an opposite nature, it must be expressed. Your feelings are different from your thoughts. Your feelings are what you experience in your body. A dominant of two feelings is the one expressed. I am healthy is a stronger feeling than I will be healthy. I am healthy says, I feel healthy, and I feel healthy. I feel great. I don't determine if I am well on the basis of what it says on a piece of paper, or on the basis of what somebody else out there tells me. I live my life feeling within my body that I am strong, I am capable, I am able. And that is not just something that I say. It's not just an affirmation. An affirmation is an intellectual exercise. This is a spiritual knowing within that I am well, I am content, I am prosperous. But the words that Neville used there are the subconscious. Every feeling that you have makes a subconscious impression upon your body and upon your awareness. Now, you need to understand this subconscious mind of yours. our subconscious mind rules your life. Ninety-six to 97% of everything that you do is done as a result of your subconscious mind. And when your subconscious mind gets programmed, it goes ahead and responds to whatever it is your conscious mind has placed into it. I was 18 years o. I was in the United States Navy for four years. And they sent me to a school in Bainbridge, Maryland, to become a radioman and a cryptographer. And we spent an hour a day, every day, for the first three or four weeks we were there on a typewriter learning Morse code. Okay? And my conscious mind had to program my subconscious mind. his subconious mind of yours is operating all the time. You're sitting here watching a television show. You got up, you picked up your remote control, you turned the channel on, you got dressed, you ate lunch, you went to the bathroom, you go to work, you get into your car, you drive to work, you put, you don't think about what I'm going to do. And everything that is going on in your life, everything, everybody in here in this room, you know, you got here through your subconscious mind. You didn't have to think about every single thing that you were doing, but there was a time when you did, in order to learn that. This habitual, subconscious mind of yours rules your life. So I'm 18 years old, I'm taking Morse code. Di-dah-dah, here's the alphabet, a little bit of it anyway, di-dah, dah-di-di-dit, dah-di-dah-dit, dah-di-dit, dit, di-di-dah-dit, h-dah-dit, di-di-di-dit, di-dit, di-dah-dah-dah, dah-di-dah, di-dah-di-dit, dah-dah, dah-dit, dah-dah-dah, di-dah-dah-dit. That's A through P, check it out. That's 53 years ago, and my subconscious mind is still keeping track of the dah-di-di-dit dah-dah-dah dah-di-di-dit di-di-dah. You're doing the same thing, only you don't use Morse code, but you've programmed your subconscious mind with di-di-di-dit dah-di-dit, I can't do that, di-di-dit dah-di-dit, I'm not very attractive, di-di-dit dah-dah-dit, I'm overweight. Di-di-dit dah-dah-dah dah-di-di-dah, I can't do, make things happen. And it's di-di-dit dah-di-dit dah-di-dah, still there, 53 years later. You, and you go through your life with this subconscious programming with a, with an awareness that you are not in charge. You're not able to extend or transcend this, this way of thinking. This subconscious mind of yours is most impacted by your feelings. A change of feeling is a change of destiny. A change of feeling is a change of destiny. Write it down. Stick it on the wall next to your bed. If you came into where I sleep, you would see that. I look at that all the time. I want to practice putting into my subconscious mind the assumption of the feeling of what it is that I would like to attract into my life as if it already existed and to feel it. Not just to think it, but to feel it. Neville's law of assumption says this. If this assumption about what you wld like to become is persisted in until it becomes your dominant feeling, the attainment of your ideal is absolutely inevitable. You must first assume the feeling of a wish fulfilled in all aspects of your life. So, you have to say to yourself, what does it feel like to be prosperous? What does it feel like to be content? What does it feel like to be well? And I had to remind myself of that when I had this leukemia diagnosis. I had to remind myself, I was, I was down about 30 minutes, until I realized that virtually everything that shows up in my life has been a blessing, virtually everything. The, all of the struggles, whether it's in, you know, addictions, or whether it's in living in foster homes and being aband, whether it's my wife and I separating and the pain of that, whatever it might be. A dear friend of mine was Elisabeth Kubler-Ross. She passed away a few years back, and she was the one who wrote so much about death and dying. She had a wonderful and important message for us. She said, if you shield the mountain from the windstorms, you'll never see the beauty of the carvings. And the beauty of the carvings comes from being able to be in a state of gratitude for the storms that show up in our life, just as much as the things that we would like to have show up in our life. You have to start retraining your subconscious mind, and your subconscious mind, it responds to what it is that you suggest to it. Now, the intriguing thing about your subconscious mind, your habitual mind, is that it can't make a distinction between what it is that you are feeling as a result of what you have placed into your imagination and assumed the feeling of it, and what you are experiencing every day in your life. If you tell, if you go around feeling unhappy, depressed, miserable, sad, whatever, if you, your subconscious mind says, oh, so this is what it is that you would like to attract into your life, and the universal subconscious mind, to which we were all connected, that we call the creative source of the universe, the divine mind, God, the Tao, whatever you might want it to be, that it will begin to offer you experiences that match up to what it is that you are feeling, so your body responds to what it is you place into your subconscious mind. You have to retrain it, because 53 years later, here I am, dit dah-di-di-dah di-dit dah. It's like, it's there, but that's innocuous. That's not, that's not going to hurt anything. But if I've programmed into my subconscious mind feelings of, poor me, I can't do anything about my life, other people are responsible for the reason why I can't get myself happy and healthy and, and so on, if I, if I live with that kind of consciousness within me, you're going around feeling it all the time. Your feelings, your feelings create the destiny that you want. If this assumption is persisted in until it becomes your dominant feeling, the attainment of your ideal is absolutely inevitable. And what's the paramount feeling that you want to have? The feeling of, exactly, the feeling of love. Love is the feeling you must assume. This is the message that Anita brought to me and brought to all of you, that when you place a feeling of love, which is all there is, it seemed to me, on the other side. Is that right, Anita? I mean, ust, it's just nothing. She tries to describe this, and I'm pushing her. Here, I'm 71, I'm cramming for my finals, I mean, I want to know, what's it like over there? You know, we all want to know that. And all she says is, it's just pure love. It's just, it's a love that you are bathed in, if you will. Bathe yourself in that kind of love. Live from that place and know God is love. The fourth Wishes Fulfilled foundation I call attention. This is really crucial. Your imagination is able to do all that you ask in proportion to the degree of your attention. So what kind of attention do you place on your desires? Let's say, well, I'll give you an example, the one of, of myself, with this business of this chronic lymphocytic leukemia. My kids just got me this wonderful gift. I hadn't had it before. They wanted me in the 21st century. It's called an ipad. I just got, I just got my first e-mail address, and I'm not telling anybody what it is, because. So, but it's just this wonderful, they've got this nderful feature that I really think we should have in life, and it's called trash. Which I had never seen before. They were explaining this to me. So anything that comes in that you don't want, you just push this little button, and it's just like this. And it goes like this, whoop. It actually moves, and you can, and it makes a little sound, whoop. And then there's a little button over on this side that says delete. You know? So it's something you put into the trash, and then you hit delete, it's gone forever. That's the kind of way you want to use your attention. There are two kinds of attention, according to Neville, the subjective attention and objective attention. Subjective attention is different from objective attention. You want to use ubjective attention, not objective attention. Neville says, there's an enormous difference between attention directed objectively and attention directed subjectively, and the capacity to change your future depends on the latter. Whatev have placed into your imagination, you always go to your reality and call that which does not exist as if it did. I am. And you, I have a rule about it, it's don't complain and don't explain. You don't have to explain what you have placed into your imagination. It is totally yours. One of my great teachers in my life, in my early doctoral years, was Dr. Abraham Maslow. He said, become independent of the good opinion of other people. Trust yourself, subjective attention. You, and only you, capital Y-O-U, are the subject that impacts the burning desire in your imagination. ! You are living and feeling as if your future dreams are a present fact. Objective attention, you become the objectified result of other people telling you what you can't do, what's impossible, and so on. Subjective attention, mine is mine. I have an image that I use. I call it the superglue method. And when I have an intention about what it is, including doing this program, when I have an intention about making this program a reality, and it involves a lot of money and a lot of, a lot of expense, a lot of people, a lot of things have to come together. It involves going over into my writing space every single day, never giving up on it. For even if I d't feel like writing, four or five hours every single day, because I superglue, I superglue my intention into my imagination, and I don't allow anybody else's opinions to do anything to distract from that. I don't care if they tell me I can't do it, or if it's impossible, or it'll cost too much, that we can't do. My intentions are superglued there, and I have that do-not-disturb sign placed on my imagination, and it is mine. Use this. Don't allow anybody else's opinions, don't allow what it says on the Internet, don't allow the research, don't allow what anybody out there tells you is possible or not possible for you.

Wayne Dyer: Hello, I'm wayne dyer and I've always said and I believe that PBS is a national treasure to be cherished. The programs you see here nurture our minds and our souls and I hope you agree with me that they deserve our support. I'm so proud to have my programs produced and aired by PBS. Please, support this public television station with your contribution. Thank you and God bless you. 
Narrator: There are beautiful thank you gifts awaiting when you make a donation to this station now by phone or on our secure website. 
BaBette Davidson: Hello, I'm babette davidson. We're taking another brief intermission, we are here with Dr. Wayne Dyer. And I have to tell you, I have been watching the program and taking notes. 
Wanye: I know, I've watched you. 
BaBette Davidson: I have so many a-ha moments, I need to watch this over and over again. It's so much information. 
Wayne Dyer: That's very important what you're saying there that you know, you watch the show and you see something that hits you and you say oh my gosh that's right and you're thinking about it, the same with listening to a CD then meantime the show is still going on and all of this that's going on over here is you're not registering. The next time you plug it in you're seeing something different. That's why when you watch the show, you can almost say, there's something new in it every time because it didn't register into your subconscious mind before that. 
BaBette Davidson: Well, here some, this is my a-ha for this, this past segment. It's the dot-dot-dot-dot-dot-dot, it's that subconscious. 
Wayne Dyer: Right. 
Batte Davidson: It's the, I want to make change, and I stop myself. And it's I'm not making the changes I need to, to reach my destiny. 
Wayne Dyer: That was a,a, a, by the way, dot-dot-dot-dot-dot-dot just in case. 
BaBette Davidson: I just picked that up subconsciously. 
Wayne Dyer: Just in case you want to know. Let me talk to you a little big about the big banana and we got the big banana right here. I love that, the big banana that's what they call things in Maui, where I do my writing. And what we've put together is a multimedia library really and this multi, because everybody learns in different ways, but we've got two books in there, two very powerful books. One is a book that I've written called "Wishes Fulfilled" which is filled with specifics about how to attract into your life and manifest, become the kind of manifester that this whole program is about but it's very specific. The end of every chapter there are suggestions on how to go about doing it and then there's this book. This book is called "Dying to be Me." This is one of the most profound teachings that I've ever had in my life. My mom is gonna be 96 years old on her next birthday. She's in an assisted living center down in Orlando and just a, just a wonderful, beautiful, profound lady whose had a very tough way to go in many ways. 

[01:58:15]


BaBette Davidson: Right. 
Wayne Dyer: In her life and has overcome all of it. She lives with death, because when you're, a lot of people in their 90s, she'll go to sleep one night and the person that they had breakfast with isn't there any longer and so I sent her a "Dying to be Me" Anita's book. All I can tell you is my mother has not had one moment that isn't peaceful since, since that time. She said Wayne, I've never ever read anything that just put me so at ease. The same with Lina that said in the previous break about her, about her mom. But my mom is still here and she said, she's also said, "would you please send me some of these for some of the other people here because all they ever talk about is what's wrong, or how fearful they are, or how scared. And what she's saying is obviously there is nothing to be afraid of, if there's that kind of love on the other side. 
BaBette Davidson: So how wonderful that she can replace in her subconscious. She was able to change that talk because that's as we get older, that's what happens. We, I don't feel well, I've got to go to the doctor, this is what is happening to me. 
Wayne Dyer: Poor me, always thinking about how sick I am until. We also have in this, in the big banana the DVD of the entire show with the additional bonus material and this additional bonus material is very relevant because it's almost an hour, it's almost a full hour and it's my interviewing further and much more detail, ch more frankly Anita, in telling her story in depth and also I tell the story of my healing with John of God which was a very, very profound experience for me. It was the kind of thing, that I was kind of skeptical about somebody being able to do that and all I can say it was miraculous for me and I met him in person up in New York just recently and he looked at me and he said, "You are well" and I just, I still carry that. 
BaBette Davidson: Oh, very powerful. And the other thing that's on that bonus material is a story about you and some shoes. 
Wayne Dyer: Yes. 
BaBette Davidson: I love that you share all parts of your life. 
Wayne Dyer: Absolutely. 
BaBette Davidson: The good and the bad. 
Wayne Dyer: I didn't wanna, I didn't wanna wear shoes and my producer Niki Vettel whose been my producer for, this is the 9th time, so we're doing something together but she's always telling me what to do. She's like this little control freak you know. Do this, do that, wear this, wear that. She's always right you know and I love her dearly ok but I didn't, I wanted to just wear my Birkenstocks which is what I live in in Maui and she said, "You gotta wear shoes." I said, "You can't tell me what to do, I'm not wearing shoes you know." 

[02:00:34]


BaBette Davidson: And she did and you had a remarkable experience. 
Wayne Dyer: Before I had children I had 8 theories about how to raise children, now I have 8 children, no theories. 
BaBette Davidson: No theories. 
Wayne Dyer: But one thing I know for certain, nobody likes being told what to do. But she was right and I went, and I told the story, I went and bought the shoes because at the last moment I just decided well, that's probably the thing that I should do and she's always right and I went and on the way back from bringing the shoes, there was a homeless man walking across the street, his name was Ken he was from Boston and I escorted him across so he didn't get hit by the traffic took him over to a restaurant and sat him down, got a waitress and said would you please get him some soup and a sandwich and gave him some money to take and none of that would have happened had Niki and I. I tell that whole story anyway. 
BaBette Davidson: It's a wonderful story. 
Wayne Dyer: That's on the bonus material as well. We also have "Experiencing the Miraculous." Which is my invitation to you to visit with me the most venerated spiritual places on the planet. Three of them, Assisi where St. Francis lived back in the thirteenth century. I've written an entire book about his life and how it impacted me and also in Lourdes and also in Medagorje. And I gave lectures in these places where I just, all I could say is you'll never see these lectures any place else. Alright? Because I don't even know that I could ever repeat them. Something just entered my body and took it over. 
BaBette Davidson: A time and a moment. 
Wayne Dyer: Absolutely. 
BaBette Davidson: Very special. 
Wayne Dyer: So we show all of the footage of all of these beautiful places but I also give these lectures that it's the only place you're going to hear them so that's with me as well. If you've always had a wish to go to tse places and instead, you couldn't do it, you couldn't afford it or you don't have the time, then we're going to fulfill that wish. "Experiencing the Miraculous", every bit of it is on there. And then there is this miraculous CD, meditation 
it's called the "I Am: Wishes Fulfilled Meditation." Through the magic of science, how they do it I have no idea, they've been able to go back and take the letters in the original Hebrew alphabet that God speaking to Moses would have been, and create the sounds that correspond to those letters and create the tuning fork, and with that tuning fork they create a sound and with that sound they have an accompaniment of this beautiful music that goes with it. All I can say is when I ask my children to do it with me, they go oh dad, you are always wanting us to do something crazy and I put it on and say just meditate with me for 20 minutes. Just do it, and I put it on that sound, the sound of the, I just think of it as the sound of creation and everyday now they ask me can we do it again dad, can we do it again dad? 

[02:03:04]


BaBette Davidson: Don't you love that, wayne? Because now all of a sudden they say, "Dad's always right." 
Wayne Dyer: Right. 
BaBette Davidson: So somebody's always right. 
Wayne Dyer: Well, they always say that anyway. 
BaBette Davidson: Well let me tell you what's always right. The people who watch PBS and support this station, you're always right. You let us know what you appreciate, what you want to see and you have helped keep Dr. Wayne Dyer on PBS for these nine wonderful programs. 
Wayne Dyer: I love you there you go, I want you to have a banana, you know? 
BaBette Davidson: You're the big banana. They're the big banana. 
Wayne Dyer: That's right you are. 
BaBette Davidson: Because it's your financial support that makes programs like this possible. Thank you so much for sharing yourself. Thank you so much for sharing of your financial support. 
Wayne Dyer: It's about 80 cents a day for public television to receive, 80 cents a day to support this station that is so powerful and important You know why it's important? It's important because it brings a different kind of energy into your homes. On cable and commercial television, you'll see thousands and thousands of people being shattered and killed and all of this horrible. You don't see that on public television. You see something that nourishes the soul. That's what this program is about. 
BaBette Davidson: So do something to nourish your soul right now and make that call.

Lina Heil: I thought it would be interesting to see what kind of synonyms the thesaurus has for the word "pledge," and this is what came up: a promise, as in hold out an expectation, or chip in. Or give one's fair share. And checking out the word "commitment," I saw heading such as resolution, dedication, unselfishness, and cause.

BaBette Davidson: Wayne, in the last segment you quoted Neville, who said that, "A change of feeling is a change of destiny." How does that work in real life? 
Wayne Dyer: Well, I can give you a perfect example of it. When I was told that I had this leukemia, I started to feel sick, I started to feel bad. I started to change around. I started to believe that there were restrictions that I had to do and I just really decided that I was going to change the way, 'cause when you change the way you look at things, the things you look at change. I began to go within and change my feeling, and begin, instead of thinking that I hope I get well some day and I hope I can overcome this thing, I began to say I feel fine. I feel terrific, a lot of people don't do that. I have a wonderful story that I told of a friend of mine who was out in the workout room and where I go down to work and he's in there and he's got snoopies coming out of his nose and he's just all like this and I said, "Lou, what's going on?" I said, "How long have you had this thing you know?" He said in three weeks, it will be a month. I said who thinks like this! I mean, what do you mean in three, you're going to care three more weeks instead of feeling that you know, I am well, I'm being able to say it and can carry it around in your mind. 
BaBette Davidson: Thinks that way, sometimes I do, that's why I need you, that's why I hope that you feel appreciated and loved when you hear those phones ring. 

[02:08:39]


Wayne Dyer: I do, I love to hear the phones ring. 
BaBette Davidson: It's people like me saying, "We aciate you, we love you." 
Wayne Dyer: Right, thank you. 
BaBette Davidson: So I hope you are making that call to let Wayne know how much you appreciate it. Whether you are. 
Wayne Dyer: Big banana. 
BaBette Davidson: The big banana. You are the big banana when you make that call. You make these things possible and whether it's the book at the $50 level or the whole banana at the $275. One thing we haven't talked about that I love is that at that $275 pledge. 
Wayne Dyer: Right. 
BaBette Davidson: Everybody's gonna get a free download of the show. 
Wayne Dyer: So they get the show instantly. 
BaBette Davidson: Absolutely. 
Wayne Dyer: If they do it by credit card. 
BaBette Davidson: And which is wonderful because like I said there is so much in this that you're gonna want to hear over and over again. 
Wayne Dyer: Right, right. Absolutely. 
BaBette Davidson: And more coming in the show. We've talked a little bit about the 6-CD set from Maui. 
Wayne Dyer: It's a seminar. People pay hundreds and hundreds of dollars have to get on a plane. Fly all the way to Maui, we spend an entire weekend. Here we're getting it in a couple of hours, there it's all day Saturday, all day Sunday, all of it recorded, all of it is put out there. It's all live, it's all exciting, it's all compelling. That's just a part of it including the "Experiencing the Miraculous" and the CD and the two hardcover books which. 
BaBette Davidson: So much. Well thank you again for sharing and choosing those thank you gifts to help us reach our higher selves. We hope you are making that call right now. Lina is here again to encourage you to go to the phone. 
Lina Heil: That's right babette. If you're like many of our viewers, you look for an appreciate quality in all areas of your life and that includes television programs and stations you watch. You look forward to new ideas, whether it's about politics, on the world stage or how to make a great new lasagna or maybe even a banana souffl??. You wanna relax certainly but not to be talked down to. This station has a full menu of activities that go well beyond what you are seeing on the screen. Outreach programs, that expand on the content of many, many programs. Special projects for teachers and students to connect them to world class resources. We understand that in this day and age you're making very careful choices about what you support with your own resources. We hope that you'll choose this station as a recipient of a charitable contribution. Call the number on your screen, talk to one of our great volunteers and decide on a thank you gift if you'd like. But call now. We trust that you'll do the right thing. 

[02:10:57]


Narrator: We deeply appreciate your contribution at any level that's comfortable for you. What is important is your support. Thank you. 
BaBette Davidson: We were talking about you straddling the old and the new and people were so tickled that your kids got you the ipad and do you feel more connected to the world because of that or does it point you down a new street? 
Wayne Dyer: The truth of it is, babette, I feel connected to my source and it's the most important relationship that I have. It's just my continuous reminder that who I am is divine and that each and every one of you out there watching is divine. That's what I, you know whether you call it prayer, whether you call it meditation, whatever, it's just a knowing that I'm not just body, I'm connected to something that is eternal. It's birthless, it's deathless, it's changeless. We're going to go to the 

[02:13:58]


Dr. Dyer: Thank you. Thank you. I just want to reemphasize that this really works. I mean, it really does work if you just put in the minimal effort that I've been speaking about, about realizing how powerful your imagination is and assuming the feeling of what it is you want to be, as if it already were your reality. A change of feeling is a change of destiny. The fifth foundation, before I go to it, you may have noticed my little hat here, right? How about that? I just took a group of people to Assisi, Lourdes, and Medjugorje, three great spiritual places where miracles have taken place. And I got one of these hats, and I don't think I've taken it off since. It's my w uniform. The fifth foundation, the Wishes Fulfilled foundation, I call it now I lay me down to sleep. And it is about the most practical of all of the five Wishes Fulfilled foundations. This is something that you can do when the show is over tonight, when you go to bed. In the Book of Job, there is a very important statement. The statement says, in a dream, in a vision of the night, when deep sleep falls upon men while slumbering in their beds, then he opens the ears of men and seals their instruction. Your subconsciound is most comfortable when you are unconscious. You are unconscious when you are in your sleep state. And in your sleep state, your subconscious mind is busy at work. And it's so important, these, I call it the last five minutes of your day. So you get into bed, every day you get into bed, it's, you get ready to go to sleep, and you are now about to, you're in that state between being awake and being asleep, where you're getting drowsy and, and you e going to marinate for the next eight hours in your unconscious subconscious mind. You are preparing your marinade. And the question is, how do you want to prepare yourself for having your instructions sealed? Your ears are opened, and your instructions are sealed. So, most people use the last five minutes of their day, as they're about to enter into sleep, to review all of the things that they don't like, and all of the things that didn't work, and all of the people that hurt their feelings, and all of the stuff that is going on in their life that they wish weren't happening. This is their worry time. This is the time when you fill your mind with all of this stuff, and then you go off into sleep and he opens your ears and seals your instructions while you are slumbering. That's right out of the Book of Job. So what you want to do is reverse this practice, because your subconscious mind is listening to how you are asking the universe to provide for you what it is that you would like to attract or manifest into your life. And if you fill your subconscious mind with all of the things that you don't want, that you don't like, that make you unhappy, that make you depressed, that make you worry, then your subconscious mind, which is impersonal, and remember, it can't make a distinction between what it is that you are feeling as a result of what you place into your mind or what is actually happening in your life. It doesn't distinguish one from the other. It's totally impersonal. It's just open to suggestion. And here you are, suggesting to your subconscious mind, which will, when you awaken, you will align with the universal subconscious mind, the one mind, you know, there's millions of people out there in the world, there's millions of you watching this program, and you can see the difference between each and every one of you on the basis of your appearances, but there's only one mind. That's what the great spiritual texts all teach us. So now, if you, if you program your subconscious mind to tell your, to go over all the things you don't want, all the things you don't like, all the things that shouldn't have happened, all the ways that you were mistreated, all about how terrible the economy is, and you know, we live in a fear-based world. You want to shift away from that kind of consciousness and use the last five minutes of your, of your day to program your subconscious mind with what you have placed into your imagination with your I ams. I am well. I say it to myself every night, especially when I get into that, that state, you know, that weird state, where you're sort of half awake and you're half asleep and you know you're heading towards that, sort of that subconscious place, and I just remember what it says in the Book of Job. I don't want my instructions sealed by going over, I am sick, I am poor, I am unhappy. I just say, I am content, I am lucky. When I wake up in the morning, I don't say, oh, good God, morning. It's the reverse. I say, good morning, God. You know, it's like, being grateful rather than being in that place where the things that you don't want are what you have programmed your life to be. I always think of this as, you know, like you have a currency, and, and if I were to give you currency to go out and purchase what you, what you want, and every place you went you took this currency that you have to purchase what you want and you purchase what you don't want, and then when you get home and you wonder why your house and your life is filled with everything that you don't want, it's because you're insane. That's just insanity. It is. I mean, why would you take what, the currency that you have to buy what you do, that, that's there for what you do want and spend it on what you don't want? When the currency that you have for attracting into your life what you would like to have are your thoughts and your imagination and your, and your I ams, your God-consciousness, why would you use it to say, I am unable, I am unlucky, I cannot, I will not? You're throttling, that's what it says in the "I Am" Discourses, you're throttling that great I-am presence that is located within you. And so, the last five minutes of your day, as you're about to marinate for eight hours in your subconscious mind, with your unconscious state, you want to go into that state, even if you just, even if your senses tell you, oh, this is, well, you're just fooling yourself and so on. You don't want to use your senses and the Internet and other people's opinions, what you see, what you hear. You want to let go of all oat anything that you want to attract or create for yourself in your life begins with what you have placed in your imagination and have assumed the feeling of that wish fulfilled, and now you're going to practice it, because you want, I've been trying to get, I mean, getting stuff out of your subconscious mind is a big job. It really is. People, most people are just not willing to do what it takes. I still can't get the Morse code out of my subconscious mind. I need to have a major deprogramming thing. There's that exit sign, di-dah-dah-dah-dah, di-di-dah, it's always there. But that's just harmless. What isn't harmless is, you know, placing into your subconscious mind all the things that you're reviewing about what you don't like, about what didn't happen, about who mistreated you, about how sad you are, about how this can't happen. You are a creator. Neville put it this way. He said, the feeling, which comes in response to the question, how would I feel were my wish realized, is the feeling which will monopolize and mobilize your attention as you relax into sleep. How would I feel were what it is that I would like to attract and create, and I don't care what it is, whether it's about the, the, the condition of your body, the disease state that you're in, the fact that you've been overweight for, for three centuries or three decades or whatever it is the fact that you've been addicted, you ignore it, even if you're drinking the coffee and doing the drugs and, and, and drinking alcohol or eating the sugar and so on. Ignore what your senses tell you. Ignore what, what you see on the scale. Ignore all of that, and say, I am sober, I am healthy, I am well-being, I am content, I am happy, I am perfect health, because ultimately, that's how you will attract it. already in advance and call those things which do not yet exist as though they do. Now, as I get ready to conclude this program of love, there are two really significant things. You've gone to sleep. You've programmed your subconscious mind. And I want every one of you, every one of you watching this show, I want you, when you get into bed tonight, just try it tonight, instead of using these five minutes to review what you don't want, review everything that you've placed into your imagination. And keep this in mind. When people say to me, and they say it to me all the time, what if I do everything that you say and it doesn't work? It just doesn't work. The student should constantly remind yourself, if it doesn't feel natural, if it doesn't feel natural, it isn't going to work, okay? Now I was being interviewed on a national television show by a guy who is about five-foot-seven and weighed mbe 140 pounds, and he did this long, intensive interview with me, and he said, you mean to tell me that if I do everything that you say, that I can become a linebacker for the New York Giants professional football team, because he lived in New York? And I said, does it feel natural for you to be a linebacker for the New York Giants? Does that feel natural to you? And he said, no, it doesn't. And if it just doesn't feel natural to you, then all of the rest of this is a waste of your energy. Now the question isn't whether you're going to become a linebacker on a professional football team, but does it feel natural for you to say, I deserve prosperity? Does it feel natural for you to say, I deserve to be in a state of well-being, I deserve for my body to weigh exactly what I want it to weigh, what it is supposed to weigh? Does it feel natural for you to say, I am beautiful, I am strong, I am capable, I am loved? If it doesn't feel natural, you've got a real problem going with your subconscious mind. You've got a Morse code in there, di-di-di-di, I am fat, di-di-di-dit, I am poor, dah-dah-dah-di, I am unable. You have to start reprogrammingour subconscious mind to say, I came from a place of well-being, I came from a place of perfect health, I came from a place of love, and I am well-being, I am wealth. Now on the other hand, there are some people, like there's a basketball player out there in the NBA, his name is Muggsy Bogues. Muggsy Bogues is about two-foot-three. No, he's about five-foot-seven or five-foot-eight, and he can dunk a basketball. He's five-foot-seven and he can dunk a basketball. I'm six-foot-two, I can hardly see the rim. But somehow, for this man who is five-foot-seven, it felt natural for him to be able to elevate his body and grab onto a rim that's 10 feet off of the ground, and it feels natural for him and he's able to do it. And there are so many examples of people who have accomplished things that they have never had a belief system that it was impossible for them. So for every single one of us, the intention needs to be, it feels natural to me, even if I don't know how to do it, even if I have no experience with it, even if it's something that everybody else has told me isn't, I can't do, you need to be able to say to yourself, yes, I feel natural being happy, being loved, being prosperous, being all the things that I placed into my imagination. The second thing that I'd like to say in conclusion is that, I was trying to manifest something into my life, and I did everything, but it still wasn't working. And then I re-read the "I Am" Discourses, and one of the things that it says in the "I Am" Discourses that is very, very powerful is that, as long as you are having any thoughts of condemnation, criticism or judgment towards any of God's children, you are throttling the great I-am presence within you that is God. And I realized that my attempt to manifeswhat I wanted for myself into my life involved some judgment, some criticism, and even some condemnation toward someone who had done things that I felt that that person shouldn't have done. And when I let go of the judgment, and I let go of the condemnation, and I let go of the criticism, almost instantly what it was that I was looking to manifest showed up in my life. You can't have any thoughts towards any of God's children that involve criticism, judgment or condemnation. We are all just doing what we know how to do, and we can't ask any more of anyone. Those of you who have followed me over the years know that one of my very favorite songs is Amazing Grace. It's a very powerful song. We have to walk down a new street. There it is, a new street, and not just for ourselves but for the planet and for our children. There's a wonderful prayer that the Native Americans would say. When we walk upon the Earth, we place our feet very carefully because we know that the faces of our future generations are looking up at us from beneath the ground, and we never forget them. Sometimes I think we have forgotten them. Sometimes I think we forget that we are borrowing our planet from them. This is theirs, and they're just letting us use it. This, on this stage with me, I'm proud to say, is the San Diego Children's Choir. And I would like to tell all of you, ladies and gentlemen, the story about the song you're about to sing. This song was composed by a man named John Newton, who lived back in the 18th century. And he was in the business of selling human beings into slavery. He was 22 years old and he was a slave-ship captain. And in this hideous practice that was so commonplace in the 17th and 18th centuries in the British and American Empires, he was taking people from West Africa on his ship to the New World, to South Carolina, to be sold into slavery. And halfway across the ocean, he encountered a storm, and he heard, from the wailing of one of the people that was to be sold into slavery, the sounds, and he took out an envelope and he wrote on the back of this envelope the words to a song, I once was lost and now I'm found. I once walked down an old street, and I'm walking now on a new street. And in one moment, his life was changed. And the storm passed, and legend tells us that he turned his ship around and he went back to Africa, and he released all of the people who were still alive, and then he took his ship to a place in England, called Bristol, and gave up being a slave-ship captain and became the most ardent spokesman for the abolition of slavery and was almost single-handedly responsible for ending this horrible, nefarious, hideous practice of selling human beings. And it all happened in one moment, one instant, one quantum moment. Any of us can change our lives in one moment and reverse the old street and begin walking on a new street. So the San Diego Children's Choir, we're so proud to have you come out here and conclude this program on Wishes Fulfilled, and they're going to sing for you Amazing Grace. 

[02:33:45]


San Diego Children's Choir: ??????Amazing grace, how sweet the sound, That saved a wretch like me. I once was lost but now am found, Was blind, but now I see. T'was Grace that taught my heart to fear. And Grace, my fears relieved. How precious did that Grace appear The hour I first believed. Through many dangers, toils and snares I have already come; 'Tis Grace that brought me safe thus far and Grace will lead me home.?????? 

[02:36:21]


[Applause] 
Dr. Dyer: So beautiful, so beautiful, so beautiful, thank you. Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, sweetheart. Thank you, thank you. You're so betiful. Thank you. Wow. They're here, and we thank you for letting us use this planet. And we hope that we will remember you in all that we undertake, in all that we do. If you would like to accomplish something, you must first expect it from yourself. Every one of you, you are a spark that can grow until you recognize that you truly are divine beings, because at every moment of your life, and every moment of your lives, you have this choice. You can either be a host to God or a hostage to your ego. It's your call. God bless you, and God bless you. Thank you. Thank you. 
[Applause] 
Wayne Dyer: I am so proud to have this program produced for and aired on PBS. I believe that television is perhaps the most powerful force in our modern world and that we must and we can create positive and inspiring moments together for the world to see. Personally, I've supported public television for almost all of my entire adult life. The beautiful music specials like Les Misand Andrea Bocelli are as nutritious for my soul as anything else that I put into my body. I want to ask you to support this station. Public television is positive eney. It's creative energy, we need it. Our children need it, our planet needs it, so please go to your phone and call the number on your screen. Be as generous as possible and thank you. Thank you and God bless you, I appreciate it. 

[02:38:58]


BaBette Davidson: Well I want to say thank you and God bless you for all that you give us. I am still a little verklemptfrom all of those children. I love that song, was a favorite of my father's. 
Wayne Dyer: Right. 
BaBette Davidson: But I alove the story behind it. And thank you for putting together such a wonderful stage of people, Anita, the Children's Choir, the stories that you share. If you have appreciated this, this is your last opportunity, the show is now over, you've watched it and if you've thought about this and the thank you gifts and how you might share them with the people that you love, now is the time to make that call. I love your focus on children. You always talk about your 8. I only have 4, I wasn't quite as busy as you but I have. 
Wayne Dyer: It was all my pleasure. It was very easy. 
BaBette Davidson: I have two grandchildren and I agree with you. We are, we are keeping this planet for them and trying to create a world where these children have happy, healthy lives without the de-dit-de-dit-dot-dot. We want them to grow up strong. 
Wayne Dyer: And we're also all children ourselves. There's a child inside each and every one of us and we need to nurture that child as well. There's an innocent, invisible you know child that is endless and that is our spirit. And that spirit of ours just wants to expand, it wants to grow and no place on television provides for expansion more than public television. 
BaBette Davidson: That is absolutely right so we've also, we've talked about this it's the big banana. 
Wayne Dyer: It's the big banana. 
BaBette Davidson: So let's one more time, let's walk through the big banana. 
Wayne Dyer: I want you to think about this because this is truly a multimedia library. That I have put together with the cooperation of Hay House who was always been so cooperative in putting these wonderful programs and bringing thesgifts to you. We have a, I think it's probably the finest program of gifts that we've ever, that we've ever given for a $275 contribution. It's just amazing. 
BaBette Davidson: And it's actually quite heavy so I am going t I am going to assist you. 

[02:40:58]


Wayne Dyer: Ok, first is a brand new hardcover book called "Wishes Fulfilled: Mastering the Art of Manifestation." This is a book I spent about a year and a half of my life every day and I've talked in the program a little bit about it, how this book got written every single day in the afternoon before I would have about four hours I would go to my office space and I would sit there and force myself to write it and there were days when it would just come through me and I was always there every single day and at the end I really feel that, I always say I don't write the books, our source is the writer of all books. 
BaBette Davidson: Wow. 
Wayne Dyer: That book is a part of it. 
BaBette Davidson: And, I love the steps at the end; it's action steps in there. 
Wayne Dyer: That's right, and all of that. I just think all writing is channeled. It all comes from who knows where, just like the words coming out of our mouths right now. Who knows, we don't own any of this. 
BaBette Davidson: That's right. 
Wayne Dyer: We also have the dvd of the entire show along with the additional almost a full hour of bonuaterial. 
BaBette Davidson: Which is unheard of. An hour of bonus material. 
Wayne Dyer: And the bonus material is, if you saw Anita Moorjani, in the show it's a very extended interview with her. It's my entire story, telling you the miraculous thing that happened with me and the healing that resulted as a result of my experience with John of God inAbadiania, in Brazil and then meeting him in New York. So all of that is on this DVD, of the entire show. We also have a second book, it's called "Dying to be 
Me: My journey from cancer tor death and to True Healing." This is a woman who was being wheeled into an emergency room weighing between 85 and 86 pounds. She had been told these were her last hours and her husband was there, her mother was there whispering in her ear, they were waiting for her to take her last breath and rather than that, she watched the entire process take place and had an amazing encounter. All I can think of it is an amazing encounter with her source, with her divineness and she came back to teach 
us one important lesson: Treasure your magnificence and understand that it's all about love. That's what's on the other side. 

[02:43:01]


BaBette Davidson: And living fearlessly. 
Wayne Dyer: Yes, and live fearlessly. And that's a part of this as well. It's a brand new book. We also have the, a seminar which is, we held on Maui. It's a two-day seminar with 6 CDs in it. It's very entertaining, very powerful information. Like I say this program was a couple of hours long this is a couple of days long. 
BaBette Davidson: That's right. 
Wayne Dyer: And you'll have every bit in there. 
BaBette Davidson: And of course it's compelling and entertaining, it's you! 
Wayne Dyer: It is, well thank you very much. And then the thing that I am just so proud of and just so happy that we were able to do, before I gathered all of these people, we gathered 162 people from all continents, people from, who were teenagers, people in their 80s and all in between, male and female, people of all persuasions it was St. Francis' wish to bring the whole world together, that's what we did on this trip. It was sort of a microcosm of the whole world and I gave lectures in Assisi, at one of the most beautiful churches I've ever been in. It was built in the 10th century which is three years, 300 years before the death of St. Francis. He had actually been in that church and at the end of that lecture, something overtook my body that had never happened before in my life and that's all on there along with. 
BaBette Davidson: And I cannot wait to see this. 
Wayne Dyer: Along with the lecture in lourdes and Medjugorje as well. And those lectures by the way, you'll never hear anywhere else. And then I also, the "I Am Wishes Fulfilled Meditation" with the sound that is the equivalent to the sound of the words "I am that I am," spoken by God to Moses as reported in the book of Exodus. All of that for a contribution of two, here, let me help you hold those up. And here, we have to put some bananas on there. 
BaBette Davidson: Oh no. 
Wayne Dyer: There we go. 
BaBette Davidson: Well let me, let me tell you something. I know and have known Wayne for a long time, since you've started working in public television. He chooses these very carefully to help us reach our goals. Help this station reach its oal by calling whether it's for a thank you gift or just to say thank you to Wayne. And right now Lina is going to tell you a bit more about how you can make a difference at this station. 

[02:45:04]


Lina Heil: I think you'll agree that this program has been an exceptional viewing experience. And now I know what to do whenever the work day hasn gone well, or there's hassles in my life or it's just all over whelming. I am going to cue the DVD up of this show right to the San Diego Children's Choir singing "Amazing Grace." That will recharge me and calm me all at the same time. PBS is the only station that brings you programs with Dr. Wayne Dyer. This show has combined philosophy, poetry, comedy, inspiration, spiritual text, and provocative ideas. Where else could you possibly find that combination? Maybe one of your subconscious habits has been to watch this station and ignore requests for support. According to Dr. Dyer, you can make a change. You can start walking down a whole new street by joining with us in our work to bring quality programs to all the people on the streets of your community. It's easy! Call the number on your screen. The volunteer will walk you through the process and you'll feel even better than you're feeling right now. Thank you. 
BaBette Davidson: Absolutely. Thank you, thank you. I am grateful and we do have a speciatreat for you in just a moment but I have used these and I want to ask you. I know you get feedback from people about when they use the books and the CDs. People's lives really are changed. You must be overwhelmed by the positive feedback you get. Wayne Dye I can't even go outdoors anymore because it's always someone who says, I saw it on public television and it's interesting because when you put a program like this together, it seems like it just all flows and it's all just easy. I think I gave 10 or 12 four hour lectures in all different cities all over the world actually in preparation for this, this was something I had set myself to do at the end of the year and have it completed and I just feel that we have just created such a beautiful experience of love for people. 
BaBette Davidson: It's a beautiful program. Now, we've seen the entire program. What is it that you hope viewers are going to take away? What do they take away from this program at the end of it? 

[02:47:05]


Wayne Dyer: Well, if you don' take anything else away, take away this. That you're not here as a human being, having a spiritualxperience, it's the reverse of that. You are here as a spiritual being having a temporary human experience. Your essence is your spirit. It is said even in the New Testament, it's the spiri that gives life. The flesh counts for nothing. Understand that you are divine. That you are not just some happenstance thing happening in a happenstance universe. You are part of an organized intelligence. You are here for a reason. Don't end your life dying with your music still in you. You still have something that you came here to play, you have something that you're here to do. This program is designed to help you to realize that you have all the tools that you need within your imagination to place in there what it is that you absolutely intend to manifest. Only you say it, I'm already there, "I am," the two most important words that you can say. I am content. I am happy, I am refusing to be depressed, I am refusing to think of myself as sickly or poor. As it says in the Old Testament, let the weak say I am strong. Say it, live it, practice it. 
BaBette Davidson: Live it, practice it. I am so delighted that you had that Children's Choir in there. Wayne DOh yes, they are so beautiful. 
BaBette Davidson: We had so many people call and say they wanted to see this again so we have a little clip again, a little encore of that beautiful San Diego Children's Choir. We hope you enjoy it and while you are listening to "Amazing Grace," we hope you'll think about what an amazing program this has been and sing out for this station and for Wayne. ?????? Children's Choir: Amazing Grace, How sweet the sound. ?????? ?????? That saved a wretch like me. ?????? ?????? I once was lost, But now I am found. ?????? ?????? Was blind but now I see. ?????? ?????? ?????? ?????? Twas Grace that taught My heart to fear. ?????? ?????? And Grace, my fears relieved. ?????? ?????? How precious did that Grace appear ?????? ?????? The hour I first believed. ??????

Lina Heil: What an honor it was to hear those young voices, just beautiful. I think you'll agree Wayne Dyer is one of our greatest storytellers and his stories alys seem to point us in an enlightening direction. And right now you and I are gathered around the most 
potent storytelling medium in history: television. And specifically, public television. I hope you share our belief that the stories that this public TV station brings you, your family and your entire community are the most inspiring, exciting and best told that you see on TV today. But like any other great storyteller, public TV has to be nourished and that's where you come in. We're taking some time to ask you to make a contribution to this PBS station so that we can continue to tell you stories that will change your life. Please call now. 
Narrator: There are beautiful thank you gifts awaiting when you make a donation to this station now by phone or on our secure website. And if you complete your donation with a credit card, you'll receive the audio download of the program you're watching now with bonus features. 
BaBette Davidson: You kw wayne, I can't get past this because I really wanted to go on that "Experiencing the Miraculous" thing. 
Wayne Dyer: You didn't place it into your imagination strong enough. 
BaBette Davidson: I wanted to go and now I understand, that this is part, it was part of the $275, so I'm going to be able to see it. Once in a lifetime, wonderful, wonderful lectures from you, inspiring, etc., but there was some light moments. 
Wayne Dyer: There were. Yes, well, when we were in Dubrovnik, we had just a powerful, we rented a ship. And we went out, all 162 people from all of the continents from all over the world, went out there with us, and we just had a great time. 
BaBette Davidson: Oh, who is that, wayne? 
Wayne Dyer: That's me doing my dance as well. 
BaBette Davidson: You may want to keep your day job! No, ha ha. 
Wayne Dyer: Nevermind, that's my hula dance. 
BaBette Davidson: I love that! Now, Wayne, you've shown that you can dance, I also know that you can sing. We are at our last few moments and I know there's something traditionally you like to do. 
Wayne Dyer: I always say it's a song that my mother used to sing, when I was a teenager, it was about sitting on the fence. If you've been sitting on that fence and thinking, and I know if you've been watching the show for this entire time or even if you've tuned in late, you've been thinking, well, I don't know, I'm not sure if I can afford it. I'd like to have it, but I'm not, it's called sitting on the fence. And there's an old song that says, ??????"If you've been ?????? sitting on the fence, and it doesn't make much sense, ?????? ?????? 'cause you keep me in suspense, and you know it. ?????? ?????? If you're kind and if you've got a heart, don't ?????? ?????? keep us apart. ?????? ?????? Make up your mind!" ??????

So make the call. And support the public television station that we are all so, feel is so important. It's the most important energy in our country. 
BaBette Davidson: It is! And you know, I love that you called it treasures because I feel like the thank you gifts that you put together they really are treasures. And just one last time on that $275, the big banana, the whole bunch. 
Wayne Dyer: There they are. 
BaBette Davidson: We've got two books, multiple DVDs. 
Wayne Dyer: Six dvds and seven cds. 
BaBette Davidson: Oh my goodness, it's everything. 
Wayne Dyer: Lectures that you'll never hear anyplace else. I'm t

>> What I'm telling you here is that your immune system is the mastermind behind your body's ability to resist disease. Please join us for "dr. Fuhrman's immunity solution." 
(applause) 
>> Thank you. Hi, I'm dr. Fuhrman. I welcome you to dr. Fuhrman's immunity solution. Do you or someone you know have cancer, a relative or a friend maybe? Do you know someone suffering from headaches, allergies, or an autoimmune disease like arthritis? If your answer is yes, this is no coinciden. Our country's in severe health crisis that's tragic, even more tragic because most people don't know these illnesses don't have to be. This show gives a solution to the explosion of illnesses across america, and my goal is to inform you about the new most recent advances in modern nutritional science that can solve many of our nation's most serious health problems-- problems like autoimmune disease, life threatening infections and even cancer. Now I know if there was a wa you ladies could protect yourself against breast cancer, you would, right? If I told you to drink a cup of green tea every day and that would give you 90% protection, wouldn't you do it? 

[03:02:05]


>> Yes. 
>> Of course, you would. It's not as simple as just a cup of green tea, but it is pretty simple, and I'm gonna give you the solution right here in this show. And I know if you men out there knew there was a magic bean you could eat and you would never have to worry about prostate or colon cancer, you'd certainly eat some of those beans, right? 
>> Yeah. 
>> If what I'm claiming is true and you really could protect yourself against cancer, against heart attacks and against dementia in later life, what would that protection be worth to you? Millns, right? 
>> Yes. 
>> Not even, it's priceless, something money can't buy. Well, on this show, I'm gonna give you this lifesaving information, and I'm claiming we can win the war on cancer in america with some simple steps, and I'm going to explain why i think this is so. This is a serious show because I'm talking about some serious problems. But it's very important you pay close attention and learn what I'm going to teach you today. You may even want to take notes. The information may prevent you from years of suffering and pain. It could even save your life. Having a powerful, fully functioning immune system can protect you from breast cancer, from prostate cancer, from colon cancer, from pancreatic cancer. Excluding lung cancer caused by smoking, those are the four most common cancers in america. And that's right, I'm making a radical claim. Here it is. We can win the war on cancer, and we can win it right now. Exactly what do I mean by win the war in cancer? I mean that we can prevent 90% or more of cancer deaths, and the science supporting this is strong, it's logical, and we can't wait any longer to put it into action because not acting is killing people, and not acting could even kill you. Before we review this evidence, I want to state that all the statements here are supported by scientific evidence, and my conclusions are not just the result of one study on any issue, but on many studies. People will try, but this information is impossible to deny. Look, that's fine if you are an informed adult and you want to smoke cigarettes and eat like other americans eat. That's your right. But I think everyone also has the right to at least know they have a choice to know they did not have to get demented with aging, to know they did not have to have that bypass surgery, did not have to have that heart attack and they did not have to get that cancer. Do what you want, but at least do so with your eyes fully opened armed with the right information, so you can choose to take control of your health destiny. This concept that we don't have to get cancer only seems ouageous because we've been misinformed that these diseases are inevitable ogenetic or that we have to be dependent on medical treatments like chemotherapy and invasive surgery. We've been brainwashed to accept that disease is to be expected and that medicines and medical treatments will save us. These most common cancers are a new delopment in human history. They've exploded to these high levels only in the last 50 to 75 years. We can also look at the dietary changes that have occurred i those countries where cancers used to be very low and it became high. The scientific studies are now demonstrating that a normal functioning immune system is dependent on certain foods, and when you eat those foods regularly, you protect yourself from cancer even developing. Vegetable consumption plummeted over the last hundred years in america, and refined or processed foods and sugars increased dramatically as our body weights increased dramatically, too. The standard diet most americans are eating today is simply deadly. Take a look at this graph that shows the increasing incidence of cancer since 1940. Sadly the upward climb in cancer rates is continuing worldwide as those countries now eat like us and refined foods and fast foods have become available all over thrld. But this show is not only about preventing cancer. This is about preventing and reversing autoimmune diseases that have also exploded in recent years. This explosion of autoimmune disease has matched the increased cancer incidents for THE 1940s TO THE 1990s. Let me give you an example of some common autoimmune diseases... And abndred more autoimmune illnesses and related immune system disorders such as asthma, allergies and fibromyalgia. Of course, when we eat a diet style that weakens immune system function, we allow cancer and we create an epidemic of autoimmune diseases from immune system malfunction. Look at the skyrocketing increase in lupus in the last 50 years. Autoimmune illness, where our own immune system attacks us, is now the third leading class of illness in america after hardening of the arteries or arterial sclerosis and cancer. And autoimmune disease has the same nutritional causes as cancer. These diseases are not predominantly genetic. Environmental and nutritional factors simply overwhelm genetics. How could autoimmune disease and the most common cancers be mostly genetic if they were both relatively rare in past generations and in other parts of the world? How could they be mostly genetic if there's so little of these diseases in asia? Yet when the asian popation moves to america and eats our diet style, the same cancers double or triple in one generation. Colorectal cancer risk in chinese immigrants increases with the number of years they live in north america. This exposure to a richer diet with more meat, more oil, more sugar, more refined foods triggers both heart disease and cancer. An asian woman born in the u.S. Will have more than a 60% higher rate of getting breast cancer compared to a woman born in asia. And this instance of breast cancer was more than ten times the instance of breast cancer in asia 50 years ago. Let's look at some of this data in more detail. First, let's look at the death rate from breast cancer in VARIOUS COUNTRIES IN THE 1960s. Note how in 1967, japan, china, dominican republic and even mexico had only about onnth the breast cancer deaths compared to the u.S. And northern europe. Now let's go from 1967 and look at breast cancer incidence in korea in 1988. Wow, still only one-tenth the rate we see in america at that time. Fascinating. Now let's go from 1988 to 2008. Just 20 years later, and breast cancer incidence quadrupled in korea over that time frame. What do you think happened to the korean diet just a few years before this radical explosion of breast cancer? Well, let's take a look. Now do you see how their diet changed? Wow, animal products and sugar consumption more than doubled, and the consption of oils are now eight times as high as they were in 1978. What do animal products, oils, and refined foods like sweeters have in common to promote cancer? Well, they're all foods that do not contain anticancer antioxidants and phytochemicals, and they're foods that raise cancer promoting hormones. Whatpened was the diet was becoming more americanized like in other parts of the world, and as the diet becomes more like ours, cancer rates become more like ours, too. Let's take a look at the american diet because it's perfectly designed to cause cancer and heart disease. It's not only sad--it is sad. It's s.A.D., The standard americt, s.A.D. It's very sad because it's deadly. So take a look at this pie chart of what americans are eating. That's about 26% of calories from animal products and over 60% of calories from refined foods such as oil, white bread, sweets, candies, fast foods, chips, and soda. Not only do refined and processed foods not contain those antioxidants and phytochemicals that fight cancer, but they're high glycemic foods that raise sugar in the bloodstream, spiking your insulin levels, and insulin is a hormone that is cancer promoting in excess. More flour, white rice, sugar means more insulin and more cancer. And as the animal products increased from small amounts in the diet to larger amounts, cancer rates have been shown to increase as well. This is not a questionable finding. Animal products are similar to refined processed foods in that they also do not contain antioxidants and phytochemicals. And the more of them you eat, the more fruits and vegetables you don't eat. But there's something more. One important mechanism we have discovered in recent years is that as animal products increase over 5% to 10% of total calories, we see the cancer promoting hormone igf-1, insulin-like growth factor one, increased dramatically. And igf-1 is another powerful cancer promoting hormone. It's well established in the scientific literature that... What I'm saying here is that white rice and white bread is like a piece of chicken because they both promote cancer as the amount of processed foods get too high as the amount of animal products too high. So why is a piece of chicken like a slice of white bread? That's right. One, because neither one contains any significant amount of anticancer nutrients called antioxidants and phytochemicals. And two, because both promote hormones that increase the risk of cancer. Certainly there's a threshold fect, meaning a small amount of animal products or a small amount of refined grain such as white rice won't likely promote cancer. When you pass over that threshold, we start to see a stronger and stronger negative effect as these foods rise in the diet. Of course, that threshold could be moved up or down based on your needs. A lower threshold is in order if you have a serious illness you're trying to reverse, and lots of americans are suffering with serious immune system disorders. And the number is continuing to rise. Not only can all this human suffering be prevented, what if you already have one of those troubling illnesses? Should you take drugs to control the symptomshe rest of your life, drugs that are known to cause serious side effects and increase risk of cancer? That's right. I'm saying you can get better even recover without drugs. Autoimmune disease is one of the top causes of death in women younger than 65. Lupus incidents tripled in the UNITED STATES BETWEEN THE 1950s AND 1990s. And death from lupus increased 60% in the 20-year period from 1980 to 2000. Multiple sclerosis and rheumatoid arthritis had similar increases in incidents. Is this genetic? Obviously not. Yet as the amount of human suffering and deaths has been climbing, the medical profession has largely ignored looking at dietary causation. This just doesn't have to be. You know, I can say this because of studies done in the medical literature that has documented the results with nutritional methods, and I can say this because cancer and autoimmune illness are virtually unknown in areas of the world where they eat enough immune supporting foods. And I say this because of my 20-year history with people utilizing a nutritional approach, watching thousands reverse their chronic medical conditions that they were told were irreversible and had nothing to do with food-- like karen schroeder from ocean grove, new jersey. In 2005, karen's joints became very stiff and fatigued and she developed severe pain in her feet, ankles, hips, wrists, and elbows. She was diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis and that began the onslaught of medications. She was told she had to take these medications for the rest of her life, and there were no alternatives. And over the next six years, karen took prednisone, plaquenil, alzulfidine and methatrexate. By 2010, she had worsening side effects. Her white blood cell counts had dropped too low, and she had frequent infections. Her liver enzymes were elevated, and she had gastric and esophageal burning and nausea. She finally had to tell her doctors she'd rather live in pain than suffer with so many medications side effects and higher risk of cancer from medication. Then in january 2011 while searching the internet, karen read about people who'd recovered from rheumatoid arthritis using my immunity solution, and she felt hopeful for the first time in six years. She weaned off all of her medication and followed the plan to the letter. And here's karen's statement. Now you mit not have rheumatoid arthritis like karen, and ceainly not every person is able to achieve a complete remission, but now that you can see the healing potential that most medical doctors completely neglect, you can start to get impressed about the ability of a well-nourished human immune system to protect itself against disease and even reverse disease. See, when you eat the right foods and don't eat the wrong foods, you get well. I told you it was simple, didn't i? 

[03:16:12]


>> Yes. 
>> Nevertheless, these are not isolated instances. These benefits are regularly observed. Let me show you another person who recovered from a serious autoimmune illness. Jodie o'neill from kary, north carolina. Jodie first came to me over ten years ago suffering from psoriatic arthritis, lupus, and autoimmune disease called sjogrens's syndrome. She started experiencing joint pains and skin rashes as a teenager. She was on serious medication and steroids for over 20 years, and she still had psoriasis over here entire body, itching, poor mobility and joint pains not adequately relieved by her medications. She had lesions in her scalp, on her eyelids, inside her ears, and the skin was peeling off her hands and feet. She was a mess. She began my protocol in 2001, and after 30 days the itchiness subsided, and within six months, the entire body was free of psoriatic lesions. Without any effort, she lost 32 pounds, and she's kept those 32 pounds off the last ten years. But her ovarian cyst disappeared. She no longer has osteoporosis. She no longer has chronic sinus infections and congestion and nasal drip, and now at age 62, jodie regained her lost youth and can vigorously exeise and participate in all that healthy active lifestyle has to offer. I know that you want that for your life, too, right? 

[03:30:24]


>> Welcome back to "the immunity solution." This show is aintroduction to the latest nutritional science that can enable your immune system to function at full potential. The immunity solution can reduce your risk of infection, and if you do get sick, it can enable you to bounce back quickly and prevent any damage to your body. The immunity solution can enable to recover from chronic illnesses, even those your doctors may have told you are irreversible. It'll drop your blood pressure and cholesterol, so you no longer need medications and can take away your pain from headaches, arthritis, esophagitis and gastritis no matter what your age is. It can enable you to earn a high quality disease-free life your entire life. In order to activate this miraculous self healing, self repairing powers of your immune system, you need to eat a diet style that offers you comprehensive micronutrient adequacy. Micronutrients are those nutrients needed by the body that do not contain calories. We're not consuming them for energy, like fat, carbohydrates and protein. Those are macronutrients. We are consuming micronutrients because our body requires these immune system activators. There are literally thousands of important phytochems concentrated in colorful natural foods. We need to get them from the real food that contain them because some of the synthetic forms of micronutrients found in supplements can actually promote cancer. For example, take folic acid. We've observed in multiple modern studies that folic acid supplementation could increase the risk of certain cancers, especially breast cancer. We need the real folate found in green vegetables, not the fake folic acid found in supplements. So phytochemicals are not optional. They're essential. It'sot important for you to kn the names of all these phytochemicals because there's thousands of them. But these compounds in green, brown, orange, red, black, blue foods, the full rainbow of natural plant foods, they work like a perfectly synchronized orchestra to enable protection against disease, protect against dementia and even slow the aging process. We discovered some fascinating science about viral infections in recent years as well. We found out that when you don't get enough phytochemicals, a simple virus can mutate and become more dangerous, more virulent. When a persois hospitalized with a dangerous infection, dangerous infection of their heart called a viral cardiomyopathy or a serious infection causing paralysis to their nervous system called guilliane-buree syndrome, we used to think, "oh, how terribly unlucky, this person must've caught this very rare virus that attacked the heart or the nerves." But now we know it's a relatively common virus. It's just a coxsackie virus that can mutate to become dangerous when nutritional deficiencies are present. In the environment of cma, comprehensive micronutrient adequacy, there would be no such attack on the heart, and the ordinary virus would've remained ordinary, unable to mutate to evade immune capture and to become dangerous to the heart or the rest of the body. When your immune system is running on all cylinders, you're not going to be at such risk for recurring sinus infections, ear infections, bronchial infections, and skin infections, and your digestion, headaches, allergies and asthma will improve, too. You know, we have a real healthcare crisis in america, and it's not going to be solved by politicians in washington. We need a population that's highly educated about nutrition, a population that's fully informed, that knows how to protect themselves from diseases. We need a healthy population that requires little medical care. Please remember, I'm not saying that doctors and hospitals don't ever serve a valid function. I'm a medical doctor myself. It's just we've come to rely on medicines and medical procedures instead of taking responsibility for our own health and following simple and powerful methods such as my immunity solution. Remember, the problem from our consumption of refined foods such as white flour products, oils, and white sugar are not that they're just fattening, they cause immune system malfunction. They cause damage, and that means chronic disease and cancer. And not only do animal products and refined foods not contain cancer protective antioxidants and cancer protective phytochemicals, but they're also the foods that promote the cancer causing hormones in the body to rise. And these refined foods and animal products have increased as a percentage of calories in all areas of the world. And correspondingly we see, cancer and heart attack death rates increase in direct proportion. Take a look at this slide where I plotted the amount of natural plant food like fruits and vegetables, beans, seeds, and nuts against the deaths from heart disease, cancer and diabetes. The data demonstrates an interesting pattern where natural produce was low, heart disease and cancer rates are extremely high. Where produce consumption was very high, cancer and heart attack diseases were very, very low, and this is considering the same age group, this 55-75 age group among all these countries. When natural plant food intake is high enough, cancers and heart disease deaths almost disappeared. Now this slide would not look anything like this if I had used 2000 or 2010 statistics. It's based on 1970 data that was COLLECTED IN THE 1960s. That's about 50 years ago. Back then it was possible to find countries eating high amounts of natural plant foods. But even one decade later, america's commercial food interests were spreading everywhere, and the diets of people almost the entire world over were changing for the worse. These diseases of nutritional origin were increasing everywhere. Plus, the animal products we eat today are not the same as the wild animals eaten in yesteryear. Today's factory farmed animals are sickly overfed fattened animals fed junk food, given growth hormones and antibiotics. That's right. They're fed junk food like candy, pretzels, and chips that are damaged during manufacturing and broken and deemed not fit for humans. Actually, all that junk food isn't fit for humans. It's actually poisonous and cancer causing, but nevertheless, we feed this stuff to animals, so now we're eating junk food and junk food animals, too. My health equation is... This equation means your long-term health and how disease resistant you are is proportional to the micronutrient density of your diet. Health is nutrients divided by calories. Nutritional science is not just interesting, it's the most important subject we need to educate ourselves about because our health is just that important. Always keep this in your mind. You eat for health by eating more foods that give you a high micronutrient bang per caloric buck. Now this means not only just the high amount of these micronutrients, but the breadth, the variety of micronutrients. We're talking here about how we extend human lifespan by achieving comprehensive micronutrient adequacy, and that means every peg is filled of every micronutrient we need. And you know what the most important micronutrient that you might need to extend your life, the important micronutrient you need to take to make sure you live longer? The most important one is the one you're missing. So we got to make sure you get all of them. That's the whole point here. Okay, so what I've done here is we've looked at studies, and we see that when people eat less, they live longer. And when animals are fed less food, their telomeres, that's a part of the cell that can shorten or lengthen or stay long, tells you how fast you're aging and how long you're gonna live. And we find that animals that eat less calories, their telomeres stay longer, they don't shrink as they age, so we're slowing the aging process. When we eat less calories, reducing free radical activity, it suppresses genetic defects and genetic alterations. It inhibits the production of cross linking agents and toxins in the cells. So the cell can keep itself clean, it can slow the aging process, and you can live longer and keep your youthful vigor when you consume less calories. But the secret to consuming less calories is not just willy-nilly trying to eat less food, it's getting back to eating foods rich in micronutrients. Because when you eat foods that are rich in micronutrients, then it naturally suppresses the appetite where you're not gonna want to eat as much. So this is not about artificially trying to starve yourself, it's trying to eat more foods that have a high micronutrient per calorie density. The more high micronutrient foods you eat, the less low micronutrient foods you desire. So this program is predominately about eating more high micronutrient foods. Now wouldn't you like to get to your ideal weight without dieting? 

[03:39:45]


>> Yes. 
>> Wouldn't you like to not have to worry about your weight for the rest of your life... 
>> Yes. 
>> And wipe out the risk of serious disease in the process? 
>> Yes. 
>> Of course, you do. We all need this information. It will benefit you, and it'll benefit your loved ones. So I've scored most foods with my andi scoring system, which gives you a great tool to easily identify the most nutrient rich foods. Now andi, a-n-d-i stands for... What I did was measure up all the measurable micronutrients in an equal caloric portion, so an accurate comparison can be made of one food to another. Note how greens, berries, tomatoes, onions, mushrooms, seeds, and even some fruits score pretty high in micronutrients. You see the immunity solution is simple. We flipped the american diet from 10% high nutrient foods and 90% low nutrient foods to 90% high nutrient foods and 10% low nutrient foods. And we do that flip, we make it taste great. You try to eat more foods high in micronutrients and phytochemicals and you automatically desire less calories, you automatically lose the addictive drive to overeat, and you lose weight and you keep it off forever. We eat a dthat tastes better, that feels better and that protects us from dangerous infections, autoimmune illnesses, heart attacks, strokes, dementia, and cancer. Look, if you're still living, and I assume you are if you're watching this show... 
(laughter) That it's not too late to prolong ur life. It's not too late to have a better quality life. So many people have thrown in the towel. They've accepted the negative outcomes predicted by their doctors. This is not for somebody else. This is for you. Whher you're sick or well at this time, don't wait until some serious disease develops. Protect yourlf now. You think about saving for financial needs later in life, but what good is that if you're not well enough or even alive to enjoy it? Your good health is ur greatest wealth. The savings you need to put into your health bank account are those protective nutrients that contue to work in your body every day to protect you against disease. The theme of this program is that disease is unnatural. Health is the natural state, which can only be realized with superior nutrition. I've had so many hundreds of people who've contacted me after watching my last public television program, "three steps to incredible health." Though last year's show was focused more on weight loss, not on the immune system, it changed the lives of thousands of seriously ill people. Don't you want great health and everything life has to offer? Becoming knowledgeable about superior nutrition is a blessing that can give us a better, longer and a more pleasurable life. Don't forget I said more pleasurable because you can't enjoy life when you're sick. And food even tastes best when you have a healthy appetite and a healthy hunger, and your taste improves. You enjoy eating more when you eat healthfully. What I'm telling you here is that your immune system is the mastermind behind your body's ability to resist disease. You don't just develop serious diseases or get cancer overnight or even in a few years. It doesn't happen from something you did ten years ago. It's a slow process of gradually increasing cellular damage that takes many decades of immune system weakness. 

[04:06:57]


>> We're back with "dr. Fuhrman's immunity solution." 
>> Thank you. Welcome back to the "immunity solution." And this is part three, the fun part of the show where we get to talk about food. As if I wasn't talking about it already, right? Now I want you to learn two important new words. Words that I made up-- nutritarian and g-bombs. I want you to eat a nutritarian diet. That's a diet that's strives for nutritional excellence. ...Is a nutritarian. And my goal is to have you enjoy life to the fullest as a practicing nutritarian. I insist it'll make your life more enjoyable, not just disease resistant. Now keep in mind, a vegetarian or a vegan could also be a nutritarian if the diet is designed healthfully. And a person who eats some animal products could also be a nutritarian if their diet is designed healthfully. A nutritarian learns about the most powerful healing foods and consumes them regularly. The second word I want you to learn is g-bombs. G-bombs--g, b, o, m, b, s. It's an acronym that helps you remember the super foods you need to eat regularly to drive the immunity solution. These are the foods richest in anticancer phytochemicals that we don't get enough of in the s.A.D.--The standard american diet. Foods that contain nutrients essential to the immunity solution. So let's talk about green vegetables first. The consumption of raw greens has been proven to reduce cancer rates in more than 200 separate scientific studies. In each of our cells is a dna sequence called the antioxidant response element. It's like a protective force field around the ship in star trek. Your cells have this anticancer force field and it's fueled by green vegetables. And the greens that have the most powerful fuel for the cells protective function are-- examples of cruciferous vegetables are-- for example, in a recent medical study, men who ate 28 servings of vegetables a week, decreased their instance of prostate cancer by 33%. However, if they ate just three servings of cruciferous vegetables a week, they decreased the occurrence of prostate cancer by 41%. That's three servings of cruciferous, more powerful than 28 servings of regular vegetables. The more cruciferous vegetables consumed, the lower the rate of cancer. This is partularly true of breast cancer. A recent study showed that the daily intake of cruciferous vegetables decreased breast cancer deaths by 62%, compared to women who did not eat cruciferous vegetables. And this radical decrease in deaths from breast cancer is even observed in women who already have a diagnosis of of breast cancer. Amazing isn't it? Don't you think every person should learn about this and know this? 

[04:10:20]


>> Yes. 
>> A group of powerful compounds from cruciferous vegetables that offers this protection is called ISOTHIOCYANATES OR ITCs. There are over 120 different TYPES OF ITCs, AND THEY HAVE Different effects on the cell to move carcinogens and repair defects that could lead to cancer. What is fascinating is that THESE ITCs ARE NOT IN THE Vegetable yet before you eat it. But as you chew it, the cell wall of the vegetable releases an enzyme called myrosinase THAT FORMS THE ITCs IN YOUR Mouth before you even swallow. If you chop or blend the veggies well, you will have the same effect to form these compounds. So the better these vegetables are chewed, the better they're chopped or blended, more BENEFICIAL ITCs ARE RELEASED Into the body. The next super food I want you to eat is beans. Scientists discovered a new potent anticancer compound in this fun to eat food. And the name of this compound is long, actually 26 letters long, and it's so hard to pronounce, so it must be important. It's-- this compound was found to inhibit a key enzyme involved in tumor growth. That's right. When you eat beans regularly, they prevent tumors from forming in the body. Plus, they're rich in anticancer polyphenols. Accordingly, a recent study showed that men who ate beans or legumes regularly had a 40% lower risk of prostate cancer. And numerous studies show beans dramatically cut colon cancer risk, too. A 6-year study tracking over 32,000 individuals found those who ate beans, peas or lentils only twice a week decreased their risk of colon cancer by 50%. Wow! If they cut their chance of colon cancer in half by eating beans twice a week, imagine the benefits of eating beans daily. You may not have any friends left, but at least you won't get cancer. Seriously, though, if you do eat beans on a regular basis, your body builds up the bacteria you need to digest them, and you don't get the indigestion and gas. The other fascinating thing about beans is that they're very high in fiber and resistant starch. Resistant starch is resistant to being digested and that means that lots of the carbohydrate calories in beans do not get absorbed by the body. They just pass through us, making beans a very weight-loss favorable food. That's right, about half the carb calories in beans do not get absorbed. So beans make you feel full, they stabilize your blood sugar, they protect you against cancer, and they help you lose weight. Onions are next. Who would have imagined that onions could be so protective against cancer? A multi-country european study tracked the consumption of food and cancer and found the one most protective variable for prostate cancer was onions. And the strongest causative factor was animal product consumption, specifically meat and dairy. Now if we look at all the studies on prostate cancer, we find that tomatoes get all the publicity because they're about a hundred studies showing a protective effect of tomatoes on prostate cancer. Now even though there may not be as many studies done on onions and cancer, but if you look at the strength of the effect in those studies, we find that onions have even a stronger, more protective effect than tomatoes do. Pooling numerous studies from 37 different countries on onions and cancer, we find between 50% and 88% reduction in the instance of various cancers. And some of the green vegetables, the green cruciferous vegetables, when you cut the onion, it causes a chemical reaction to occur. And the same reaction that creates the acid that makes your eyes burn, is a reaction that forms these organosulfide compounds with their powerful anticancer effects. So the point to remember here is that the enzyme is heat sensitive. So to increase the cancer fighting power of onions in your diet, you want to eat some raw onion and chew them very well. If you cook the onion, and then cut it up or blended it, then it won't give off that gas that makes your eyes tear. So you won't produce those anticancer compounds. But if you chop it or blend it first, when it's raw, you can still cook the onion after and maintain most of the benefits because the organosulfide compounds are not to destroyed by cooking. You just have to make sure you chop it up really fine before you cook it so those organosulfide compounds are formed before cooking. Do you follow that? 

[04:14:47]


>> Yes. 
>> All right, now guess-- who is the king of the cancer fighting all-stars? NOPE, NOT LeBRON JAMES. 
>> (audience laughs) 
>> It's mushrooms. Mushrooms have three important and unique cancer defenses. First, they contain-- antigen-binding lectins. That means they stick to the surfaces of abnormal cells so the body can recognize and attack those cells removal before they become cancerous. Fascinating isn't it? 
>> (audience) YES. 
>> Our immune system has the ability to fully recognize abnormal cells and remove them, but only when it becomes fully activated when you eat mushrooms. The second important cancer fighting feature of mushrooms is that they're strong angiogenesis inhibitors. That means these compounds inhibit new blood vessel growth. See in order for a tumor to grow, in order for cells to become cancerous, and spread they have to send out signals that create new blood vessels to grow and feed them with nutrients and oxygen. And mushrooms say, no way. They inhibit the enzymes released by abnormal cells. That promote blood vessel growth thereby restricting the oxygen and nutrients from getting to those cells. So these substances derived from mushrooms starve off tumors and cancers. And the fat on your body is also like a tumor. It secretes hormones that stimulates growth of blood vessels also. The fat can't grow without a delivery system of highways that bring it more calories and mushrooms stop that delive. They won't let fat grow easily on your body either. The third important protective feature of mushrooms is they contain aromatase inhibitors. These compounds prevent the body from making excess estrogen. And they protect the breast tissue from being stimulated from circulating estrogen. Now because of this, mushrooms are powerfully protective against breast cancer. It's as if mushrooms are a necessary armor for our immunity system. Look, your car needs gas and oil, and your immune system needs greens, onions and mushrooms, or it simply is not going to function normally. So let's move on to berries. I love that berries taste great, they're certainly a great diet and weight loss food. As they're also so low in calories they even have a low glycemic load for a diabetic. But did you know that berries can slow ageing of the berries and prevent dementia? Did you know berries have powerful anticancer benefits? Ellagic acid and anthocyanins are prominent phytochemicals in berries that inhibit the growth of abnormal cells and cancer cells. One recent study gave strawberry concentrates to patients with esophagus cancer and found that the cancers reversed or stopped progressing. Amazingl anticancer potential here is even surprising the researchers involved in these studies who've reported to me that this is a hotbed of recent excitement. What's observed is that we can almost wipe out cancers in anims genetically prone to get the cancers, when a mixture of these particular super foods are put together and fed to these animals. So the last on your g-bombs list right, g, b, o, m, b, s, the last on your list, is seeds. Don't forget those seeds every day. Numerous studies on seeds and lignans derived from seeds is simply spectacular, and it's important you know about it. I'll just give you the results of two important studies. You'll get the point. A double blinded placebo controlled trial with flaxseed was done where they gave women who had breast cancer a flax seed containing muffin each day. And, of course, half the women in the study got muffin that looked just like that, but didn't have the flaxseeds. And six weeks later, the breast cancer tumors were biopsied and analyzed, and they found significant cancer cell death and regression of cancer proliferation, which means the growth of the cancer, in the group that had the flax. Another study on the lignans from seeds studied women who had breast cancer and they tracked the amount of lignans consumed, over a 10-year period. You see, lignans are rich in flaxseeds, chia seeds, some other seeds, the women who ate the most ligna which was less than 1 milligram a day had a 71% decrease in breast cancer mortality over that 10-year period. Now one teaspoon of flax or chia seeds have about 7 milligrams of lignans, and in the study less than 1 milligram decreased breast cancer deaths by over 70%. That's truly amazing. So here's my nutritarian prescription for you. Number one-- do you eat some beans every day? You should. I wa you to. Check that off. It's important. Do you eat least a cup of berries and two other fruits a day? Are you having three fresh fruits a day? You got to check it off. It's one thing you have to do. It's part of the formula here. Now that 1 ounce of raw nuts and seeds, I want an half an ounce from--i want at least a tablespoon of chia seeds or sesame seeds or flaxseeds hemp seeds, I want at least a tablespoon of those seeds to get the lignans you need. I want some of those nuts and seeds to be some walnuts if possible for the omega-3 fatty acids. Have all the seeds and nuts you want, have the types you want, but have some of the hemp, chia, flax, or some walnuts for those mega-3 fatty acids, and then have some other nuts and seeds, pistachio nuts, pecans, you kn, mac--whatever you want, and I'm gonna give you incredibly great recipe ideas for this, too. One big salad, I want a sign on your refrigerator that says that salad is the main dish. Take out a marker, make a nice sign and--at least one of the meal, make the salad as the main dish--a big salad. Chop up the veg--the lettuce and the cabbage and the tomatoes and the red onion, put a delicious nut-based dressing on it, make a delicious tasting salad, kiwis or strawberries, or cherry tomatoes or sun dried totoes in there, make a roasted garlic dressing. One of my favorite dressings has roasted garlic, almonds whipped up a little tomato sauce a little fig vinegar or balsamic vinegar, whipped up, tastes fantastic on a salad. Okay, so at least one nice salad every day, and the half a cup of beans, you can dump it right on top of the salad if you want. Have at least one double size portion, maybe at night. Maybe you're havinsoup and a salad with lunch and a big serving of greens and a fruit bowl for dinner, or a small salad for dinner, but have a serving, maybe with mushrooms or some green vegetable, like asparagus, like broccoli, cabbage, artichokes. String beans, broccoli, have a nice serving of cooked greens every day. And don't forget check off on your list, have some mushrooms or onions every day. You goal is to have half a cup of onions a day, and mushrooms, you just need a little bit, just a small amount every day, just have some every day on a regular basis. They're tremendously protective. So what happens when you do this? Let's look at some people who tried it. Consider tom deck from rochester, new york. Tom was an overweight food addict and most of his life he weighed 365 pounds. He had high blood pressure and was diabetic for over 40 years. And as a result of this severe out of control diabetes, he had a toe amputated. He developed severe nausea and exhaustion and was found to have acute renal failure. He was told he was close to having to be put on dialysis. Then he was in bed watching my show, and tom said it was an answer to his prayers and those of his family, and his friends thought he wasn't gonna make it. Tom lost 56 pounds in the first five months and amazingly never felt deprived. And he says he enjoyed eating more than any time in his life. And he didn't have to count calories and measure food. Remember, he'd been a food addict his whole life. And he never could stick to any diet before. Tom was taking 12 prescription medications daily and injecting himself with insulin four times each day. Soon his type 2 diabetes was gone, so tom said, "my kidney doctor was practically jumping up and down during my last visit. I was a former food addict, and if I can succeed and enjoy dr. Fuhrman's program with all my problems, anybody can. I hope this letter can give help and hope to the millions of people who are searching for an answer. To wrap it up, all my many health problems have been a thing of the past. And within a month after starting, I have boundless energy. I weigh less than half of what I used to weigh. And my doctors are all saying what has happened is almost a miracle." It's not a miracle. It just demonstrates the power of mod

Issed the deadline but two hours into the new year pthe senate voted in favor of a budget deal that now goes to the house and president obama wants action today. 
>>> Revelers from around the GLOBE, FROM rio de Janeiro and beyond, welcome 2013 with a bang. And a few peculiar traditions. 
>>> We say good-bye to the safest year in air travel forever and say hello to over 400 new laws. Good morning on this first day of january and a happy wonderful new year to you all. I'm bill karins. It's up to the house. They're expected to take up a senate measure approved just hours after midnight aimed at halting an enormous tax hike for all but the wealthiest of americans from taking effect. 89 in favor, 8 no-votes coming from three democrats and five republicans. Nbc's steve handelsman has the latest details from capitol hill. Good morning and happy new year to you. 
>> Reporter: Bill, thanks, good morning on capitol hill. Members of both political parties who badly want these middle class taxes rolled back fast, "what the senate did this morning makes it easier for house republicans to follow suit. It was a rare bipartisan vote, 89-8. Two hours after america went off the fiscal cliff, vice president biden came to the capitol to sell the fix he worked out with GOP LEADER mitch McConnell to spoke for senate republicans. 
>> We don't think taxes should be going up on anyone. But we all knew if we did nothing, they'd be going up on everyone. 
>> Reporter: The senate voted to reverse today's tax hikes on 98% of americans. But to keep the higher rate on families making over $450,000, president obama took credit for breaking 20 years of gop opposition to tax hikes. 
>> Keep in mind that just last month, republicans in congress said they would never agree to raise tax rates on the wealthi est americans. 

[00:02:09]


>> Middle class families will wake up today to the assurance their taxes won't go up $2,200 each. 
>> Reporter: Not so fast. House speaker john boehner and his gop lawmakers might not go along. Boehner sent house members home to celebrate the new year without a vote to avoid the fiscal cliff. 
>> Listen, this is disgusting. And everybody involved should be embarrassed. 
>> Reporter: The economy could still take a hit. While the house takes up maybe later today whether to follow the senate's lead and hike taxes on the wealthy. From capitol hill, steve handelsman, nbc news. Bill, back to you. 
>> Reaction to the senate's move was swift as many people were still up welcoming the new year. Familiar faces on msnbc were in rare form starting with joe scarborough who tweeted, why can't washington ever put together a deal that cults spent? This deal fails on most counts. It's a distressing failure of leadership. "Morning joe" regular steve ratner tweeted, the only thing worse than this deal would have been no deal, or maybe not, he added. Ezra kline wrote, obama isn't making it easier for res to vote for this deal but probably THINKS IF THE Rs KILL IT THEY Get all the fiscal cliff blame. 
>>> Now deals on secretary of state hillary clinton and the blood clot that has her hospitalized. The clot is located in a vein in the space between her brain and skull near her right ear. It did not cause a stroke or neurological damage. Doctors say clinton should make a full recovery and she is making excellent progress. The blood clot is related to the concussion clinton suffered earlier this month. It was discovered during a follow-up exam sunday. 
>>> From amazing fireworks displays to ancient traditions to our favorite polar plunges. Folks around the world marked the beginning of 2013 in their own unique way. Kirk gregory takes us on a tour of all those crazy celebrations. 

[00:04:15]


>> Reporter: The first major city to celebrate 2013 was auckland, new zealand. Fireworks and boat horns rang in the new year. In austraa, a seven-ton fireworks display dazzled hundreds of thousands in sydney. With an estimated 1 billion people watching on tv worldwide. A large crowd counted down to the new year in shanghai, china. While in tokyo, japan, buddhist monks rang bells to cleanse sins. Nato soldiers serving in afghanistan took time to let loose and dance their way into 2013. Nato hasore than 100,000 soldiers serving in afghanistan, including some 66,000 u.S. Forces. In centralr russia, these brave souls took an icy dip to greet the new year. The water temperature, a brisk 37 degrees. While in the united arab emirates, the world's tall els building set the stage for a giant celebration. In paris, tens of thousands celebrated at the eiffel tower. While in london, big ben rang out the old and rang in the new. And the tradition continued in the big apple. Tens of thousands crammed into times square to officially welcome 2013. Kirk gregory, nbc news. 
>> Beautiful kisses to start the new year. 
>>> On the first day of the new year, more than 400 new laws go into effect around the country. Here are just a few. In maryland, same-sex couples now have the right to marry. And the wedding ceremonies started just after midnight in baltimore. California and illinois have both banned employers from forcing their workers or job applicants to hand over passwords from their personal facebotwitter accounts. California's also outlawed using hounds to hunt bobcats or bears after lawmakers decided it's not a fair fight. In florida, flash away. Police can no longer give tickets to drivers who flash their headlights to let fellow motorists know there's a speed trap ahead. 

[00:06:29]


>>> Here's your new year's day look at this morning's dish of scrambled politics. Former utah governor and republican president jon huntsman told "the daily telegraph" the gop is like a holding company that is "devoid of soul." A new gallup found president obama is the most-admired man in america. For the fifth straight year, in the same poll, the most admired woman, hillary clinton. Guess how many years in a row? 11. After this morning's vote on the fiscal cliff, outgoing texas senator kay bailey hutchison tweeted this at 2:43 a.M. I just cast my last vote in the u.S. Senate. It has been an honor to serve in the greatest nation on theers. 
>>> The term fiscal cliff, i tried getting it banned, is at the top of the 38th annual list of words to be banished by lake superior state university. Others on the list of unliked words? Double down. Plus spoiler alert. Trending and guru. And a new petition has been started on the white house website calling for an end to stupid petitions. It says, white house petitions are being gamed to the point of absurdity and maybe it's time for the petition to end all petitions. Meaning this one. And that's yourmorning dish of "scrambled politics." 
>>> Let me get you out the door or sit on your couch to enjoy your plans for later in the day. I know last night it was freezing cold in the northern plains. Painfully cold in areas like fargo, indianapolis. A lot of people probably decided to stay indoors. It's going to be that way all day. Look at kansas city, denver, chicago. The coldest air of this winter season is headed your way. The east coast, a little warmer, no problems there temperature-wise. We do have to deal with rain. It was pouring last night for new year's in some areas of east texas, houston, shreveport. The rain is trying to shift toward new orleans. We have rainy wet weather in areas of northern mississippi, streaming through tennessee and areas of the carolinas. That's where your wet weather's going to be on new year's day. Here's a closer view of the radar. Rain, no snow, no ice to deal with, anything like that. But kind of a rainy, gloomy start to your new year, especially northern mississippi, alabama, north georgia, as we go throughout the day. Your new year's day forecast, first of 2013, no big storms out there on the way. It looks like a quiet start weather-wise to 2013. 

[00:09:00]


>>> Minimum wage goes up in ten states today. A decent year for stocks. Did you notice? Plus 2012 was the safest year for air travel ever. You're watching "first look" on this first day of january 2013. 
Woman: We're helping joplin, missouri, come back from a devastating tornado. 
Man: And now we're helping the east coast recover from hurricane sandy. We're a leading global insurance company, based right here in america. We've repaid every dollar america lent us. Everything,plus a profit of more than $22 billion. For the american people. Thank you, america. Helping people recover and rebuild -- that's what we do. Now let's bring on tomorrow. Victor! I got your campbell's chunky soup. Mom? Who's mom? I'm the giants mascot. The giants don't have a mascot! Ohhh! Eat up! New jammin jerk chicken soup has tasty pieces of chicken with rice and beans. Hmmm. For giant hunger! Thanks mom! See ya! Whoaa...Oops! Mom? I'm ok. Grandma? Hi sweetie! She operates the head. 

[00:11:09]


[ Male Announcer ] CAMPBELL'S CHUNKY SOUP. It fills you up right. 
>>> Happy new year and welcome back. Some stories making news this morning. Two people were killed and three injured in a new year's eve shooting in sacramento, california. Officials canceled the midnight fireworks show that had been scheduled. 
>>> The israeli military says shipments of building materials will be allowed into the gaza strip as long as the relative quiet along the border holds. It's israel's first key concession of a cease-fire made last month. 
>>> The food and drug administration has approved the first new tuberculosis drug in more than four decades. It's for use with older drugs to fight a hard to treat strain of tuberculosis that has not responded to other medications. 
>>> Members of the motion picture academy has an extra day to vote for oscar nominations. Problems with the new electronic oscar voting system, like forgetting passwords, might cause low turnout for nominations. 

[00:13:13]


>> There's one milestone we want to mention, considering the general dissatisfaction americans feel for air travel despite the cost and the sheer hassle, the fact is 2012 is in the record books as the safest year for air travel ever. Not just in this country, around the world. Nbc's tom costello reports. 
>> Reporter: The numbers speak volumes. Every day worldwide, there are 93,000 commercial airline flights. 3 billion passengers a year. And yet not a single fatal commercial airline accident in the u.S. In nearly four years. Worldwide, 2012 is going down as the safest year ever, with just one accident for every 5.4 million flights. Veteran aviation safety expert john cox. 
>> What's sigficant about that is that we're improving by 50% over last year, which was the aviation's safest year previously. 
>> Reporter: Why the improvement? Pilots have never been better trained. Computerized cockpits monitor every aspect of flight. Alert systems warn of a potential mid-air crash or mountain ahead. Hd simulators for pilots and air traffic controllers train them to handle emergencies before they face a real one. Debbie herzman is chairman of ntsb. 
>> We've learned from accidents, plowed those lessons back, in they've been embraced and we're not seeing repeats of those same accidents. 
>> Reporter: Experts say two accidents in which human failure was at least partly to blame underscore that remains the biggest threat to safety. Air france 447 crashed into the atlantic in 2009, killing 228. That same year, regional airline colgan air flight 447 crashed in buffalo, killing 50. 
>> Colgan air was a watershed event for aviation safety, in particular, bringing the regional carriers up to standards with the major carriers. 

[00:15:14]


>> Reporter: The safety culture is spreading. Accident rates are dropping in russia, africa, latin america, the caribbean, and asia. Despite the dramatic improvement experts say there's danger here. Just when you start to think, it can't happen again, is often when you're the most vulnerable. Tom cocostello, nbc news, washington. 
>>> Stocks provided many 401(k)s, PENSIONS, AND OTHER Investors pretty good news last year. Despite the bad economic news. Traders get the day off but the dow was up 7.3%. The nasdaq up a healthy almost 16%. The s&p 500 had its best finnish three years soaring to over 13%. Starting today the minimum wage goes up between 10 and 35 cents an hour for workers in ten states having an impact on the income of about 1 million workers. 
>>> Get ready for groceries to get more expensive this year. If they're not expensive enough, prices are expected to rise. 
>>> Ford can climb to have the best-selling car around the globe with the ford focus claiming the top spot. Did not know that. 
>>> For what it's worth, a few so-called financial experts tell our friends at cnbc apple stock could grow as much as 20% over the next few years because the company plans to accelerate product upgrades. 
>>> In sports, start with college football. An exciting new year's eve finished the chick-fil-a bowl. Clemson down two, the kick, this is to beat lsu. Good. S.E.C. Loses, acc wins, 25-24. Nice upset by clemson. In the sun bowl, georgia tech scored two touchdowns in the second half against usc for a 21-7 victory. Usc was the preseason number one team in the country, finished 7-6. In the music city bowl, vanderbilt's jordan rogers connected on two touchdown passes and ran for another, commodores won 38-24. Liberty bowl, tulsa's alex singleton scored three touchdowns as the golden hurricane beat iowa state 31-17. 

[00:17:23]


>>> There are six more bowl games today, starting with the gator bowl. Mississippi state against northwestern. Then it's purdue versus oklahoma state in the heart of dallas bowl. I love these names. In the outback bowl, south carolina faces michigan. In the capital one bowl, georgia takes on corn huskers from nebraska. To the rose bowl. Wisconsin against number six stanford. In the orange bowl, this one has my interest. Because northern illinois is paying 12th ranked florida state. 
>>> In the nfl, not a good day to be a head coach. All the following fired. The eagles' andy reid, chargers '94 of turner, bears' lovie smith, that's after a winning record but a bad year. The browns' pat shurmur. Also cut loose, chiefs' romeo cornell, bills' chan galery. Jets' rex ryan survived the day. 
>>> At the annual car jumping championship in england, drivers used a ramp to try to fly over ten wrecked dars and land on the other side. Most of the fearless competitors weren't even close. Not like they're really trying. 
>>> Just ahead, keeping up with the kardashians is about to get a ratings bump. Wish I wrote that but I didn't. 
>>> While we don't condone wasting food, check out this fruitcake toss. Details next. You're watching "first look" on MSNBC.r myself. With so much noise about health care... I tuned it all out. With UnitedHealthcare, I get information that matters... My individual health profile. Not random statistics. They even reward me for addressing my health risks. So I'm doing fine... but she's still going to give me a heart attack. We're more than 78,000 people looking out for more than 70 million Americans. That's health in numbers. UnitedHealthcare. 

[00:21:26]


>>> Congress won't win any awards for public service this year, but recipients of the congressional medal of honor are another story. They remind us what it means to serve our country. In war, yes. Also at home and every day of their lives. Nbc's mike taibbi has the story of two veterans who are passing along ward-won lessons to a new generation. 
>> Reporter: At first blush it wasn't much of a parade. A couple of hundred yards, a crowd just a few deepal the way. And two old soldiers the honored guests. 
>> We are proud of you! 
>> Reporter: Perhaps no one deserves a parade more. Major general pat brady and lieutenant colonel bruce crandall recipients of the congressional medal of honor. For both men, both helicopter evac pilots, vietnam was their war. Brady saving more than 60 wounded in one day of pure hell in 1968. And crandall, three years earlier, braving enemy fire on 22 straight missions. The stories celebrated in the hollywood film "we were soldiers." 
>> Medevac command, are you inpound?

But two hours into the new year the sete voted in favor of a budget deal that now goes to the house and president obama wants action today. 
>>> Revelers from around the GLOBE, FROM rio de Janeiro and beyond, welcome 2013 with a bang. And a few peculiar traditions. 
>>> We say good-bye to the safest year in air travel ever, and say hello to over 400 new laws. Good morning on this first day of january and a happy wonderful new year to you all. I'm bill karins. 
>>> Now it's all up to the house. They're expected to take up a senate measure approved just hours after midnight aimed at halting an enormous tax hike for all but the wealthiest of americans from taking effect. The final vote was 89 in favor of the deal with 8 no-votes coming from three democrats and five republicans. Nbc's steve handelsman has the latest details from capitol hill. Steve? Good morning and happy new year to you. 
>> Reporter: Bill, thanks, good morning on capitol hill. Members of both political parties who badly want these middle class taxes rolled back fast hope what the senate did this morning makes it easier for house republicans to follow suit. It was a rare bipartisan vote, 89-8. Two hours after america went off the fiscal cliff, vice president biden came to the capitol to sell the fix he worked out with GOP LEADER mitch McConnell who spoke for senate republicans. 
>> We don't think taxes should be going up on anyone. But we all knew if we did nothing, they'd be going up on everyone. 
>> Reporter: The senate voted to reverse today's tax hikes on 98% of americans. But to keep the higher rate on families making over $450,000. President obama took credit for breaking 20 years of gop opposition to tax hikes. 
>> Keep in mind that just last month, republicans in congress said they would never agree to raise tax rates on the wealthiest americans. 

[00:02:07]


>> Reporter: Five senate republicans voted no. 
>> Middle class families will wake up today to the assurance their taxes won't go up $2,200 each. 
>> Reporter: Not so fast. House speaker john boehner and his gop lawmakers might not go along. Boehner sent house members home to celebrate the new year without a vote to avoid the fiscal cliff. 
>> Listen, this is disgusting. And everybody involved should be embarrassed. 
>> Reporter: The economy could still take a hit. While the house takes up maybe later today whether to follow the senate's lead and hike taxes on the wealthy. From capit hill, steve handelsman, nbc news. Bill, back to you. 
>> Reaction to the senate's move was swifas many people were still up welcoming the new year. Familiar faces on msnbc were in rare form starting with joe scarborough who tweeted, why can't washington ever put together a deal that cuts spending? This deal fails on most counts. It's a distressing failure of leadership. "Morning joe" regular steve ratner tweeted, the only thing worse than this deal would have been no deal, or maybe not, he added. Ezra klein wrote, obama isn't MAKING IT EASIER FOR Rs TO VOTE For this deal but probably THINKS IF THE Rs KILL IT THEY Get all the fiscal cliff blame. 
>>> New information on secretary of state hillary clinton and the blood clot that has her hospitalized. The clot is located in a vein in the space between her brain and skull near her right ear. It did not cause a stroke or neurological damage. Doctors say clinton should make a full recovery and she is making excellent progress. The blood clot is related to the concussion clinton suffered earlier this month. It was discovered during a follow-up exam sunday. 
>>> From amazing fireworks displays to ancient traditions to our favorite polar plunges. Folks around the world marked the beginning of 2013 in their own unique way. Nbc's kirkregory takes us on a tour of all those crazy celebrations. 

[00:04:16]


>> Reporter: The first major city to celebrate 2013 was auckland, new zealand. Fireworks and boat horns rang in the new year. In australia, a seven-ton fireworks display dazzled hundreds of thousands in sydney. With an estimated 1 billion people watching on tv worldwide. A large crowd counted down to the new year in shanghai, china. While in tokyo, japan, buddhist monks rang bells to cleanse sins. Nato soldiers serving in afghanistan took time to let loose and dance their way into 2013. Nato has more than 100,000 soldiers serving in afghanistan, including some 66,000 u.S. Forces. In central russia, these brave souls took an icy dip to greet the new year. The water temperature, a brisk 37 degrees. While in the united arab emirates, the world's tallest building set the stage for a giant celebration. In paris, tens of thousands celebrated at the eiffel tower. While in london, big ben rang out the old and rang in the new. And the tradition continued in the big apple. Tens of thousands crammed into times square to officially welcome 2013. Kirk gregory, nbc news. 
>> Beautiful kisses to start the new year. 
>>> On the first day of the new year, more than 400 new laws go into effect around the country. Here are just a few. In maryland, same-sex couples now have the right to marry. And the wedding ceremonies started just after midnight in baltimore. California and illinois have both banned employers from forcing their workers or job applicants to hand over passwords from their personal facebook or twitter accounts. California's also outlawed using hounds to hunt bobcats or bears after lawmakers decided it's not a fair fight. In florida, flash away. Police can no longer give tickets to drivers who flash their headlights to let fellow motorists know there's a speed trap ahead. 

[00:06:30]


>>> Here's your new year's day look at this morning's dish of scrambled politics. Former utah governor and republican president candidate jon huntsman told "the daily telegraph" the gop is like a holding company that is "devoid of soul." 
>>> A new gallup found president obama is the most-admired man in america. Is this our first poll of the new year? For the fifth straight year. The same poll found the most-admired woman, hillary clinton. Guess how many years in a row? 11. After this morning's vote on the fiscal cliff, outgoing texas senator kay bailey hutchison tweeted this at 2:43 a.M. I just cast my last vote in the u.S. Senate. It has been an honor to serve in the greatest nation on the earth. 
>>> The term fiscal cliff, i tried getting it banned, is at the top of the 38th annual list of words to be banished by lake superior state university. Others on the list of unliked words? Double down. Plus spoiler alert. Trending. And guru. 
>>> And a new petition has been started on the white house website calling for an end to stupid petitions. It says, white house petitions are being gamed to the point of absurdity and maybe it's time for the petition to end all petitions. Meaning this one. And that's your morning dish of "scrambled politics." 
>>> Let me get you out the door or sit on your couch to enjoy your plans for later in the day. Let me get you up to date on your forecast. I know last night it was freezing cold in the northern plains. Painfully cold in areas like fargo, minneapolis, a lot of people probably decided to stay indoors. It's going to be that way all day. Windchills still in the negative numbers. Look at kansas city, denver, chicago. The coldest air of this winter season is headed your way. The east coast, a little warmer, no problems there temperature-wise. We do have to deal with rain. It was pouring last night for new year's in some areas of east texas, houston, shreveport. The rain is trying to shift toward new orleans. We have rainy wet weather in areas of northern mississippi, streaming through tennessee and areas of the carolinas. That's where your wet weather's going to be on new year's day. Here's a closer view of the radar. It's just plain old rain. There's no snow, no ice to deal with, anything like that. But kind of a rainy, gloomy start to your new year, especially northern mississippi, alabama, north georgia, as we go throughout the day. Your new year's day forecast, first of 2013, no big storms out there on the way. It looks like a quiet start weather-wise to 2013. 

[00:09:00]


>>> Minimum wage goes up in ten states today. A decent year for stocks. Did you notice? Plus 2012 was the safest year for air travel ever. You're watching "first look" on this first day of january 2013. 
[ sneezes ] 
[ sniffles ] 
[ Female Announcer ] FOR EVERYTHING YOUR Face has to face. Face it with puffs facial tissues. Pp puffs has air-fluffed pillows PP FOR 40% MORE CUSHIONYrr THICKNESS. Face every day with puffs softness. Ring. Progresso. I just served my mother-in-law your Chicken Noodle soup but she loved it so much... I told her it was homemade. Everyone tells a little white lie now and then. But now she wants my recipe 

[00:12:08]


[ clears his throat ] [ softly ] She's right behind me isn't she? 
[ Male Announcer ] Progresso. You gotta taste this soup. 
>>> Happy new year and welcome back. Some stories making news this morning. Two people were killed and three injured in a new year's eve shooting in sacramento, california. Officials canceled the midnight fireworks show that had been scheduled. 
>>> The israeli military says shipments of building materials will be allowed into the gaza strip as long as the relative quiet along the border holds. It's israel's first key concession of a cease-fire made last month. 
>>> The food and drug administration has approved the first new tuberculosis drug in more than four decades. It's for use with older drugs to fight a hard to treat strain of tuberculosis that has not responded to other medications. 
>>> Members of the motion picture academy has an extra day to vote for oscar nominations. Problems with the new electronic oscar voting system, like forgetting passwords, might cause low turnout for nominations. 
>>> Looking back at 2012, there's one milestone we want to mention. Considering the general dissatisfaction americans feel for air travel, despite the cost and the sheer hassle, the fact is 2012 is in the record books as the safest year for air travel ever. Not just in this country, around the world. Nbc's tom costello reports. 
>> Reporter: The numbers speak volumes. Every day worldwide, there are 93,000 commercial airline flights. 3 billion passengers a year. And yet not a single fatal commercial airline accident in the u.S. In nearly four years. Worldwide, 2012 is going down as the safest year ever, with just one accident for every 5.4 million flights. Veteran aviation safety expert john cox. 
>> What's significant about that is that we're improving by 50% over last year, which was the aviation's safest year previously. It's an incredible feat. 

[00:14:14]


>> Reporter: Why the imprement? Pilots have never been better trained. Computerized cockpits monitor every aspect of flight. Alert systems warn of a potential mid-air crash or mountain ahead. Hd simulators for pilots and air traffic controllers train them to handle emergencies before they face a real one. Debbie hersman is chairman of ntsb. 
>> We've learned from accidents, plowed those lessons back in, they've been embraced and we're not seeing repeats of those same accidents. 
>> Reporter: Experts say two accidents in which human failure was at least partly to blame underscore that remains the biggest threat to safety. Air france 447 crashed into the atlantic in 2009, killing 228. That same year, regional airline colgan air flight 3407 crashed in buffalo, killing 50. 
>> Colgan air was a watershed event for aviation safety, in particular, bringing the regional carriers up to standards with the major carriers. 
>> Reporter: The safety culture is spreading. Accident rates are dropping in russia, africa, latin america, the caribbean, and asia. Despite the dramatic improvement in safety, experts say there's a real danger here. Just when you start to think, it can't happen again, is often when you're the most vulnerable. Tom costello, nbc news, washington. 
>> Thanks, tom. 2012 may be history but STOCKS PROVIDED MANY 401(k)s, Pensions, and other investors pretty good news last year. Despite the bad economic news. Traders get the day off but the dow was up 7.3%. The nasdaq up a healthy almost 16%. The s&p 500 had its best finish in three years soaring to over 13%. Starting today the minimum wage goes up between 10 and 35 cents an hour for workers in ten states having an impact on the income of about 1 million workers. 
>>> Get ready for groceries to get more expensive this year. If they're not expensive enough, prices are expected to rise. 

[00:16:18]


>>> Ford can claim to have the best-selling car around the globe with the ford focus claiming the top spot. Did not know that. 
>>> For what it's worth, a few so-called financial experts tell our friends at cnbc apple stock could grow as much as 20% over the next few years because the company plans to accelerate product upgrades. We shall see. 
>>> In sports, start with college football. An exciting new year's eve finish to the chick-fil-a bowl. Clemson down two, the kick, this is to beat lsu. Good. S.E.C. Loses, acc wins, 25-24. Nice upset by clemson. In the sun bowl, georgia tech scored two touchdowns in the second half against usc for a 21-7 victory. Usc was the preseason number one team in the country, finished 7-6. In the music city bowl, vanderbilt's jordan rogers connected on two touchdown passes and ran for another, commodores beat north cina state 38-24. Liberty bowl, tulsa's alex singleton scored three touchdowns as the golden hurricane beat iowa state 31-17. 
>>> There are six more bowl games today, starting with the gator bowl. Mississippi state against northwestern. Then it's purdue versus oklahoma state in the heart of dallas bowl. I love these names. They change every year. In the outback bowl, south carolina faces michigan. In the capital one bowl, georgia takes on corn huskers from nebraska. To the rose bowl. Usually the granddaddy of them all. Wisconsin against number six stanford. In the orange bowl, this one has my interest. Because northern illinois is playing 12th ranked florida state. 
>>> In the nfl, not a good day to be a head coach. All the following fired. The eagles' andy reid, chargers norv turner, the bears' lovie smith, that's after a winning record but a bad finish to the year. The browns' pat shurmur. And I'm not done. Also cut loose, chiefs' romeo cornell, bills' chan gailey. The cardinals' ken whisenhunt. Worth noting -- the jets' rex ryan survived the day. 

[00:18:24]


>>> At the annual car jumping championship in england, drivers used a ramp to try to fly over ten wrecked cars and land on the other side. Most of the fearless competitors weren't even close. Not like they're really trying. 
>>> Just ahead, keeping up with the kardashians is about to get a ratings bump. Wish I wrote that but I didn't. 
>>> While we don't condone wasting food, check out this fruitcake toss. Details next. You're watching "first look" on MSNBC.sity understands ER wait times are longer than ever. Nurses are dealing with a wider range of issues. And there are ever-changing regulations. When you see these challenges, do you want to back away or take charge? With a degree in the field of healthcare or nursing from Capella University, you'll have the knowledge to advance your career while making a difference in the lives of patients. Let's get started at capella.edu. flo? is? Are you flo? Yes. Is this the thing you gave my husband? Well, yeah, yes. The "name your price" tool. You tell us the price you want to pay, and we give you a range of options to choose from. Careful, though -- that kind of power can go to your head. That explains a lot. Yo, buddy! I got this. Gimme one, gimme one, gimme one! The power of the "name your price" tool. Only from progressive. 

[00:21:27]


>>> Congress won't win any awards for public service this year, but recipients of the congressional medal of honor are another story. They remind us what it means to serve our country. In war, yes. Also at home and every day of their lives. Nbc's mike taibbi has the story of two veterans who are passing along hard-won lessons to a new generation. 
>> Reporter: At first blush it wasn't much of a parade. A couple of hundred yards, a crowd just a few deep along the way. And two old soldiers the honored guests. 
>> We are proud of you! 
>> Reporter: Perhaps no one deserves a parade more. Major general pat brady and lieutenant colonel bruce crandall recipients of the congressional medal of honor. The nation's high els salute. For both men, both helicopter evac pilots, vietnam was their war. Brady saving more than 60 wounded in one day of pure hell in 1968. And crandall, three years earlier, braving enemy fire on 22 straight missions. The stories celebrated in the hollywood film "we were soldiers." 
>> Medevac command, are you inbound? 
>> Reporter: Today the men are on a new mission as part of the congressional medal of honor foundation's character development program that's now touched down in 44 states. A free lesson plan for schools like this one in acton, california, that trains teachers how to translate the values learned a half century ago in combat to today's youth.

>> Good one.

>>> Live from center city in philadelphia this is "fox 29 news" at 10:00. ???????????? 
>> new developments on the fiscal cliff. The house of representatives is about to vote. As the deal that could keep more money in your paycheck takes more twists and turns tonight. Final vote is expected within the hour. We're keeping our eyes on the house chamber in dc. The showers voting on the senate approved plan. They voted in the early hours of 2013 on the deal struck with the white house. It will increase taxes for americans making more than $400,000 or families making $450,000. But taxes on all other americans will stay current rates watch will happen is anyone's guess with some republicans leaders say they simply cannot support the bill. Fox's joanne pileggi has the latest. 

[00:02:05]


>> Reporter: If it doesn't, if the house doesn't pass a bipartisan senate bill to avoid the worst effects of the so-call fiscal cliff -- 
>> taxes will be going up on everybody in america. If we don't act. 
>> Reporter: Major sticking point for the republicans. The deal passed by the senate early this morning includes $620 billion in new tax hikes. Mostly aimed at high-earning taxpayers and only 15 billion in spending cuts. 
>> Many of the republicans did not want to vote on this and wanted to amend the bill. But I think that cooler heads are going to prevail. 
>> Reporter: Members of the gop leadership had considered amending the bill adding in spending cuts, passing it and sending it back to the senate which has adjourned for the 11 live term. 
>> It's too late in the game. There's a point in a deal where it's done. And if you keep trying to tinker with it to make it perfect, then the deal falls apart. 
>> I think that if we don't have a deal passed, and signed by the president sometime tonight, then there's a real danger of negative impact on the economy. 
>> Reporter: Former house member now in the senate toll his republican colleagues they should pass the current bill. 
>> If we don't get this tax rate problem fixed for all americans, the economy is going to collapse the stock market is going to go down. The defense department will become unraveled. We're going to get blamed. 
>> Reporter: Joanne pileggi, "fox 29 news". 
>> Again, the house is ready to vote. We're looking at a live picture and we're going to check back on washington as events develop in congress. 
>>> Meantime the search is on for the driver who struck a man in wynnefield heights and left him to die. A 50 year old husband and father killed on his way home in the early hours of new year's day. Police say patrick coil was hit at city avenue and presidential boulevard. "Fox 29"'s chris o'connell spoke with his family. He's live in wynnefield heights tonight. Chris? 
>> Reporter: Lauren, about 2:45 this morning when patrick coyle was crossing the road here at city of a trying to get home early this morning when he was mowed down by a driver who just kept going. Tonight his family and police are trying for your help to catch that driver. 

[00:04:22]


>> To drive off like that, you're a coward. 
>> Reporter: Patrick coyle's cousin with strong words for the driver who left the scene leaving the if you have 50 year old dead. 
>> He was always there to make you laugh and cared about everybody and made sure everybody was okay.

>> Loved his kids. All he talked about and bragged about was his kids. How much he loved them and want ed them to do good in life. 
>> Reporter: Coil w walking home crossing city avenue when he was hit and killed instantly. The driver never stopped. 
>> We're speechless. Like I don't understand how somebody can just hit somebody and drive away. I mean, he was right outside of his apartment building. It's not like he was just wandering. 
>> Reporter: There are several pedestrian no crossing signs posted at this busy intersection. Regardless, police think someone out there knows the driver or saw something early new year's morning. His cousin with a message directly to that driver. 
>> For to you drive off, just unreal. Just coward. Cowardly to do that. It's just -- it's sad. It really is, and it's sickening, too.

[00:04:09]


>> Police investigate a deadly hit-and-run in the wynnefield heights section of the city. Tonight the victim's family is speaking to fox. Investigators say a car hit a man crossing the street near city avenue and presidential boulevard. The accident happened just before 3:00 o'clock this morning 50 year old patrick coil died at the scene. Police say the char hit him didn't stop and just kept on going. Tonight family members say they can't believe the driver didn't stop. 
>> He just always there to make you laugh and cared about everybody and made sure everybody was okay. 
>> For to you drive off, just unreal. Just coward. Cowardly to do that. And it's just -- it's sad. It really is and it's sickening, too. 
>> At this time police only have a vague description of the car. They say it may be a silver sedan. 
>>> Deadly violence rang in the new year across philadelphia. Three people are dead after three separate shootings. Now the first gunfire erupted just after midnight on the 5600 block of carpenter street in cobbs creek. Police say someone shot a 16 year old boy twice. And he died at the hospital. Police are still looking for the gunman. 
>> Around 2:30 this in the morning police were called to a house on the 1600 block of pratt street in frankford for reports of a shooting there. Police say a 24 year old man was shot once in the head. And he died at the scene. And police have made no arrests in that case.

>> Philadelphia residents you'll want to listen to this story. You may want to read the fine print on your water bill or you could end up paying a hefty price. Here's one homeowner shocking story that you'll see only on fox. 

[00:06:11]


>> It wasn't the christmas gift maryann sparta had hoped for. 
>> Christmas eve december 24th is when I got a letter and a bill from the water company. The bill is for $6,447.18. 
>> Sparta was shocked and confused. Had there been a mistake? The letter also said her meter had not been registering from APRIL 24th, 1998 THROUGH November 14th of this year. That's 14 years. 
>> I'm not a stupid person. But maybe I didn't examine it closely enough. I'm not sure. But after 14 years, I think that people need to be aware some the water department needs to be called out. 
>> Sparta was paying monthly for her surprise but a surprise to her not usage. 
>> It's not like we were lost in the shuffle then got got anything. Every month they received a check for this address for water service. So after 14 years, there's got to be some kind of red flag. 
>>> So we contacted the philadelphia water department. A spokesperson tells "fox 29" a review of records shows sparta had only been paying for service not usage since two to us six. They are investigateing all the way back to 1998. The company also admits they did not catch the error until they installed a new meter in august of this year. The water department also says " we're in the midst of changing batteries to automatic meter readers so that everyone is getting accurate bills. "Sometimes when we go out we're finding more problems like this. 
>> That's little comfort to sparta and not the way she planned to ring in the new year. 
>> I just don't know how they come up with that figure, and i think after all of these years, I know we would owe them something. But I really feel that the water company has to step up and we shouldn't be responsible for that enormous sum. 
>>> Well, sparta's next step is to have a hearing with the water department. 

[00:08:15]


>> It's been nearly three weeks sin the connecticut school massacre and students are preparing to return to class. Starting thursday, students will attend classes in a different building in a nearby town. ON DECEMBER 14th, GUNMAN ADAM Lands is a shot and killed 20 students and six administrators at sandy hook elementary school. He then killed himself. 
>> Some local schools are arming police officers after the recent tragedy in newtown, connecticut. Fox's christine persichette asked marlboro, new jersey, parents what they think about the increaseed security. 
>> Reporter: These schools already have pretty tight security. There are surveillance cameras outside the buildings. The doors are locked in order to get inside you have to use an intercom and once there, your driver's license is scanned. But starting tomorrow, armed police officers will be standing guard. 
>> I think it's a good idea after the shooting up in connecticut. And just to make the kids feel a little bit safer. 
>> Reporter: Rick's daughter goes back to school tomorrow. She's in fourth grade in the marlboro school district which will now have armed police officers inside every school. 
>> It just makes me feel safer, and because I know what happened to the kids. It makes me feel safe. 
>> The schools have surveillance cameras and a lobby guard system where volunteer parents scan the drivers licenses of all visitors 
>> we really have gone passed a time where I can put parents in harms' way. 
>> The superintendent says the school board decided on the armed guards right after the massacre at sandy hook elementary school. But he says having cops with guns in the schools is nothing new. Right now there are two that split their time between all the schools. Starting tomorrow, there will be one in every school the entire day. 
>> There's not -- there's an emotional event to this. I personal val a hard time talking about it and seeing the images. 
>> Reporter: Still, some parents argue this is not the way to go. 
>> Instead we should be getting guns off the street and then this way we won't need the armed guards in the schools. 
>> Reporter: The superintendent tells me the armed officers will only be in the schools for the next three months while they try to figure out if there's a more cost effective way to keep the schools safe. 

[00:10:22]


>>> In marlboro, new jersey, christine persichette, "fox 29 news". 
>> When you watch a sporting event you never know what you might see. So ahead from out of control golf carts to cheerleaders falling down. We're taking a look back at some of the best sports bloopers of 2012. 
>>> With a new year comes new year's resolutions. We want to know what things you plan to change about yourself in 2013. Go to our facebook page, "fox 29" philadelphia and tell us your resolutions. ???????????? ???????????? 

[00:14:08]

[00:16:52]


>> way to end on that note. Hundreds of people braced the cold and take an annual dip in the atlantic ocean. 22nd annual atlantic city polar plunge grew a big proud. They went into the icy atlantic to multiple the ms association of america. Some of the plungers say it's become a new year's day tradition. Scott, what is the water temperature? 
>> The water temperature in atlantic right now are in the low to mid 40s. So it could be a lot worse. So it was cold. But it's not as cold as it could have been. Let's talk a little bit about the weather. Pretty quite here on this new year's day. A lot of cloud cover out there but dry conditions on ultimate doppler right now. I am tracking a disturbance that will stay to our south. You can see the green on the radar through sections of virginia, the carolinas stretching back into the tennessee river valley and parts of the deep south. That moisture moving from west to east will stay to our south. Let's talk about those weather headlines. It was a cloudy and cold start to 2013. Happy new year everyone. As we move into the rest of the week, though, I'm tracking some of the coldest air of the season. Then temperatures rebound by the weekend. Looking at the numbers the high today was 42 degrees. 1 degree above normal. The record for today's date 64 degre set back in 2005. Currently it's 40 degrees in philadelphia. We have 34 in allentown. Good evening. 24 right now in mount pocono. So still hanging on to some seasonable temperatures around parts of the mid atlantic and northeast but look to the north and the west. It's currently 13 degrees in green bay. 22 in chicago. 23 in detroit. Yeah, that colder air will continue to funnel our way. As we go hour by hour, we have the cloud cover around right now but decreasing clouds throughout the overnight and tomorrow morning will mean temperatures will continue to drop. So it's going to be cold one when you wake up tomorrow morning in the city. Temperatures bottom out in the mid 20s. North and west right around 20 degrees. Even colder likely a few teens toward the poconos. So bundle up tonight as well as first thing tomorrow morning, and throughout the day for that matter. High temperatures for tomorrow in philadelphia 36 degrees. So a lot of sunshine out there, but deceptive sunshine. So bundle up for tomorrow and really you'll want to bundle up for the remain of the week. Case in point, thursday 38 degrees for the high temperature. Keep in mine the normal for this time of year is right around 41 degrees. So we'll be below average through friday and then right around average if not a little bit above for the upcoming weekend. But staying dry. Now, as we move in to tuesday, temperatures will be in the upper 40s. We'll be knocking on the door of 50 degrees. We could even have a few low 50s as we move into the middle and latter part of next week. So a roller coaster ride. Below average temperatures right now. Then pretty seasonable temperatures for the weekend and then above average temperatures into the bulk of next week. 

[00:20:07]


>> Happy 2013 to us. Thank you. 
>> Staying dry and no snow for now. We'll take it. 
>>> Not quiet arizona. 
>> Not quiet arizona which is where andy reid might wind up, guys. The eagles are officially in the market for a new head coach and this guy howie roseman will have a huge say in the future of of this entire team. The new role of general manager howie roseman when we come back. ???????????? snapshot progressive, but don't just listen to me. Listen to these happy progressive customers. I plugged in snapshot, and 30 days later, I was saving big on car insurance. With snapshot, I knew what I could save before I switched to progressive. The better I drive, the more I save. I wish our company had something this cool. You're not filming this, are you? Aw! Camera shy. Snapshot from progressive. Test-drive snapshot before you switch. Visit progressive.Com today. ???????????? 

[00:24:18]


>> as andy reid draws closer tow that arizona cardinals head coaching job the eagles continuing the hunt to replace him. Jeffrey lurie, general manager howie roseman and president don schmolenski will all be involved in the process. It will be lurie who will make the final call but will roseman have certainty to greater say in personnel when the new coach is hired. He absolutely will and the fans about that are very skeptical. 
>> First of all, we're four and 12 so I understand the scepticism went got to get it right and I'm excited about the opportunity to really they started to give me this year in 2012. We're excited about our draft class. I think the process was correct. We took the best players. If we continue to do that we'll build on and get a lot more good players here. 
>> All right. Howie's future eagles college football action today. Plenty of bowl games. Capital one georgia and nebraska georgia trails in the third until this 49 yards to chris connelly the dogs tie it at 31. They had the lead and watch how ridiculously easy this is. Murray to connelly. He goes untouched. 87 yards he might still be running. Georgia comes back with 22 unanswered points. They win the capitol one bowl today over nebraska 45-31. 
>>> Heart of dallas bowl played in dallas. Oklahoma state and perdue and it is a route. 37-yard interception return for the touchdown for oklahoma state. And they're up 48-seven. What do you do? You throw the football any way. Rub it in a little bit guys. Jw walk to web. Oklahoma state in a route 58-14. 
>> How about the gator bowl down in florida. Northwestern and mississippi state. Williams 29-yard interception return for northwestern. Wildcats take the early seven to nothing lead. Twenty two yard touchdown right there. Northwestern wins the gator bowl 34-20. Real quickly to the eagles i thinkhey'll be very patient. I don't think it will be a quick decision. Sounds like andy reid will go ick werely to arizona. They want to get that done. Eagles fans be patient. Take your time on this. Make sure we get the right guy. 90% chance. 95% chance that andy reid gets that job out in arizona. A couple of coordinators that are going to be involved in the playoffs greg with san francisco derk with the atlanta falcon. They have to wait. It might be until after the super bowl before they hire him. 

[00:26:46]


>> That's going to do it for us here at 6:00v a great night. Inside edition is up next.

We saw a lot of cloud cover out there. Fairly quiet conditions on ultimate doppler. A stray flurry toward the northern part of the state earlier in the day. This disturbance to our south bringing with it the moisture around the tennessee river valley that. Will stay to our south. So expect dry conditions for the rest of your new year's day and also turning colder. Let's talk about the weather headlines. Cloudy and cold start to 2013. Happy new year. As we focus in on the rest of the week some of the coldest air of the season ahead and then by the upcoming weekend, more seasonable temperatures. In fact, a little bit of a warmup. The high today 42 degrees. 1 degree above where we should be. In 2005 the record high was 64 degrees. It's currently 40 in philadelphia as well as at the atlantic city airport. We have 34 degrees in allentown. Good evening, and mount pocono checking in at 24 degrees. You factor in the wind, how your body reacts, how you need to dress, it feels like 32 degrees in trenton. It feels like 36 in dover. It feels like upper 20s in lancaster in the teens is what it feels like in the poconos. So 40 right now in philadelp but take a look to our north and west. It is currently 12 degrees in minneapolis. We have 22 right now in chicago. Freezing in cincinnati. So some of this colder air will continue to funnel toward the heart of the delaware valley. It's not going to be in the teens for highs, but feels like temperatures will certainly be in the teens as we move into the rest of the week. So decreasing cloud cover from north to south as we go hour by hour tonight and during the day tomorrow we'll actually see a lot of sunshine, but it will be deceptive sunshine bee of the high temperatures. So for tonight, in the city temperatures bottom out in the mid 20s, but for the colder suburbs, we'll look at temperatures right around 20 degrees. In fact as we move into sections of the poconos, those temperatures will dip into the teens. Because of the decreasing cloud cover. Look at the high temperature expected for tomorrow. 36 degrees. Mostly sunny skies. But deceptive sunshine. So bundle up, dress in layers. It will be a cold day as we move into the middle part of the week. Let's talk about the latter part of the week, because we'll keep those temperatures in the 30s. 38 degrees for the high temperature on thursday. Dry and cold. January chill continues into your friday. But, not as cold as we move into the upcoming weekend. Temperatures more seasonable in the low 40s and then as we move into next tuesday, I'm looking at some of the models right now. Much milder conditions. So a bit of a roller coaster riill be -- we'll be below average and then average and then way above average as we move into next week. 

[00:51:26]


>> That sounds good. 
>> Right now staying dry.

Eagles players still on the roster still have some questions tonight. 
>> What type of potential we have as a team, um, under coach reid. I feel like he's a good coach. He's a winning coach. I feel like we had a couple bad years and, you know, now he's gone because of them. 
>> That is glorified players speak. Is there really a lot of potential on this football team. 12 and 20 the last two years says, no, sir it's not an accident. Whoever comes in as head coach has a more than a littl bit of tweaking to do with this football season. Is nick foles an nfl quarterback ? More importantly, is he a quarterback that can win a super bowl? Make the wrong decision on that and this eagles franchise could be in trouble for a long time. Among the list of candidates a couple of guys who have a great resume with quarterbacks. Derk cutter the falcons offensive coordinator who has made matt ryan one of the best quarterbacks in football. There's the former temple coach. He worked with andrew luck in indianapolis. Colts are in the playoffs. Pagan know says bruce are a yank is coach. He has a ringing endorsement for bruce arians. 

[00:53:29]

If that happened you'd be lucky. You'd be getting -- you'd be getting a great football coach. 
>>> In case you missed it yesterday six other teams besides the eagles looking for a head coach.The bears, bills, browns, the cardinals, although that could be filled quickly by andy reid. The chargers and chiefs all let go of their coaches yesterday.

The helmet off and everything. This game goes back and forth. Fourth quarter it is south carolina trailing until this. Connor shaw 41 years to sanders. It is the game on tops by five. Michigan comes back. Up by a point. With 11 seconds to go in the game, talk about wide open. Dylan thompson 32 yards to bruce ellington. South carolina and steve spurrier within the out back bowl 33-28 all of this just window dressing for the national championship game next monday. Notre dame and alabama.

=======================================================

>> Good morning everyone. I am patti ann browne. 
>> Happy new year. I am heilders. It is january 1st, 2013. Thank you for watching "fox & friends first". We begin with fox news alert. Shy of the deadline the senate passed a deal to avoid the fiscal cliff. 
>> That goes to the house for a vote. Doug mcelway is live with what it all means. You have been up all night so have i, what do we ha? 
>> Little more than hours after the deadline passed they passed a stopgap fiscal cliff bill that spares the vast majority of americans tax increases. It passed with broad bipartisan support the final vote was 89 yai's 8 nay's. Went to the floor to describe a flawed bill one of the best they could craft given the different priorities over the two parties for the last couple years. 
>> Shouldn't be a model of how we do things but I think we can say we have done some good for the country. We have done some good for the country. We have taken care of the revenue side of this debate. 
>>> Working through the night we have reached a deal with sen more mcconnell. I have said all along the most important priority was protect the middle class families. 
>> It raises tax rates on incomes over 400,000 for individuals 450,000 for couples. It blocks the spending cuts for two months to the military and other government programs. That was a huge concern. It extends unemployment benefits for the long-term jobless for ner year and prevents 20 percent cut in fees for doctors who treat medicare patients and it also prevents a spike in milk prices that would have happened as a result of thepiration of the farm bill. The president read a statement which read in part quote neither democrats and republicans got everything they wanted this is the right thing to do for our country and the house should pass it without delay end quote. Whether this goes as smoothly as the house remains to be seen. There are conservative republicans elected to office on promises to cut government spending. This bill does very little of that. There are 620 billion of new tax hikes only 15 billion in spending cuts. That is not going to be appealing to a lot of house republicans. 

[00:02:46]


>> Doug mcelway reporting live for us. Thank you. 
>>> Joined by chad with a look at what happens. You believe it is not at all certain this bill is going to pass in the house? 
>> Yes. The house speaker and the rest of the republican leader team put out a mixed statement saying they want to review this they want the public to look at this. Somehows speaker john boehner is under no obligation to bring this up. They could bring it up and possibly change it and ping pong it back to the senate. This is far from over. There's a lot to do here. The one plus on this side might be the fact there is so muchn this bill doug was talking about it keeps milk prices low the doc fix physicians who see medicaid patients and things. There are a lot of things there a lot of members are for. I have to caution everyone there was a vote december of last year on renewing the payroll tax cut which passed overwhelmingly again a very similar margin in the senate. 89 votes in that particular bill and they move it had over to the house and john boehner and house republicans had a conference call on a saturday afternoon and they got their head handed out. Everybody was mystified by this. They said how can a senate possibly pass a bill with such an overwhelmingly margin and send it over to the house and have such trouble. 
>>> The whole social security tax issue is a big sort of hidden tax. Right now it would be in effect for all income tax levels. There's a 2 percent cut in the social security payroll cut. What this means is someone who makes about 50,000 dollars a year about a,$000 less to spend this year. This is the kind of thing it seems like the house would really object to. 

[00:04:54]


>> Not only that but also the spending cuts, these conservatives in the house tea party loyalists they want deeper cuts. It was something they haven't gotten nearly as far as they would hope. There's something in this bill that would go around. Maybe if they didn't want to vote for it they said I voted for it because of milk the he is 
-- the estate tax. 
>> Then there was a big compromise on the tax pill it raises rates on individuals making 400,000 a year and households making 450. Their income tax would go from 39 percent to 39.6 and capitol gains tax goes from 15 percent to 20 percent. Some house republicans say it is going to stifle the economy. 
>> Ther the republicans wanted a higher threshold. They wanted it to go up to those who made a million dollars. Those making above a million would see tax hike. There are people there who are going to look at that and say i don't like that it's a tax hike for a lot of people. The president did come up with the level that he had initial stlabed 200 to 250,000 dollars. This is legislating you have to compromise. That's what they who to do here. 
>> Chad thank you so much. 
>>> Any time. 
>> Time now for your 5@5:00. The top five making news for you at this hour. Two people gunned down in the middle of new year's celebrations in sacramento, california. A fight broke out and spilled into the streets. The area pause packed for a fireworks display. Three others were injured.

They were tipped off after another couple who met them saw the items in their home. 
>>> A report says the white house should have said the benghazi attack in benghazi was tearrism. A group criticized the president for inconsistent explanations. It was t fbi, cia and other agencies made changes to the talking points on the attack not the white house.

>> How the crews will tackle that cleanup. Happy new year, robert. 
>> Same to you. Good morning everyone. I tell you what, every year it's a small miracle what these department of sanitation workers can do out here. Right after the ball drops they hit the streets and they start cleaning up some of that confetti you spoke about. You can see 2013 up there on the big monitor. Some of the crews cleaning up along broadway. You look at some stretches of road out here you wouldn't even know there was the biggest party in the world a few hours ago. As soon as the ball dropped the crews hit the streets. About a million people packed times square to hear performances from artists includangham stale and tailor swift. Happy new year toou both. 
>> Happy new year. We are kicking off the new year with freezing temperatures. For your first degree weather update we return to janice dean. Happy new year to you. 
>> Happy new year. A cold start to the new year in a lot of places. Look at the current temperatures minus 1 in indianapolis 8 in rapid city. Crews clean up 7 in denver even 45 in los angeles. Cool for a lot of folks. We have a storm system a weak storm system moving through the ohio river valley pushing across the southeast. Mainly a raiven vent as head -- rain event as you head t-- alabama. A calm forecast for most. You have the snow, 37 for us in new york city. 17 in far go. Quiet day looking at leftover snow across the northern roies and central plains. Back to you. 

[00:12:04]


>>> Happy new year, thanks. The time 12 minutes after the hour the senate voted to de dmriens see questions tore bill. What does it mean for national security. Ool ool why you may no longer be able to find a certain bulb the next time you go shopping. 14 after the hour. Some quick headlines. It was a year long pain at the pump for americans that reached an all-time high. 

[00:14:53]


-- Aaa says the gallon of gas was $0.09 higher than the previous record. Bad weather and the tension in the middle east drove the prices up. Lights out for 7 five-watt indan 
-- incandescent bulbs. They can finish clearing out their stock but they will be phased out by energy efficient bulbs. The newer more efficient are more expensive. 
>>> Senatorsable to agree on taxes but not spending cuts. The bill heading to the house does not deal with the defense see questions tore cuts. Instead they delayed on billion dollar spending cut for two months. What does the department of defense need to do between now and then. Asenior fellow for center of 
-- advanced study joins us now. Long night. 
>> That's right. Happy new year. 
>> Happy new year to you, too. Not so much for all of the military members. This delay for two months $109 billion worth of across the board spending cuts for the pentagon and domestic analeses this week. The cost of 24 billion for spending cuts and revenues for converting traditional individual retirement accounts on to roth ira's. Getting into the weeds of it how is this going to effect our military members? 
>> Military members won't see any direct effect. You will see federal employees the sworn civil servants and contractors affected most directly. Right now we are talking about a fwhont kicking the can down the road. With that saidhere was no clear path forward. The pentagon completely blew this off. They were not prepared for anything having to do with the cuts. They did not do budget offsets talking about getting down into the wings. The offsets are those things you can take cuts on and not suffer degradation of options. You can kick that down the road to be funded. Fundamentally we are not seeing a relook or reorganization of the department of defense since 1947. Secretary of defense pineda put out this 5 point opinion piece for the failure of the pentagon to do this. President obama called benghazi a result of sloppy thinking. We have sloppy thinking going on at dod not trying to figure out what is best to do regarding these cuts as well as to make an effective defense. 

[00:17:31]


>> Military pay is exempt from sequestration. The budget analysts yourself expect widespread furloughs of dod civilians to pay for the military operations. 
>> That's right. We are looking at actual cuts and capability. No one thought this through no one thought we should cut the construction costs of expanding military fashion illities. Because the loss is 10 percent across the board that means 10 percent across the board. That we have to do is get it right. Figure out what needs done where these offsets can come from and do the hard things which they didn't do up until now. 
>> That's the question what should be done first because the sequestration calls for 500 billion in defense spending cuts that's about 50 billion annually. Which do you expect to come first what do you think should come first? 
>> You have to look at high-tech programs regarding research and developing. We are way ahead of anybody. You have to look at operationally does it make sense to have this basis forward. You talk about the brac thing depends on national security act of 1947. We won the cold war we need to restructure do things which are effective not expensive. We continue to layer things. Nobody wants to be held accountable regarding making hard decisions to streamline and prepare the defense department for the 21st century. 
>> Thank you for joining us. Appreciate the insight. 19 after the top of the hour. Still ahead a new and explosive warning about laptops and flying. We will explain next. Plus we have all heard of ringing your own beverage but ring your own pot that's what's happening in one state and dwraes legal.

This is a spot between the brain and right ear. It did not result in stroke or neurological damage.

I don't know how but hillary is certainly nobody that puts their feet up she is always been a doer and has enormous respe from everybody and anybody. The 65-year-old clinton is treated with blood thinners and will be released from the hospital once the medication dose has been established according to her doctors. She is in good spirits engaging with her family p and her staff.

>> Good morning I am heather cheryleds. 
>> I am patti ann browne. 
>> Thank you for watchg fox and friends first. The white house and congressional leaders reaching a deal that would avoid the fiscal cliff just ahead of the new year deadline. 
>> The senate passed it it now goes to the house and doug mcelway is in washington, d.C. To break it all down for us. Good morning again, doug. 
>> This margin of victory was a surprise to many it passed overwhelmingly 89 to 8 in the senate. Shortly after the vote was taken th leaders took to the floor to describe a flawed bill. One that was the best we could achieve in such a polarized political atmosphere. 
>> Middle class families will wake up today to the assurance their taxes won't go up $2,200 each. They have a plan how they played for groceries car payments all during next year.

>> They do little for a bigger victory against democrats. I am willing to do it but tonight's agreement ensures that going forward we will continue to reduce the deficit through a combination of spending cuts to revenues through the wealthiest americans. The bill moves on to the how is that must pass it before wednesday the third of january when it 114th senate will pass a higher bill. 

[00:30:49]


>> What else is in the bill, dog? Doug? 
>> It raises tax rates on 400,000 for individuals 450 per couples. It blocks spending cuts for two months for military government payment for people in the military and defense related programs people associated with that are breathing a big sigh of relief it extends unemployment benefits for long-term jobless for ner year. It preventses 20 percent cuts in fees for doctors with medicare patients and would help with a sniek gas prices with the expiration of the farm bill. That's all good news. 
>>> I wanted to ask you one more thing about the spending cuts. We heard mcconnell saying that will be expressed in the fewer. Is there guarantee that will happen? We are looking at a 41 percent ratio. It can happen all they want there will be progress undoubtedly in that regard. I don't see it moving into the senate and certainly nothing the president seems to have said indicates he's much interested in this either. So it could be something that passes in the house than in the house. 
>> Doug mcelway reporting live from washington. Now for your 5@5:30. The top five stories making news at this hour. The good news the senate has approved the fiscal cliff deal the bad news taxes are going up regardless thanks to obama care. Five new taxes due to obama care will start going into effect.

Coming up with the new year comes a slew of new laws including some that are sure to raise an eyebrow. 

[00:38:10]


>> They avoid the fiscal cliff so far but it is far from a done deal in the house. What does it mean for struggling economy? 

[00:40:44]


>> Up first around the world le are ringing in the new year. In shanghai they set it off with fireworks. A whole lot of them. Also a laser light show to showcase tradition and technological advances. Celebrations taking part in due by. Douche lit up the sky and the world's tallest building. Big ben struck 12 in england as well.

>> Wow. 
>> Oo in with the new year out with the old in the big apple. Look at times square with the clean upfrom last night's new year's eve if he is tiffities is still underway. 2,000 pounds of confetti blew through the air after the ball dropped that means a good party but a lot of sweeping up to do.

The ball looked beautiful 2688 waterford crystal triangles lit by led lights there you see the number of the day 2013, january 1st gs, 2013 we are live in times square. 

[00:43:25]


>> A lucky 13. 
>> Yes. The senate passed a bill on the fiscal cliff but does it solve the problem? If the house gives it's stamp of approval what does this peen for the econy? Let's ask the policy maker lynn brooks. 
>> This is a stopgap measure for the tax hikes that take place today. Some of it revisited in a few months. Some parts would be permanent if the house passes it such as the tax rates? 
>> That's right. Ever since 2001 when we first passed this it was temporary. That's why we ar having the cuts now and having it today. It is hard to grow and invest when you don't know what the income tax rate is going to be. You don't know what the debt tax is going to be. This is one positive thing on the bill the spending side is a different story. It's a step in the right direction on tax l but in terms of spending it gets us nowhere in the right direction. Which hit our debt ceiling we will be talking this the next few months. The bill doesn't have a lot of spending cuts into it on balance it increases spending explain some of the areas where it does that. 
>> The big part of the bill where it increases spending is on the emergency unemployment insurance. They decided emergency unemployment would be by the federal government. Since the economy is still struggling they are looking at renewing this. This is new spending in the bill. There is virtually no spending. They got rid of this tweaking the tax code. That is something that a lot of house republicans probably won't like. But at this point in the game i think they have to pass it. 

[00:45:32]


>> One of the increases is social security payroll tax increase. President obama was talking about letting that cut to lapse. It raises income tax for people of all levels on the social security tax to 6.2 percent which adds up to a lot of money for a family. That's a big tax increase. 
>> The payroll tax holiday is going to effect folks. This is a dedicated tax that goes to fund social security. When they took the 2 percent out of social security we were fuing the program through deficit spending. You probably shouldn't be continuing this temporary program for another year when social security has plenty of fiscal challenge of its own. 
>> You sport that move to let that lapse? 
>> I think it's a good policy to let the tax holiday expire. 
>> The tax stays for 400 for individuals 450 for households. It goes 20 percent above that threshold. There are people who say eerie time we raise that capitol gains tax total revenues for capitol gains go down because people cut back investments which hurts the entire economy. What say you? 
>> This is about the art of compromise. When congress waits until the last minute to address aill here we are january 1st and they are addressing a bill that expired last night. 
>> You mentioned the debt kreeging we hit it yesterday. We had security measures in effect. That will put it off for two months. But then we will be right back here at the bargaining table. Our credit rating dropped the last time we had this debt ceiling debate. 

[00:47:52]


>> No question we will be back in two months having this discussion. Credit rating is in trouble. Congress has to look at the spending side. The bill does nothing for spend. That matters to americans because it effects every sij american by having a higher interest rate. It's very important. Both sides were together cooperating and finding a way to cut spending. 
>>> Thank you soichl. So much. 
>> Thank you. Happy new year. 48 after the hour with the new year come a slew of new laws including some that could surprise you such as a ban on letting pigs run wild. Some lawmakers quenching their thirst for regulations with this plastic water bottle ban. We will have more on that. Right now let's check in with brian kilmeade he was coming up on fox and friends. Happy new year. 
>> Same toyou. We are going to go over the next four-hours details on this plan passed by the senate overwell 
-- overwhelmingly. See if it has any hope of passing the house. So far not so good. John will be joining us to look at the financials of this whole deal coming down and put it this way, he doesn't seem happy. Lindsay graham will be here live that will be interesting and how did the deal come together in the last minute? Can you say joe biden and rich mcconnell. We will have details with that get the inside story from chad who has done an incredible job refuse to go sleep for the last 300 days until this deal is done. Will he bring the signed story from where we are headed from here and why is the president so happy and republicans upset. Juliet is here, steve is here. These are her shoes. She only has won. Left foot or right foot. Sweet us now. Back in a moment. : 

[00:53:09]


>> Seven minutes till the top of the hour. 
>> Quick headlines the faa announcing it will inspect 109 boeing 737 airplanes. It comes after a hole tore open the top of a southwest airlines plane mid flight. The inspections could cost $5.2 million. Folks in concorde, massachusetts are saying good-bye to 2012 and to bottled water. A new ban on selling the single serving plastic water bottles went into effect today. It's all part of an effort to cut back on waste. The store is caught selling the bottles face a $50 fine. 
>>> Just a short time ago we range in 2013, but along with the new year comes a slew of new laws and changes. They just went into effect at midnight across the country. Many serious but others are a little bit peculiar. 
>> A host of new laws will take effect across the country. Gay skoums will be able to tie the knot legally. Maryland is the first state south of the mason dixon line to gay marriage legal. Laws in california and illinois are taking effect making it illegal for employers to make workers give access to their pass word protected social networking accounts. Hundreds of thousands will ring in the new year with more money in their paychecks. Most of the pay bumps stay for cost of living adjustments that account for inflation. Washington state will hold the title of the highest minimum wage at $9.19 an hour after the $0.15 new year bump kicks in. No more hogs running wild in kentucky. It will make it ill lael for residents to release ferrell or wild hogs back into the wild.

=======================================================

1, 2013. Happy new year! I'm here for gretchen. Came down to the wire but senators managed to cut a late-night deal to avoid falling off the fiscal cliff. 
>> Shouldn't have taken us this long to come to an agreement and this shouldn't be the model for how we do things around here. 
>> The deal isn't done quite yet. The republican-controlled house next up -- why are you smiling at me? Because you're happy it's a new year? 
>> There is a separate tax hike that goes into effect today. Another trillion dollars thanks to obamacare in new taxes. What it means to you and your wallet coming up. 
>> While lawmakers worked through the night, the rest of america had a little more fun ringing in the new year. 
>> Five, four, three, two, one! 
>> With that, just six urs later, "fox and friends" starts now. Party! 
>> That's the way things began in 2013. 
>> You're looking live, ladies and gentlemen, as the cleanup continues there in the crossroads of the world. Screen right, you can see the toys 'r' us. Then you see a lot of police activity and garbage guys picking up tons and tons of confetti. 
>> I had the privilege of getting in here early and being the only one on the road along with two or three other cabs. We pulled through the tunnel, it was incredible. The same faces I saw at midnight surrounding megyn kelly were the same ones saying when does the more fun start. 

[00:02:00]


>> Don't you get a little nervous wondering are these cops looking at me? 
>> I'm actually cocky about it. I'm thinking this is the time you want to be pulled over. I've got nothing I me. 
>> Especially when we come in to work in the 3:00 hour, you've got to figure everybody on td aside from us may have had one or two egg nogs. 
>> We'll tell you what happened around the world on the new year's eve celebrations. In washington, they didn't ever turn out the lights. 
>> A bit of a hangover. This is a fox news alert. Late last night, early this morning the u.S. Senate approved their fiscal cliff bill. The final tote:89-8. Because the house of representatives has not yet voted on it, ladies and gentlemen, we have technically gone off the cliff. 
>> Right. We do have a framework that the house will be voting on tomorrow, we believe. We can give you some details on that. It is essentially if you want to know, in terms of a ratio 16 billion in tax cuts. 
>> A 41-1 ratio. 
>> That ratio is going to give a lot of republicans heartburn and a lot of americans heartburn. 
>> When you look at history, when ronald reagan agreed to increase taxes, he got $3 worth of tax cuts for every $1 in tax hikes. The tax cuts never came. However -- and this is the ratio right now. As juliet mentioned. 4 # 2-1. 42 in new tax hikes to every dollar in spending cuts. A lot of conservatives do not like that. That is not a good deal t them. 
>> The house has not voted yet. This is going to be in their hands at this point. John boehner is like we've got to look at things. It's not going to happen overnight. 
>> It seems like a couple of weeks ago but it was about a week ago when the house of representatives voted on boehner's plan b which would have set the threshold at $1 million. Now they're going to vote on it at $450,000. You've got to figure a lot of republicans aren't going to go along. 

[00:04:15]


>> What exactly happened? We're going to go over this in detail with chad who saw the play-by-play and was e-mailing us the play-by-play. mitch McConnell called up -- bypassed senator reid who never got back to him on saturday and said can i speak to the vice president, joe biden? We're used to cutting deals together. Like it or not, these are the two that hammered it out. They put it together. When it was all said and done, this is what joe biden had to say about how this deal actually came to fruition. 
>> What was said there was kind of hard to hear. What was your selling point? 
Biden said: Me. It's interesting, the senators, the democrats all got together late yesterday, and joe biden went in, and his pitch to the liberals, particularly liberal liberals was -- quote -- "this is joe biden, and I'm your buddy." He was saying this is the best deal you're going to get. You guys got to go for it, and a majority of the democrats did. 
>> The little smirks and all that, but the fact is he went in there superseding harry reid who wasn't getting anything done. At least something happened. People wanted to see some sort of action. They wanted to know their congressmen who went home for the break would actually do something. 
>> HERE'S mitch McConnell on how this thing went together. He doesn't like the way it happened either but it's still done. 
>> Shouldn't have taken us this long to come to an agreement, and this shouldn't be the model for how we do things around here. I know I can speak for my entire conference when i say we don't think taxes should be going up on anyone, but we all knew that if we did nothing, they would be going up on everyone today. Each of us could spend the rest of the week discussing what a perfect solution would have looked like. But the end result would have been the largest tax increase in american history. So it took an imperfect solution to prevent our constituents from a very real financial pain. 

[00:06:21]


>> As we mentioned at the outset, the final vote in the senate -- remember, it still has to go to the house -- in the senate was 89-8. Those who voted against include democrats tom harkin, a democrat from iowa. Tom carper, democrat from delaware. Mike lee, the republican from utah. Rand paul, republican from kentucky. Richard shelby, republican from alabama. Michael pw epb net, democrat from colorado. Charles grassley, republican from iowa. And marco rubio, republican from florida. Rubio said he couldn't vote for it because two weeks -- years ago he ran on the idea I wanted to be a part of solving the long term problems the country faces. And last night's vote did not do it. 
>> Because of the spending issues. 
>> Exactly. 
>> What we haven't done is outline what was in the deal that passed last night at about 2 a.M. In the morning. 
>> Would you do that. 
>> First off, in terms of the threshold of taxes going up on those horrible successful people who make over $250,000, they can make it up to $400,000 for individuals, $450,000 for couples. It is an increase for republicans but it is a tax on people who are successful and supposed to be the types of people who would hire others. The rate for them goes up from 35% to 39.6%. Call it 40%. When you look at dividends and when you lookt capital gains, it goes up for those people who make over the same amount, although $250,000 is going to lose tax deductions. For those who make over $400,000, if you're making dividends, if you're one of those horrible people able to gather dividend checks, you now are not going to bay 15% tax -- pay 15% tax. You're going to pay a 20% tax. 
>> In the new york city area they were concerned about where's the help for sandy. Sandy relief was not included in this at this point. There is a possibility it can be tagged on in the house later. One other important thing to keep in mind is the sequester. The president wanted to kick the can down the street for a year, but at the end what they decided was that they would put it off for two months. That is going to be a looming debate they're going to have in two months. Also the debt ceiling, technically we ran out of money at midnight but treasury secretary tim geithner figured a way to fin nay -- finnagle the finances where we can run the government through the end of february or early march on the money they've got. Debt ceiling or sequester, two more fights if the republicans want to have. 

[00:09:10]


>> Inheritance tax goes up for people who have over $5 million. The doctors fix will continue for another year. Doctors will be taking medicare patients for at least 365 more days. Unemployment insurance remains at a year. 
>> One thing we need to make sure you understand about all these things we're talking about, these are things that the senate agreed to. The house is going to look at it, and they're going to chew on it, and if they don't like some of it, they're going to amend it and send it back. 
>> We're talking about, like no spending cuts. 
>> Very few. 
>> Let's hear what mitch McCONNELL HAS TO SAY About this. Lots more work to do. We've got to get serious. 
>> Now is time to get serious about reducing washington's out-of-control spending. That's the debate the american people want. It's the debate we'll have next. And it's the debate the republicans are ready for. 
>> Okay. 
>> Is the president ready for it? He says everyone didn't get what they wanted, but what I'm always going to remember about this fiscal cliff is the president's pep rally in the middle of the afternoon yesterday, absolutely surreal. The only thing missing was mitt romney in a debate setting. 
>> We'll hear from charles krauthammer about that. Let's do other headlines, shall we? 
>> Okay. 
>> Countries around the world are ringing in the new year. Vatican city holding a special mass to celebrate watch. 
[Singing] 
>> pope benedict the 16th leading the mass with prayer and singing. The holy ceremony kicked offer at saint peter's basilica in vatican city. A million people packed times square in new york city to ring in the new year. 2,000 pounds of confetti littered times square. The famous water ford crystal ball dropped. In houston, texas, rain did not stop people from heading downtown for performances and fireworks. In baltimore, fireworks lit up inner harbor to welcome 2013. I know you guys were wondering what hugh hefner was doing for the new year. He got himself married to 26-year-old crystal harris. How sweet. Where else but the playboy mansion when the clock struck midnight. This comes a year and a half after the couple was supposed to get hitched, but right before the wedding she broke it off. About a month later those silly kids got back together. We wish them well. 

[00:11:53]


>> If anything changes in the relationship, we will break into the program. The senate cut a deal to solve the fiscal cliff but what are the chances of passing the house? That analysis is next. 
>> There is a completely separate tax hike that goes into effect today. Another $1 trillion thanks to obamacare. What it means for your health and wallet. 
>>> "Fox and friends" live from new york city 2013. 
>> And washington,. ???????????? daughter 18th, five days later, I had a massive heart attack. Bayer aspirin was the first thing the emts gave me. Now, I'm on a bayer aspirin regimen.

[00:14:46]


>> With the u.S. Senate last night in washington passing a solution to the so-called fiscal cliff, it all comes down to what happens next in the house of representatives. President obama issuing a statement this morning saying, juliet? 
>> While neither democrats nor republicans got everyone they wanted, this agreement is the right thing to do with our country and the house should pass it without delay. Is the house likely going to pass it without delay, or pass it period? The chief congressional correspondent for the "washington examiner" joins us now. Good morning, my dear. Thank you very much for waking up early today. We especially appreciate it today. Let's get right to it. What dw you think is going to happen with the house? 
>> They'll gavel in today and they'll discuss the deal. And I think what it will boil down to is a deal that attracts a lot of democrats and some republicans. They need at least two dozen republicans, maybe more, depending on whether they lose a few democrats who don't like that higher tax threshold passed last night in the senate. It's going to be a matter of whether or not these republicans find enough attractive elements in this deal. And they might. They might like the higher tax threshold of $400,000 for singles and $450,000 for couples, the extension of a tax break for those caught in the a.M.T. There's the removal of the medicare reduction payment for doctors known as the doc fix, extended for the next year. There is the estate tax that's been established permanently for folks who -- protectin estates under $5 million. There's a bunch of things in there that might attract republicans. The most important element, I think, if it passes the house that will attract republicans is the fact that this deal does not do anything about the debt limit. Remember, obama really wanted to include a debt ceiling increase at least for a year. That's not in there. So that's a big loss for the president, that nobody's really talking about. What that means is the republicans have another bite at the apple here. The debt ceiling has been reached according to the treasury secretary. What that means is they probably got several more weeks to shuffle around federal money to keep the government operating, but that gives republicans another opportunity to try to force big spending cuts. As a sequester, it's been put off for two months, but in two months they have to come up with another way to make cuts. The president says it won't be all spending cuts but it will be some spending cuts. That gives democrats the chance to do the kind of spending reductions they have been talking about for two years. 

[00:17:19]


>> What the republicans in the u.S. Hou are going to vote on is whether or not to increase taxes on individuals at $400,000 or couples at $450,000. E house rejected it when it was at $1 million with plan b. If the republicans didn't vote for $1 million, why would they settle for $450,000? 
>> They won't. What's going to be different this time is it will be a bill that passes with mostly democratic support. Last time no democrats vote ford this $1 million deal that boehner put through. He couldn't get a majority of his own conference to vote for t. Now we're going to require, there's 192 democrats in the house. They will all have to support this bill or most of them. They'll have to get 26-odd republicans to vote for it. We're looking at the more moderate republicans who will back this bill. Having talked to those republicans, a lot of them are wary about this deal because it doesn't include the big spending cuts they were seeking to sort of justify this tax rate increase. It will be a bit of a cliffhanger going forward see whether they do it today, whether they wait for the new congress on january 3 and whether they can pass this thing at all. I'm leaning toward they'll obably pass it because it's got those attractive elements and lacks the debt ceiling increase. Nothing is for certain at this moment. 
>> Susan, thanks very much once again for joining us today. We'll keep you updated on what's happening here. 
>> In the meantime, washington worked hard into the night, but why did it have to come down to the wire? 
>> Because it's so exciting, providing entertainment for us on new year's eve. 
>>> Lights out. The government pulls the plug on a popular light bulb. The alternative will cost you more. ????????????,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,D match ideas. With a newew project in mind, some how-to knowledge to give us an edge, and more savings down every aisle. it only takes a few twists and turns for those bright ideas to make the New Year even brighter. More saving. More doing. That's the power of The Home Depot. Start fresh and save with HDX 20 Gallon totes, a special buy at just $5.88 a piece. 22 past the hour. Quick headlines. Lights out for 57-watt incandescent light bulbs. The bulbs can no longer be sold but stores can clear out inventories. The bulbs are being phased out for more energy-efficient ones. 

[00:23:01]


>>> A new law in australia is banning ladies' nights. Is it's part of an effort to tackle binge drinking but some bars found a little hole that says if the deal applies to everyone it's okay. So they might be offering drinks to men. 
>> Despite the last-minute deal settled in the u.S. Senate last night, the united states has technically fallen off the fiscal cliff as of now. The house has not voted and the president has not signed anything. Why couldn't washington have solved this problem earlier? They have had it for over a year. Did it have to be pushed to the very last second? I'm joined by debby dingle and ron myer. Does it have to be done like this? 
>> I think all of us would like to see it not done like this, but I think the reality of what the tax increase would be to 100% of americans, I still think we're going to hear a lost static on the house side before you see that vote. It takes coming down to the wire, unfortunately, too much in washington to get the answer to occur. We're only punting. It's going to make march madness a new definition. 
>> The sequester has only been postponed for two months. Does this process bother you, the fact that we got here and so far congressional approval is now down to something like 5%. Wherever you go, people are upset and embarrassed by this. 
>> I think that the house should be pretty embarrassed for how they've negotiated. President obama came out and said he wanted to balance -- the ratio is 41-1 tax hikes to spending cuts. If you think about it, it raises spending because it delays the sequester. We're raising spending and raising taxes. That is a deal senate republicans f comfortable with, but talking with members of the house, they do not have the majority of the g.O.P. Caucus. The g.O.P. Is losing more like 150 votes, at least over 100 conservative votes in the house of representatives if they try to run with this bill. 

[00:25:06]


>> If john boehner wants to be speaker again, he's going to come up for a vote in a couple of weeks. If he gets this passed with a majority of democratic support, he might be no longer speaker. 
>> Absolutely. I think it's one of these things where it depends how hard he whips republicans into it. I think it's one of those cases where republicans in the house are very frustrated and are on the verge of doing that. We've been opting for a new speaker, somebody who can relate better to young people. We'd like to see him replaced. A 41-1 ratio is unacceptable. We have a huge debt crisis and we're not doing anything else about it. 
>> Something else about this process I find fascinating from the sidelines is this was done BY mitch McConnell and vice president joe biden who used to be senator joe biden. There was no harry reid. Can you talk to me about this? 
>> The way things get done in washington is relationships. That's what we all need to do more of, democrats and republicans talking to each other. Those two trusted each other. I think he had a good backup thing going on between senator reid and joe biden. mitch McConnell trusted joe biden. They trust. In washington, your word is something that's very important. They got a deal last night. For the country, I think that was a good thing. 
>> We do know the republicans say it's not a raise on taxes for those who make $250,000. At least it's up to $400,000. They can say the bush tax cuts which everyone knew were going to be sunsetted in ten years, 12 years later 90% of them are in place permanently. Are republicans spinning it and saying those are good things? 
>> I think they are legitimately good things. The fact of the matter is raising taxes on people that hire folks my age and buying products that create jobs is going to do something for our economy. Republicans say why didn't we have a plan earlier that defended those people, defended jobs for young americans, keeping the economy going. This does nothing for the debt, does nothing for spending. We're going to have another cliff in march but we have a greater cliff for our generation. There is a great piece in "the washington times" yesterday outlining that young americans are going to be falling off a cliff either way. We have to do something about it and it has to be soon. Otherwise interest payments will be consuming our income when I get to be barack obama's age. 

[00:27:41]


>> The most frustrating thing is this does not address the problem. If any democrat or republican tells you this would legitimately address a budget that annually is $1 trillion over spending when they're talking about saving less than $1 trillion over ten years is not telling you the truth. Thanks so much. 
>>> Next, secretary of state hillary clinton has a blood clot near her brain. An update on her health when we come back. We've heard of bring your own beverage, but bring your own pot? That's what's happening in one state. And it's legal. ] coughequence?????? #8. baby.

>> The first "fox and friends" for 2013, your new year's edition. Check out the fireworks display in rio. Two million people gathered to see the show, many not wearing much clothes. 
>> Most wearing speedos according to to a recent study by the pew people. Over to dubai where one million people packed downtown for this 35-minute light show. Thousands of tourists flew in to the country just to see it in person. That's cool the way they do that. In london, big ben chimed at midnight and fireworks lit up the sky over the london eye. People started to line the thames river yesterday afternoon. 
>> What happened to shanghai? 
>> Not only did they have fireworks, they had a laser show as well. Weren't fireworks invented in china? Any way, they know how to do them. 
>> Thank you very much. We're up for a special edition of "fox and friends" because of what happened in the senate last night. We're going to keep you updated. WE'VE GOT doug McElway, he's going to give you an update on what happened in about a minute. 
>> I was at disney for the practice for the new year's day celebration on, was it new year's eve or the day before new year's eve, the 30th -- IT'S HARD TO Remember what day it is. That was the most incredible thing. At one point I thought we were being attacked. I believe I was at one of the parks. Magic kingdom. 
>> Two days ago, you don't know where you were? 
>> One day leads to the next. 
>> If it's tuesday, this is "fox and friends." Brian, you're fired. 
>> I did miss monday. The good news is the senate approved a fiscal cliff deal. The bad news is your taxes are going up regardless thanks to obamacare. And if you're over one of those horrible people who make over $400,000. Five new taxes under obama care will start going into effect. Affecting everything from health care costs to the cost of medical devices. The congressional budget office says there is a $1 illion tax hike over the next decade. We're going to talk to one of the guys with medical devices and how they're going to beffected later. 

[00:33:39]


>> Overnight two people gunned down in the middle of new year's celebrations. It happened in sacramento, california. People say a fight broke out in a restaurant and it spilled out into the street. Three other people were injured. Police haven't said if they arrested a shooter or not. 
>> The daughter of a prominent new york city doctor, and he's an occupy wall street organizer, both under arrest for having explosives and a document called a terrorist encyclopedia in their upscale manhattan apartment. 27-year-old morgan glideman is also pregnant and went into labor after being arrested. Her boyfriend, aaron green, is in jail without bail. Cops say they were tipped off by another couple who just met them and saw the items in their home. 
>> That's a whole freaky situation there. 
>> That's not normal. 
>> Secretary of state heubgt -- hillary clinton spending another night in the hospital. A blood clot in her brain discovered during a follow-up exam for a concussion. Doctors are treating her with blood thinners and say she's making excellent progress. She is expected to make a full recovery. 
>> Byop. Colorado opened its first recreational pot club. It's been just a month since pot was legalized this. 
-- Somebody is having a really hard time with this. As soon as the private club was created, hundreds of people signed up. Colorado's pot law prohibits pu smoking. Club goers pay $30. No pot is provided inside. You have to bring your own byop. 
>> In other words, it's potluck. In 2013 that phrase is going to make a come-back. 

[00:35:45]


>> Let's talk a little bit of sports. A lot to go over. It looks like everybody got fired in the nfl and then they decided to leave a few guys there who didn't make the playoffs. Nfl coach or g.M. Is getting let go. I'm talking about seven coaches and five general managers were fired after the last day of the 2012 season. Among! The casualities, the chargers coach, chief's coach and bears coach despite tens wins. Bills, browns and cardinals also let go of their coaches. Some teams wasted no time looking for new men. Foxsports.Com learned the bears and eagleare LOOKING AT mike McCoy. Cardinals are reaching out to andy reid. And the chiefs and eagles and browns are interested in falcons offense coordinator. It was a battle of the tigers and the chick-fil-a bowl. The clemson tigers would score this touchdown with 12 -- from 12 yards out. They would go ton win. They trail by just 2. Let's move on to something with action. Do I have to do a re-creation or do we have that video? We have the video. There we go. I believe the field goal was good. There we go. Clem done got that ball -- clemson got the ball, win the 11th game of the season. The final score was 25-24. That is what's happening in the world of sports. Back to you people. 
>> Continuing kofrpbl of that fox news -- continuing coverage of the senate passing a deal to avoid the fiscal cliff. 
>> The deal is far from done. doug McElway who has not been to bed in about three days is joining us live from the bureau with the very latest. 
>> Not that bad. It was at 10:30 they called me in. I've had no sleep tonight but I'm doing okay. I got to see my wife this morning. You interviewed susan. She was here. 

[00:37:56]


>> That's your wife? 
>> That's your wife. 
>> I was wondering why she came in on a big holiday. 
>> We did our new year's eve kiss a little bit late but it was nice to see her. Final vote in the senate last night, 89 yeas, 8 nays. It passed overwhelmingly in the senate even though senate leader of both parties admitted it was a very imperfect bill. Listen up. 
>> Working through the night and throughout the day we've reached an agreement with senator McCONNELL TO AVERT TAX Increases on middle-class americans. I've said all along our most important priority was to protect middle-class families. This legislation does that. 
>> This shouldn't be the model for how we do things around here, but I think we can say we've done some good for the country. We've done some good for the country. We've taken care of the revenue side of this debate. 
>> That's an important point from mitch McCONNELL. We've taken care of the revenue side but how about the spending cuts? There are very few of them in the bill. There are 620 billion in tax increases but only 15 billion in spending cuts. That's going to be unpalatable for a lot of republicans in the house who believe they were sent to washington with one 
mission: To cut spending. The bill raises tax rates on incomes over $400,000 for individuals and $450,000 for couples. It blocks for two months spending cuts or sequestration to military and government programs. It extends unemployment benefits for the long-term jobless for another year. It prevents a 27% cut in fees for doctors who treat medicare patients, the so-called doc fix. It prevents a spike in milk prices. It raises the tax rate on estates valued over $5 million from 35% to 40%. At 2:38 this morning the president issued a statement which read in part -- quote -- "while neither democrats nor republicans got everything they wanted, this agreement is the right thing to do for our country, and the house should pass it without delay." Keep in mind speaker boehner doesn't even have to bring this bill to the floor if he wants. Republicans have operated under the last several years under the so-called hastert rule where if they don't feel they have a majority of the mority, they generally don't bring bills to the floor. We're going to see if they make an exception for this fiscal cliff bill. As you've heard, some people already this morning, including my wife say there's enough goodies in this for republicans that it probably will pass with a lot of democratic support. You've got this hastert rule in effect, which may allow speaker boehner not to bring it to the floor at all. We shall see in the next couple of days.

>> Doug, I think you're the first washington correspondent we've had on this program who's quoted his wife. 
>> I learn everythinom smart. 
>> We didn't realize your wife is susan ferrichio with the examiner. I looked up on wikipedia. I see not only are you married to her, you have four children and you occasionally play the banjo, bluegrass music at a local tavern. Is that te? That I that is true. I gave it up because this pays better. 
>> The first time wikipedia has been accurate since 1971. 
>> It's the start of a new year. What is 2013 going to hold when it comes to jobs, the economy, my love life. So important. Everybody wants to know that. 
>> That's not on the prompter.

You wouldn't want your doctor doing your jo hello.... So why are you doing hers? Only your doctor can determine if your persistent heartburn is actually something more serious, like acid reflux disease. Over time, stomach acid can damage the lining of your esophagus. For many, prescription nexium not only provides 24-hour heartburn relief, but can also help heal acid-related erosions in the lining of your esophagus. There is risk of bone fracture and low magnesium levels. Side effects may include headache, abdominal pain and diarrhea. Call your doctor right away if you have persistent diarrhea. Other serious stomach conditions may exist. Don't take nexium if you take clopidogrel. Let your doctor do her job. And you do yours. Ask if nexium is right for you. If you can't afford your medication, astrazeneca may be able to help.

>> Got quick headlines from the control room. Talk about sea sick, a noro virus strikes again on a cruise ship in the caribbean. Federal health officials say passengers on the queen mary 2 are suffering stomach and digestive problems. Last week 200 people got sick from the noro virus on a separate ship. 
>> Attention net flix users. Congress passed a bill to share what you watch. Users will have the opportunity to opt in or out of the social sharing feature, which I think is a really good idea.

>> We're all going to be mushy and public displays of affection? 
>> We won't go extreme but it sounds like you don't like that because you're a libra. But seeing each other more is a good thing.

>> We're hours away from the house potentially voting on the senate's fiscal cliff proposal. Our next guest says republicans got a raw deal so far and should have walked away from the one presented. 
>> The editor of real clear markets joins us from our nation's capital. Good morning. In the middle of the night the senate passed this thing. It would raise the threshold on taxes to 450 for a married couple. 
>> Up to almost 40%. 
>> It now goes to the house where a lot of republicans are going wait a minute, we just got reelected a couple of weeks ago and we said we'd never raise taxes. You can't expect us to do that. What's it going to do? 
>> I think they should run from this as fast as they possibly can. This is such a bad deal for the republicans. One of the best things abtheir brand is they have been principled against tax increases. They realize we have a spending problem, not a revenue problem. To then turn around and agree to major tax increases -- and that's what we're talking about in return for nothing in the way of spending cuts -- would be the ultimate in bad deals. 
>> There is almost no spending cuts. The ratio is staggering. There is $620 billion in tax hikes to $15 billion in cuts. Could they be set to fight another day? Two months from now on the debt ceiling and say we' take this deal because on the bush tax cuts, almost all of them stay intact permanently when they were supposed to be sunsetted two years ago. 
>> The beauty of taking this into 2013 is president obama would have to do his state of the union and explain why he could not get a fiscal cliff deal. He would have to explain why he could not get a debt sealing deal. Why republicans didn't use their leverage into 2013 is amazing and hopefulfully they will. I'm watching senator harry REID and McConnell, they're you canning about how this will avoid tax increases on the poor and middle class. It's the exact opposite. There are no jobs and this are no companies without investment first. When you raise taxes on top earners, you by definition lower the earning potential of the poor and middle class. It's a terrible deal for all americans. 

[00:53:46]


>> One thing they have done now, john, is if the house passes this going forward then the democrats will not have that gigantic club of being taoeubl say republicans are sticking up for millionaires and billionaires, people who make over $400,000. That would be removed from the equation and then you could get down to some spending and entitlement reforms, which is really what the republican party wants to do. 
>> Does the republican party want to be the party that says to the most productive, the fred smith of fedex, the late steve jobs that if you achieve, if you try something great commercially that improves our lives and employs us, we're going to penalize you for doing it I don't think that should the message for the republican party. Kweupbdz -- republicans are supposed to be about growth and enterprise. This is them saying the opposite. 
>> You've got people saying there was a lost growth during the clinton years and the top rate, was that 3 9%? 
>> I would say if you give us all we had during the clinton years we would take 39% but you wouldn't take it when the dollar is in free fall. This is a very bad deal. It's antigrowth. The last thing you want to do in a struggling economy is raise the penalty on work for the most productive. 
>> What about the dividends going up from 15% to 20% from those who make that horrible rate of $400,000? 
>> It's another negative signal. When you raise the tax on dividends you reduce the process whereby limited capital can get to new businesses. This is another antigrowth provision. It's telling those who have got the money to invest in new ideas that we're going to penalize you for doing it. 
>> You must think it is delicious irony that the democrats who for so many years have demonized george bush's tax cuts, they are now permanent if this plan goes forward for 98% of americans. Now they love it. 

[00:55:57]


>> Isn't that interesting how the whole time they did not want these tax cuts and now they say they're essential for the future of the economy. The republicans should not go for this. This is such a bad deal. This is a very quick run to the minority status if they go for this bill, I think. 
>> Let's find out. They're going to get together this afternoon. Will they bring it up? Don't know yet. John looked at this bill at 3 in the morning. Thanks so much. 
>> Thank you. Happy new year. 
>> Have u had enough of the fiscal cliff? That phrase, one of the many that americans want banned in this new year. Wait until you hear what else is on that list.

>> Juliet: Good morning, everybody. Today is tuesday, january 1. It's 2013. Happy new year, everybody. I'm juliet huddy in for gretchen. It was down to the requirement last night so many things happened, lawmakers missing the midnight deadline u about they did cut a fiscal cliff deal in the overnight hours. 
>> Shouldn't have taken us this long to come to an agreement and this shouldn't be the model for how we do things around here. 
>> Juliet: We'll break down the details. 
>> Brian: I'm going to talk now. We're not out of the woods yet because the republican house still has to vote, so does it have a chance at passing? We'll find out in a few minutes. That's washington. 
>> Steve: Are you sick of kick the can down the road? That expression? We have a spoiler alert. First you have to check some things off your bucket list. Do you hate those expressions in you're not alone. What these phrases have in common with the fiscal cliff. They could all be going away. "Fox & friends" hour two for the first tuesday of 2013 starts right now. ?????? 
>> Juliet: Have you guys been down there in times square? 
>> Brian: Yeah. 
>> Juliet: You've seen this before, it's like a miracle. It's a miracle. 
>> Brian: Right. That's what new york is great at. Having big party and cleaning it up so we can have another party. 
>> Steve: I think that's the first time I heard she daisy. 
>> Brian: Right. In 2013, there's a lot of music I haven't heard yet. 
>> Steve: We just showed you the clean-up there in times square. Maybe we'll show you how they dropped the ball. This is some of the actual confetti. 
>> Brian: Can you lift it up to see it dates back to yesterday? 

[01:01:15]


>> Steve: It's all over the lobby. You can get your own. 
>> Brian: Okay fine. I'm a little skeptical. 
>> Juliet: During one of the commercial breaks, they were playing a song and I did not think mr. Square would know, but you did. 
>> Brian: What was the song? Pit bull. You now I have to tell you that the audio technician told me. I was close for an hour. 
>> Steve: Let's get to the fox news alert. Just shy of that midnight deadline, the senate passed a deal to avoid that so-called fiscal cliff. Now it heads to the house. We don't know how the house is going to vote. We don't even know if they're going to take it up today. 
>> Brian: So far the indications are not too positive. Here to break it down, wendell goler has been scramble to do give us the first update for 2013? Is that true? 
>> The deal they passed about 2:00 o'clock this morning makes the bush era tax cuts permanent for families making less than $450,000 a year. They're permanent because it passed by a more than two-thirds majority. That's wider than president bush was able to come up with in 1991 and '93. Only five republicans and three democrats voted against the measure this morning. That could make it easier for house republicans to go along. But the deal doesn't contain any spending cuts. Vice president biden who worked out the deal with senate minority McConnell wouldn't predict how the house will go. 
>> It surely shouldn't predict how the house will go. I feel very good. Happy new year, and I will see you all maybe tomorrow. 
>> The deal provides another year of extended unemployment benefits. Democrats had insisted on that since people are spending such a long time looking for new jobs. It raises the value of a state's protected from the death tax, permanently indexes the alternative minimum tax for inflation, but payroll taxes are going back up. SPA IN the McConnell said it was a compromise and not a very pretty one. 

[01:03:21]


>> It has taken this long to come to an agreement and this shouldn't be the model for how we do things around here action but I apprecie the vice president's willingness to get this done for the country. I know I can speak for my entire conference when I say we don't think taxes should be going up on anyone. 
>> It's still not clear if the house will vote on the deal today or if it will pass given that house republicans believe so fervently the nation's problem is spending, not revenue. President obama released a statement this morning saying, quote, this agreement is the right thing to do for our country and the house should pass it without delay. He promises to do more to reduce the deficit. That fight like low to begin within weeks as republicans demand spending cuts in exchange for raising the debt ceiling. Juliet, brian, steve, happy new year. 
>> Steve: Thank you very much. I believe this could be the very first live shot from the white house. Wendell, technically, because the house has not yet passed it, technically we've sailed off the cliff, right? 
>> We are off the cliff now. You feel you're in free fall? 
>> Steve: A little bit. Thank you, sir. 
>> Juliet: Thanks. Congratulations on the first live shot. 
>> Steve: Indeed. 
>> Brian: What is in this bill? As wendell just said, receipts go over a few things. Taxes do go up for singles, individuals who make 400,000 and above. For couples who make 450,000 and above. Dividend and capital gains taxes rise from 15% to 20%. You happen to die, you are going to be given up 40% if your estate is worth more than 5 millioinstead of 35%. Unemployment benefit remain at one year instead of six months. 
>> Steve: Keep in mind, john boehner brought up his plan b a week or two ago and it was -- it set the limit at a million. That was voted down. So now there are a lot of conservatives who say, wait a minute. You're still at 450. They probably should have taken the million, but that ship has sailed. But a lot of conservatives are looking at the gigantic amount of tax increases compared to the number of cuts if you look at it, it raises new revenues and $15 billion in spending cuts, that is a ratio of 41 to 1. In other words, for every 1 dollar in spending cuts, they raised $41 in new tax hikes and that is not good for a lot of conservatives who say where is the sweet spot in there for us? Susan, with the washington examiner says ultimately she feels this could be a loss for president obama because included in this deal that has passed the senate there is nothing about the debt limit, which did he want. 

[01:06:12]


>> Most important element, i think, that, if it passes the house that will attract republicans, is the fact that this deal does not do anything about the debt limit. Remember, obama reall5 wanted to include a debt ceiling increase, at least for a year. That's not in there. So that's a big lossor the president, but nobody is really talking about. 
>> Juliet: So mcconnell says we have to get serious about spending. But one of the other things is this sequestration issue was a big issue. So there will be a couple more months for folks to figure out, for lawmakers to figure out what to do with that. 
>> Steve: And kick that down the road. That can down the road. And technically, I believe we ran out of money at midnight, but they're rejiggering things at the treasury department so the debt ceiling, looks like they'll have that fight at the end of february or march. Those are two things that the republicans may say, I'm coming up short on this deal, they have much more leverage in upcoming spending cut talks. 
>> Brian: We're going to have another cliff, another deadline. It will go to the brink. You can be sure. We'll find out who has the leverage. The huffington post leans way left says leverage lost. Criticized the president and the democratic party for not using their leverage to get everything they wanted. Ron myer who joined us earlier, part of a conservative group in washington says he's heard directly from senior gop members in the house that speaker boehner does not have a majority of support from the gop caucus, not even close. So does he put it up if he's promised democrats will join the republicans that support it and pass it? And risk not being speaker again? So there is going to a lot on the line or do the republicans and the house say, yeah, I'll pass this if you add this and this and do they have to reconvene and I guess amend this? 
>> Steve: Exactly. Remember, this was simply passed by the senate. We have bicameral form of government where it has to go to the house. If they don't like it -- 

[01:08:14]


>> Brian: Nancy pelosi is on record saying she supports it. So that means democrats would line up behind her. 
>> Steve: While republicans are unhappy it's at 450,000, they don't want to raise taxes on anybody. There are a lot of democrats, liberal democrats, upset that it's not at 250. ESSENTIALLY mitch McConnell wound up getting double what the president asked for. 
>> Juliet: I was going to say, when you saw they worked through the night. When you saw the reaction after they cut this deal, vice president biden, who did go in and get something done, was really kind of saying, yeah, I'm taking credit for it. Did he step in over harry reid, WORKED WITH mitch McConnell, made things happen. Is this something to be cheering about and something to be gaffying about? I don't know. Not a lot is happening. 
>> Brian: I saw gallup said the president lost five points in popularity since this whole fiscal legal thing was trying to be hatched. I imagine they're going to drop more when they look at his ridiculous press conference yesterday afternoon when which no benefit, I don't know who had any benefit from him moc congress and how he's going to be here for four years whether you want him torino I didn't understand whe that was coming from and who he was addressing. 
>> Steve: It seemed like it was a really dumb thing to do. In fact, it seemed like it derailed the talks when he was there in the eisenhower executive office building and the one thing ha we haven't really touched on this morning that was contained in his comments is he wants more tax hikes next year. Forget about what may be going through the house and becoming law with this fiscal cliff thing today. He wants more tax hikes next year. 
>> Juliet: America wants to hear about the spending cuts. Let's get to some of the other stories makes news. Lots of energy in times square last night as people rang in the new year. About a million people were in time square. They watched that famous waterford crystal ball drop as confetti and fireworks filled the air. Moving over to vegas, lots of revellers along the strip in vegas as fireworks went off from eight different roof tops. Live music throughout the city. 

[01:10:36]


>> Steve: That's cool. 
>> Juliet: Seattle, fireworks lit up the space needle. Over 60,000 people packed downtown there. Take a look at this terrifying scene here. A helicopter trying to rescue a stranded -- 
>> Steve: Oh, my goodness. 
>> Juliet: This happened atriy de janiero. All four people managed to make it out okay. The swimmer who was in distress was saved by nearby surfer. Wow. 
>>> It was a yearlong pain at the pump for americans that reached an all-time high. Triple a says the national average for a gallon of gas in 2012 was 9 cents higher than the previous record of 3.60 in 2011. Experts say bad weather and the tension in the middle east drove the prices up. 2012 is out and with it goes some of the most overused played out, annoying cliche phrases in the history of words. A list has been reloosed by lake superior state university of phrases from 2012 that should be banned from the english language. Fiscal cliff, good luck on that. Spoiler alert. Bucket list, trending. And yolo, the acrow number meaning -- I never heard that. 
>> Steve: My kids say that all the time. 
>> Brian: What does it mean? 
>> Steve: You only live once. Yolo. 
>> Brian: Really? Ban ago phrase I never heard. 
>> Steve:12 minutes after the top of the hour on this tuesday. Coming up, the fiscal cliff, i know we're -- we're supposed to stop using the word. Not only the only word on americans' minds, today more. Today we'll meet a guy who says he may have to lay off workers because of the obama taxes.

[01:15:05]


>> Steve: How ominous. Today a new tax takes effect that you might not know about as part of the president's massive health care overhaul that passed a couple of years ago. It takes effect today. It is a 2.3% tax on the sale of all medical devices. 
>> Juliet: We probably do know about it if you've been watching fox news channel because we've been following our next guest's story. While that might help raise $30 billion, there arrest lot of critics and peter cash could come at the expense of good paying acan jobs. We're j by andre, the president of adm electronics, a family owned mal device company in new jersey. You guys have 19 employees. For the first time you actually are thinking you may have to lay people off. Tell us why you're in that position at this point. 
>> Unfortunately, this is a totally discriminatory tax just on the medical device industry and it's a top line tax. It's on growth, regardless of whether or not you're making a profit, it's on the top line. Therefore, it's an ill conceived tax because this is an industry which is innovative, has a loft good paying jobs and I just can't think of a worst thing you can do to a manufacturing industry in this country. 
>> Steve: Absolutely. As we take a look at some gizmos right there, people think, oh, medical devices. That's probably what, a heart transplant device and artificial knees? No. We're talking what? 
>> It goes all the way from tongue depressors to mri machines or like what we produce, medical electronics that are used for diagnostic, as well as therapeutic purposes. So it's a whole array of products that are now going to be penalized with the only excise tax that's in this obama bill. 
>> Steve: It hits the fan today. They kicked the can down to today and it hits the fan today. 
>> When you talk about happy new year. This is tax day for us in our industry. It hits the entire medical device industry for the biggest companies to smallest. The industry, over 2 million jobs are supported and 80% of those jobs are in companies with 50 employees or less. So it's a small innovative industry. 
>> Juliet: You have 19 employees and now they're working with you. They're not upset with you. But they're trying to work with you. What are some of the things they're doing to sacrifice? 

[01:17:11]


>> We're like family, it's a small company. For example, for christmas instead of taking christmas bonuses, we gave them the week off in between christmas and new year, just so that could help out financially. 
iet: YOU HAVEN'T TAKEN A Paycheck in a while? 
>> You do what you have to do. We want to keep o people working and trying to find our ways. We're experts in medical device and trying to find other things. It's not just me. There are over 40,000 jobs being lost because of this new tax. 
>> Steve: It's one of those things where with some taxes where you think okay. If I spend this, I would be taxed some and I'll put that off. With medical devices and medical necessity, it's not like you think maybe I should put that mri off, you have to have it right then. 
>> That's right. It would hurt the people in need the most. When you talk about a tax increase, this is a tax increase on the people that need t services and also for our industry, this is just another thing that we have to deal with. We're already dealing with foreign competition, with much lower tax rates than other countries. So this is just another hurdle we have to get over. It's a very difficult situation. 
>> Juliet: Why does the president think this will create jobs? 
>> I heard that argument from president obama and he's just not being realistic. 
>> Juliet: Why? >>E thinks it's going to bring all these people in because all people are covered. The people who need medical devices are older and have medicare. It'she young people coming in. Most people don't wake up and say, you know with a? I'm going to go for an angioplasty. It just doesn't happen. 
>> Steve: Can you come back a year from today and we'll find out how it impacts you? 
>> Be happy to. 
>> Juliet: Let me have some fun. Thank you very much. 
>> Steve: Good luck to you. 
>> Thank you. 
>> Juliet: All righty. Just a short time from now, the house could vote on the senate's fiscal cliff deal. I can't say that anymore? 
>> Steve: No. 
>> Juliet: Okay. Who comes out the winner we'll talk about that next. 
>> Steve: Plus say good-bye to gangam style.

>> Juliet: Welcome back. Happy new year. Yea. Got your news by the number. New year's edition. 2688. That's how many of those sparkling waterford crystal triangles there are covering the times surveyor ball. 2,000. That's how many pounds of confetti rained down from the roof tops on the new york city party goes after the ball dropped. 60 million. That's how many glasses of sparkling wine have been poured this holiday season, likely when the clock struck midnight. Brian, to you. 
>> Brian: Thank you very much. I'll factor in steve as well. Technically america went over the fiscal cliff a couple hours ago, but despite the near crisis, our next guest says the president could come out of this a winner. 
>> Steve: Good morning to you. 
>> Good morning. 
>> Steve: The senate has passed this. Now it goes to the house. We don't know if they're going to take it up today or when. Technically we have sailed off the fiscal cliff. The big question is, what's the house going to do? 
>> I think they're going to pass it. You have to remember the house could not pass plan b, which was john boehner's plan to raise taxes on people who make a million dollars. So how in the world would they pass something that's even less than half that, raise taxes on people before 50? You have to remember, all the attention was paid to those republicans who blocked that planned deal. There is 240 republicans in the house. About 40 of them stopped it, which means there were 200 republicans who were ready to vote for plan b. Some number of those are going to be ready to vote for this. If john boehner adds their votes to the democrats, I mean, the democrats have gotten the okay from president obama to vote for this, it passes the house. 
>> Brian: Here is the thing, does boehner risk not being speaker if he needs democratic votes to pass this and then he goes up for the speaker vote and people say, I'm not voting for you? 
>> You have to go back to the calculation republicans made from the very beginning inhis, which is if there is no deal, taxes go up on everybody. And then in the first day of the session, meaning tomorrow or the next day, president obama then proposes to relower the tax rates for everybody under 250. Then it becomes voting against the obama tax cuts. That was the scenarios rinse were afraid of. 

[01:25:07]


>> Steve: It looks like a republicans say it's a done deal, we'll have to raise taxes on the most successful. But we will live to fight another day. That day is when the debt ceiling comes up in a couple of months and the sequestration thing, they kicked it down -- two months! So the republicans think, okay. When we get down to the talk about spending, we're going to be big winners. 
>> They knew that raising taxes on the wealthy polledbadly for them. Ost americans were in favor of that. We're not on the winning side. They got that off the table and said, we'll win the debt fight. I say to them, well, won't the press just kill you for being the people who would drive the country to the very risk of default in favor of -- to save your spending cuts, which aren't popular in the first place. They feel they can win that fight. I'm a little skeptical. 
>> Brian: In the big picture, if someone told that you there will be a democratic president going on a second term and the bush tax cuts were supposed to evaporate two years ago would be in place, 98% would be in place, I don't think republicans would have thought that would be amazing if a democratic president would be there five years and make most permanent. 
>> I think george w. Bush would think of himself as a winner in this in the sense the democrats opposed these tax cuts back when they were made. Were bitterly against them for most of the time. Now are in favor of most of them. Part of the problem with the republicans is they had made their position, we will not raise taxes on anybody. And president obama has won that fight. 
>> Steve: The president also wanted the threshold at 250. Now if the senate plan goes through, it's at 450. So the republicans were able to win a little more wiggle room. 
>> That's the rincon solation prize. But the other big obama prize is no spending cuts. I mean, a few republicans are going to give in on this position you have held for decades, what are you going to get in return for? Remember that great "wall street journal" article where john boehner says, I'm putting all this revenue on the table. What am I going to get? Barak obama says, you get nothing. I get it for free. That's what hapned. 

[01:27:10]


>> Brian: That's what happened so far. It's amazing because if the president actually wanted to balance the budget, he would be doing cuts. It doesn't seem like he's playing for the same goal as the average american, politics aside. 
>> We have one side that wants higher taxes and one side that wants lower spending. They're banging into each other. 
>> Brian: Thanks for coming in. 
>> Thank you. 
>> Steve: Happy new year. 
>> Brian: Straight ahead, president obama wanted congress to get raises. But most americans think they're doing a very bad job. Will lawmakers see more money in their paychecks? There is an update. 
>> Steve: Kind of a diplomay day in washington. Chances are you watched the times square ball drop. Down south it was all about the peach. We're going to show you how the rest of the country rang in the new year when "fox & friends" rolls on live from new york city 

[01:30:50]


>> Brian: More than a billion people -- okay, a million. Gather to do watch a ball drop in times square. Another part of the country, people rang in the new year with some unusual traditions. Atlanta, it was all about the peach. The 800-pound peach is juicy, has been a tradition since 1989. In orlando, more fruit. Thousands of people gathered to drop the orange. 
>> Juliet: Why are you talking like that? 
>> Brian: This year, not only rang in the new year, but marked the 500th anniversary of florida's discovery of the orange. 
>> Juliet: Yea, to florida. 
>> Brian: We discovered florida. It was just sitting this wide open, all they had was disneyland and no people. 
>> Steve:500 years ago? 
>> Brian: Yep. Magellan wrote all about it. 
>> Steve: Thank you for joining us today, a special "fox & friends" and a special promotion ceremony two minutes away. This will be great. You won't want to miss it. It will make your day. 
>> Juliet: Let's get to some other headlines. She's the daughter of a prominent new york city doctor. He's an occupy wall street organizer. Together they make a wonderful -- no, now they're both under arrest for having explosives in their apartment. 27-year-old morgan is pregnant. She went into labor after she was arrestedders forcing her arraignment to be delayed. Her boyfriend p 1-year-old aaron green is being held without bail. Cops were tipped off by another couple who saw the suspicion items in that couple's apartment. So kind of a strange story. We'll probably update you more on that. 
>>> Minnesota representative michelle bachman introducing legislation to block a planned pay raise for congress. President obama approved the raise last week burks bachman says given the current state of the economy and it doesn't seem like a good idea. In a statement she says, quote, we have a spending problem in our country. We should be looking for areas to cut spending. Several other republican lawmakers are joining her effort to block the raise. The senate's fiscal cliff deal puts the kabash on the pay raises, but has yet to pass the house. 

[01:33:05]


>>> Get ready to say good-bye to gangam style. ?????? The only reason I want to keep it around is because dave just did that dance. That was unbelievable. This dude, korean singer says he's retiring the song at the start of the new year so he can focus on his next big hit. Lord help us all. Steve? 
>> Steve: Let's switch gears. The new year is bringing if a new job for our next guest and an impresssive one to say the least. After nearly 25 years, of military service, he's about to receive the highest enlisted rank in the united states air force. Senior master sergeant scott stoy joins us live. Good morning to you. 
>> Good morning. 
>> Steve: What have you been doing in the air force all these years? 
>> For the first 12 years i worked as a aero ground space and then recruiting. I've gone through the gauntlet of being a recruiter and a flight chief and moved up to squadron level and now the superintendent of active duty recruiting for the state of new york. 
>> Steve: That's awesome. It's good because when you go into the recruiting office and you want to talk to somebody who has been there and doesn't -- it's good to have a guy like you right there behind the desk. 
>> Yes. All of our recruiters have experience. We don't allow recruiters to come right in as a recruit. They have have experience in the air force to at least be a senior airman. 
>> Steve: Right now you are a senior sergeant -- senior staff sergeant. 
>> Senior master sergeant. 
>> Steve: Officially at midnight, you became chief, right? 
>> Yes, sir. 
>> Steve: This is a greatonnor. This only happens to, what, 1%? 1% of the enlisted force. 
>> Steve: Now today for the special day, shane, come on over here. I'd like to introduce you to the chief's son, shane, and right over here, lieutenant meghan stanton with the united states air force. It's all part of the promotion. 

[01:35:15]


>> Yes, sir. 
>> Steve: We will just be flies on the wall. We're going to watch and see how this goes. This is great that his son is able to take part as well. 
>> Absolutely. 
>> Steve: Does it feel like the old one? 
>> A little heavier. 
[ Cheers and applause ] 
>> Steve: Is that a tradition. 
>> It is. 
>> Steve: By just your sons? 
>> Whoever can do one. Sometimes the stripes aren't already on the jacket and they hold it threw and punch them. 
>> Steve: Fantastic. Now you're a chief master sergeant. Highest rank in the air force. Thank you very much. That's a real honor to watch that today. Shane, very nice. And lieutenant stanton. 
>> Yes. 
>> We'll do the oath. 
>> Steve: You're going to do the oath now. All right. 
>> Raise your right hand, i, scott pat trick stoy, do solemnly swear to support and defend the constitution of the united states against all enemies, foreign and domestic, that I will bear true faith and allegiance to the same and i will obey the orders of the president of the united states, and the officers appointed over me, according to regulations and uniformed code of military justice, so help me god. Congratulations. 
>> Thank you. 
[ Applause ] 
>> Steve: Very nice. Thank you for sharing that with us. That was terrific. 
>> Thank you for having us. 
>> Steve: Happy new year. 
>> Happy new year. 
>> Steve: Great way to start new year. 

[01:37:15]


>> Yes, it is. 
>> Steve: All right. Juliet over to you and brian. 
>> Juliet: You can join us over here. Congratulations, guys. 
>> Brian: As we've been talking about the fiscal cliff and the negotiations that went through the final hour, final minute, it was marshalled by senator McCONNELL, AS WELL AS FORMER Senator joe biden. Went back to his old roots and old connections and did something harry reid could not do and it's return a phone call FROM mitch McConnell. After this was passed by the senate overwhelmingly, one of the people that did not vote for it was senator rand paul. He hated the fact that once again it's all about class warfare. Listen. 
>> Campaigned against rich people and you got enough envy whipped up in the country and you're going to stick it to those rich people. The republican party, the party of limited government and low taxation should have no part in this. We should have no fingerprints on this and we should in no way support anything that raises taxes 'cause it's bad economic policy. 
>> Steve: Marco rubio, the senator from florida state, said he couldn't vote for it because he ran two years ago on a platform he wanted to be part of fixing the big problems in this country and what they did yesterday certainly did not do that. Charles krauthammer was on the channel last night where he was talking a little bit about how extraordinarily the president of the united states, in the early afternoon, went in the executive office building, the eisenhower building next to the white house surrendered by middle class taxpayers. 
>> Brian: Supposedly. I don't even know that. 
>> Steve: It was a real cheerleading event t. Seemed like a campaign stop. He had already won. Charles krauthammer says this is astonishing. Watch this. 
>> I found it astonishing. Here he is coming out to speak to the nation at a crucial moment, in very delicate negotiations and he comes out there with incredible arrogance. He spikes the football on the republicans. He rubs in the fact that they were resisting a raise in rates and he made them do it. Of course, there is always he places himself hovering, benignly at an olympian level above the fray where the children are playing in the sand box and he's asking that everybody be reasonable, as if he's just arrived in washington on a tourist visa. 

[01:39:37]


>> Juliet: This went through the senate, but it still has to go through the house. Who knows if that's going to happen? 
>> Brian: I don't know. Was it the part that the vice president was leading the negotiations that they bypassed the white house? senator McCain says here we are and you're trying to tell everyone how above it you are and that you won reelection. I'm going to be president for another four years. The tone, I don't know. I can't think of who would benefit to book those people behind him, book those people to clap in front of him, talk about how he might have to spend new year's eve with some of them in the audience, and then he just leaves. And then they have to go back and we have to find out details of this plan that would pass a couple hours later. 
>> Steve: Bob corker accused the president of essentially heckling congress at that particular press event yesterday afternoon. Charles krauthammer also said last night that when he was running for reelection, the president had to talk about I'm interested in making the significant spending cuts to get us on the right track. Now that he's being reelected, where were the gigantic spending cuts in this deal with the senate? There aren't any. And will he have any going forward? Charles krauthammer is skeptical. 
>> Brian: Here is the thing, if he wanted to balance the budget, anyone looking at the budget knows that you have to have spending cuts. It's not a democrat or republican issue. 
>> Steve: Harry reid has not brought autopsy budget for three years! 
>> Brian: And the president continues to get a pass from the american people on . By the way, the only reason the president got elected because he said mitt romney would destroy the country and was a horrible person who I guess would do everything wrong. He talked about this, but he won because 85% of all his efforts were to denigrating mitt romney. That's how he won. 
>> Juliet: Charles krauthammer made a great point a few days ago. It was four or five days ago. He said right now the president has already won his second term. So he's not out there trying to be mr. Popularity. He's doing things he wants to do for his legacy, whether or not this -- he blows the economy is yet to be seen. But will he be looking back and will we be looking back on this presidency as this whole development, what's happening with the fiscal cliff thing, will it be a positive part of his legacy or not? 

[01:41:40]


>> Steve: The president during the campaign promised I'm going to raise taxes on millionaires and billionaires. Of course, now it was 250. Now it looks like it could be $450,000. But once that argument is taken away from the president, okay, you already did that. Now what? Then we're actually going to have to talk about spending. Does the president really want to do something about spending or is big government in the cards for him? It looks like big government in 2013. 
>> Brian: I have a sense he's unfortunate going to talk about spending in specifics. Coming up straight ahead on this show, everyone wants to know what their future holds in the new year. I don't know. Steve and juliet don't know. But they're going to talk to somebody who does know. 
>> Steve: An astrologer. 
>> Juliet: You don't want to -- you want me to write down a question. 
>> Brian: I think the american people should go first. 
>> Juliet: Absolutely. Plus, some lawmakers quenching their thirst for ban or plastic bottles. Business owners will be paying the price hi. We're spreading the word about honey bunches of oats fruit blends and the unique taste combination like peach/raspberry. With one flavor in the granola bunch and one on the flake. Two flavors.

>> Brian: The state of texas can now cut off funding to planned parenthood. A judge ruled the state does not have to give any money to doctors and clinics that support abortion. Texas already bans using state funds for abortion, but it continued to reimburse planned parenthood for basic health care for women. And people in concorde, massachusetts are saying good-bye to 2012 and to bottled water. New ban on selling the plastic bottles has gone into effect today. 
>>> It's all part of an effort to cut down on waste. Stores selling it face a $50 fine. Juliet? 
>> Juliet: Brian, thank you. With the new year comes new changes to jobs, the economy, your personal life. Who doesn't want to know what the future holds? Here to answer the e-mails you've been sending us all morning, susan miller is back. So I asked last hour to have viewers send in some e-mails and now I will put my spectacles on. An e-mail from amy in new york who says her daughter was born october 10, 1968 at 11:58, queens new york, she's wonderful, but her personal life is miserable. Will 2013 be better for her? 
>> First of all, yes. She's a libra and libras have walked the gauntlet. 
>> Juliet: She's right around mine. 
>> Yeah. I love it that this lads asking about her daughter, she really cares about her. This child is going -- she's not a child, but I'm saying this person is going to change the world and keep going back to school for advanced degrees no matter how old she is. This is a very educated person and wants to know more, is curious about the world. She'll probably meet someone just as educated. Mom shouldn't worry. This child has an aspect similar to george washington and abe lincoln. 
>> Juliet: Whoa! 
>> Warren buffet and bill gates. 
>> Juliet: Amy in new york is stoked. 
>> She's a mover and a shaker. I love this chart. So amy, do not worry. 
>> Juliet: Amy's mom, you need to write back and let us know. You are amy. Write us back and let us know what you think about what she said. Second e-mail, this is kristy in california. Born march 14, 1942, 9:20 a.M., san francisco. My financial situation improve this year? Will I be able to buy a house? 

[01:47:04]


>> I love her question. First of all, pisces, best part of their life is the home. Now, that means buying the house is a perfect idea. Jupiter has been direct t. Goes direct january 30. She will way the house. She needs to get it done by june 25. But there is a beautiful new moon in the beginning of june. So if it runs close to june, don't worry. I say she's getting the house. All pisces thahad problems with money, it's going away. 
>> Juliet: That sounds good. This is e-mail from jackie, mississippi. What should I focus on in 2013, born january 29, 1962. Natchez, mississippi, 1:30 p.M. 
>> Well, jackie has gemini rising. I hope she is in the communication business 'cause she's a brilliant thinker, writer, speaker. She has a whole line - up of planets in aquarius. She could work in politics. She can work on the internet, anything new, electronic, software, telecommunications. She has a brilliant chart. For all those aconveyer young planners -- aconveyerian planners, love, love. I haven't had good things to say for aquarians for a long time. 
>> Juliet: Let's say you were a libra and hoping to have a child in the near future. Will your hopes come alive? 
>> You know, now that jupiter is luck, it's called trying -- the most heavenly aspect you could ever get. So I would urge you to conceive before june 25 'cause jupiter moves. 
>> Juliet: I got to get on it! 
>> You got to get on it. 
>> Juliet: That's good news. 
>> It would be a sweet baby. 
>> Juliet: It would be darling. I'm telling you. Are we going to see you again? 
>> I'm staying here just in case you have time. 
>> Juliet: Okay, good. 
>> I would like the questions to be specific. 

[01:49:05]


>> Juliet: Get more specific, people, if you could. Okay. Thank you very much. 
>> Thank you. 
>> Juliet: You stay right there. We'll take a quick break 'cause you'd be paying $8 for a thrall -- I don't know, could you be? Susan, tell us. The outcome of the dairy cliff is coming up.

>> Steve: The fiscscal cliff as it turns out, we may not be going over the dairy cliff after all. 
>> Brian: The white house and congressional leaders came to a last-minute deal preventing prices of milk from doubling to nearly $8 a gallon. Joining us right now with her reaction is farm owner and board member of the united dairy industry association, audrey donahue. You do not have to work the farm today, but you are relieved. 
>> Yes, we're very relieved. I too,m a consumer. I have to go into the grocery store and purchase milk and dairy products. As a dairy farmer, I was very concerned 'cause we certainly don't want consumers to not continue to buy dairy and dairy products. At that he is a very important part of a diet. We need to have three servings of dairy a at this in everybody's diet. It's very important for our children as well. 
>> Steve: So why was it going to go up to 8 bucks a gallon? 
>> What was going to happen, it was going to go back to some laws that we had in the late 40s which was based on what it cost to produce it. So without having that farm bill go through, that's what we would have done. We'd have gone back to an old law that was enforced. 
>> Steve: What they've done with the so-called dairy cliff, they have kicked the milk can down the road for another year. But that's good for you 'cause it means that prices will not be going up. 
>> Absolutely. It's very good for me. Dairy farmers were very concerned about that. We're kind of going through a stage right now where we don't have the consumers drinking fluid milk like we'd like to see it. They're still consuming dairy products, which is great. We have to have those three servings of dry a day in your diet. They're shifting more towards the cheese and the yogurts and it's so important to grab that glass of milk for a dairy farmer because economically, that's where we make the most money on our farm. We get paid the most for fluid milk. So what have we done? We take great care of our cows, our land, we produce a good wholesome product that's safe and healthy. Now we have to take care of the consumer. So that's exactly what we've done. We've become more innovative. We have really been into the marketplace and we have new products now. We have lactose free milk, low fat, low sugar, flavored milk and that's exactly what we're going to do. What do you want as a consumer? We're going to take care of you and wed into to be more innovative in that marketplace. 

[01:55:07]


>> Brian: What do you say to people like senator harkin who didn't vote for this because he didn't feel like it was addressed to this correctly. There is no long-term answer addressed in this. 
>> No. But we need dairy farmers. It helps the economy as well as it does -- we produce a great product. We help the economy, too. The infrastructure of our business, we do business with a lot of people. We do a lot of business with other people. We have the veterinarians and the feed salesmen and nutritionists, all these people working with our cows and our land. We need farmers. It's an economy booster and providing a very healthy and nutritious product to consumers. It's an american-made product. When you think about a glass of milk, it's an american-made product. It's locally grown, and the essential vitamins in this -- 
>> Steve: It's more american than apple pie with a big glass of milk. 
>> And a slice of cheese, exactly. 
>> Steve: Before you go, you don't live in the washington, d.C. Area or new york city, you're out on a beautiful dairy farm. Looking in on washington, d.C., how it only seems like they get stuff done when they're in the 11th hour. It's frustrating to awful us. Got to be to you as well. 
>> It is very frustrating. I'm a fifth generation dairy farmer. My family has been producing milk for 150 years. I'm very proud to say after my son got done with college this spring, he has come back to the farm. He is a sixth generation dairy farmer. We need us in america. I want to see this continue. I want to see my son stay on the farm. So yes, you're right. They make decisions at the last minute and we don't want that. We want to have dairy farmers stay here for a very long time. 
>> Steve: Sure. 
>> Brian: Thank you very much for joining us. We appreciate you coming down today and from your perspective, we don't get enough from the people that are out there working 20 hours a day to make ends meet. 
>> Thank you very much. 
>> Steve: The thing about a dairy farm is those cows don't go on holiday. So while she is here being on the show this morning, her husband and the son were milking the cow. 

[01:57:12]


>> Brian: The cow saw the show and thought I get the day off. Wrong. Thank you very much. 
>> Thank you very much for inviting me. 
>> Brian: Straight ahead f your child witnessed the sandy hook and survived, should you be able to sue the school for emotional trauma? That debate next hour. 
>> Steve: We've all heard of bring your own beer. Now it's going to be legal to bring your own pot? That's what one state says and aig? going did. 
Woman: We're helping joplin, missouri, come back from a devastating tornado. 
Man: And now we're helping the east coast recover from hurricane sandy. We're a leading global insurance company, based right here in america. We've repaid every dollar america lent us. Everything,plus a profit of more than $22 billion. For the american people. Thank you, america. Helping people recover and rebuild -- that's what we do. Now let's bring on tomorrow.

>> Juliet: Happy new year, everybody. Today is tuesday, january 1. Brian? 2013. Happy new year. I'm juliet huddy in for gretchen. We officially went over the fiscal cliff, but at least senators managed to cut a late night deal. 
>> Shouldn't have taken us this long to come t an agreement and this shouldn't be the model for how we do things. 
>> Juliet: Next stop, republican controlled house. Will they pass the senate's bill? 
>> Steve: Newtown still grieving over the tragic loss of innocent school children and faculty and now a lawyer on behalf of a six-year-old survivor, is looking to sue the state of connecticut for I believe $100 million. This hour, connecticut's attorney general responds. 
>> Brian: All right. Out with the old. In with the new. Millions ringing in 2013 around the world. "Fox & friends" hour three starts now. ?????? . 
>> Four, three, two, one! 
>> Juliet: Gives me chills. 
>> Steve: That's because it was chilly. Queue guy lombardo. Welcome to 2013 brought to you give bitoshiba. 
>> Brian: By the way, the party is still going on. If we can go out there live, it is like -- oh wait a second. They cleaned it up! They opened it up and we're able to drive down broadway just like that! 
>> Juliet: Did you see mayor bloomberg in that last shot with the rockettes? He is just -- just amazed by that. You should see the way he's glowing. Hysterical. 
>> Steve: I got nothing on that. 

[02:01:47]


>> Juliet: I ??now. He's been talking a lot about them lately. He gets all giddy when they come about. Very funny. 
>> Steve: Welcome to 2013 and we start with a fox news alert. Let's talk a little bit about a hangover because last night the people on the senate side of that round building down in washington, d.C. Did pass their version of what they hope will get us through this fiscal cliff. They decided that this was a deal brokered by joe biden and mitch McConnell, the republican. 
>> Brian: What does that say about harry reid who was bypassed? 
>> Steve: Harry reid stopped returning their phone calls. So eventually mitch got on the phone and said to harry, hey, do you mind if I deal with joe biden? I worked with him before. So they came up with this deal which has now passed the senate. It's going to go on to the use. They're going to convene a little later on today. Will they bring it up? Don't know. Will it pass the house? Don'tw that either because there are a lot of republicans who do not like the idea of raising tacks on anybody. 
>> Juliet: Here they are. The taxes rise for singles making over $400,000. Couples earning $450,000. Dividend and capital gapes taxes, those rise 20%. The inheritance tax rises 35 to 40%. Unemployment insurance does remain for a year. 
>> Brian: And there is much more facets to it when you look at dividends and capital gains. It's going to go up from 15%. Because you have done something horrible, you made a profit. Then something else that byron york told us before our interview, he said keep in mind, capital gains goes up an additional 3.8% to pay dividends to pay for obamacare. So now if you have -- if you're an investor and say should I put my money in this, when I get dividends back, I have to factor in a profit margin, minus 23.8%. Don't tell me those smart men and women on wall street aren't going to react to that in how they invest. 
>> Steve: Keep in mind, today, january 1, 2013, $1 trillion worth of new obamacare taxes go into effect. 

[02:03:54]


>> Brian: Why didn't that happen before the election? I have no idea. 
>> Steve: You know, we're supposed to not use the expression kick the can. They were kicking the can down the road past the election and now here we are. So there were nine u.S. Senators who voted against this thing. Who are they? We're going to put up a graphic. Bipartisan in the opposition, as you can see, harkin, carper, lee, paul, shelby, bennett, grassley, and marco rubio voted against it. Rubio said look, I just ran -- i was elected here to the senate to do something about big problems. This is not doing anything to address america's real financial crisis. 
>> Brian: Shelby ripped it big time. Rand paul was never close to signing off on it. The other thing, in the opposition, in terms of the democrats, the biggest surprise, bennett. He's part of leadership. He was in a tough election fight and now says, I can't go along with this. I don't really believe we should be raising taxes. 
>> Juliet: Once this went down, you saw -- we saw images of vice president biden who was very happy, who was walking through the reporters, yeah, mitch McCONNELL N'T QUITE HAVE The same energy about this. This is what he had to say. There is the vice president after the deal has been cut walking out smiling, very happy about it, you know. Thumbs up. HERE IS mitch McConnell's reaction. 
>> Shouldn't have taken us this long to come to an agreement and this shouldn't be the model for how we do things afternoon here i. Know I can speak for my entire conference when I say we don't think taxes should be going up on anyone. But we all knew that if we did nothing, they'd be going up on everyone today. Each of us could spend the rest of the week discussing what a perfect solution would have looked like, but the end result would have been the largest tax increase in american history. So it took an imperfect solution to prevent our constituents from a very real financial pain. 
>> Steve: For a lot of republicans, it's going to be real pain in the house because keep in mind last week they voted down the republicans did, the so-called plan b, which boehner had the cap on tax increases at $1 million. Now they're going to vote on it 450, which is less than half that. The thing so many republicans said we have to address the amount of money we spend in this country. When you look at the ratio between the tax hikes and the spending cuts, it's jaw dropping. 620 billion in new tax hikes, but they're only cutting 15 billion. If you want the ratio, that's 41 to one. For every one dollar in spending cuts, they increase taxes $41. That's a big number. 

[02:06:41]


>> Brian: The president did not get the original money that he wanted with stimulus 50 billion a year. He didn't get that. He wanted 250. He wanted the threshold at 250. If you made more than that, your taxes would go up. He didn't get that. So he also didn't get control of the debt ceiling, which he initially wanted, which got a loft republicans literally laughing out loud when he requested that. This fight is only postponed for another two months and they found $24 billion to allow sequester, to be sequestered for two months. So we'll see this fight come up again in february. 
>> Juliet: This spending issue is being addressed, at least it is by republicans. LISTEN TO mitch McConnell. 
>> Now it's time to get serious about reducing washington's out of control spending. That's the debate the american people want, it's the debate we'll have next and it's a debate republicans are ready for. 
>> Steve: You got to figure there are a number of members of the house of representatives on the republican side who this morning are waking up saying, hey, why didn't we pass plan b again last week? 'Cause plan b was better for our side than the president's. 
>> Brian: The thing is that plan b wouldn't have had a prayer in the senate, but it would have been a negotiating point had they gone back. I'm curious to see if we'll be hit sitting here friday saying the house rejects this, or comes back with these suggestions how to make it better, than in comes mitch McConnell and harry reid again. 
>> Steve: Had the house passed plan b, it's always easier to negotiate down from a million rather than negotiate up from 250, which is what mitch McCONNELL HAD TO DO. But he was able to get it up to 450,000. If you are just waking up and need detail, we'll be talk being it all morning on this special education of fox friends friends. 
>> Juliet: And if you want to see what's happening around a the world, we will show you. Countries all across the world rang in the new year today. Vatican city hold ago special mass to celebrate. ?????? Pope benedict xvi leading a mass with prayer and singing. The ceremony kicked off at 3:30 this morning eastern time at saint peter's basilica in vatican city. And a million people packed times square in new york city to ring in the new year. There he is with the rockettes. There are those kissing bandits. Estimated 2,000 pounds of confetti flew through the air. 

[02:09:19]


>> Steve: That's all? That's it? 
>> Juliet: I know. The waterford crystal ball dropped. In houston, hello, let's talk about houston. Rain there. But it didn't stop thousands of people from heading downtown for performances and fireworks to celebrate the new year. In baltimore, beautiful inner harbor area, fireworks lit up the harbor to welcome 2013. 
>>> Well, hugh hefner's face lit up as he maied the woman of his dreams. The 26-year-old crystal harris. They tied the knot at the playboy mansion when the clock struck midnight. That comes a year and a half after the couple kind of like had a big breakup. They were supposed to get married. She dumped him right before the wedding. 
>> Brian: I remember it like it was yesterday. 
>> Juliet: Yeah. I don't know what the story was, but they got back together. Congratulations to hef and his lovely bride. 
>> Steve: I'm sure he's waking up in pajamas today. He always wears them. 
>> Brian: Probably got married in them. 
>> Steve: He has I think several times. Meanwhile, straight ahead. 
>> Brian: We love flannel. 
>> Steve: Thank you for joining us on this tuesday. If your child witnessed the sandy hook shooting and survived, should you be able to sue the state of connecticut for emotional trauma? We'll report on this story with the attorney general of connecticut coming up next. 
>> Juliet: Then completely separate tax hike that goes into effect today. It's separate from the fiscal cliff, another trillion dollars, obamacare, what it means for you, why you are health, your wallet, all that coming up ] coughequence?????? #8. baby.

[02:13:05]


>> Steve: Welcome back. New haven, connecticut lawyer is asking to sue the state of connecticut for $100 million on behalf of a six-year-old survivor of the newtown school massacre. Watch this. 
>> The whole thing came in over the intercom down to the screaming and the cursing and the bang, bang, bang, and her friends are dead and that's trauma. I'm saying for a fact that the state didn't do enough to provide for their safety. The state of connecticut and other states, too, are failing to protect the children from guns. 
>> Juliet: Joining us with his statement is connecticut's attorney general, george, thank you for joining us. First of all, our notes say that he was supposed to come on, but he has said he can't because he says, quote, new evidence has come in. I am postponing interviews until I can investigate the credibility of it. Your reaction when you first heard he wanted to do this? 
>> There is nothing that can diminish the enormity of the tragedy in newtown and the wounds are still very fresh and the scars are not going to heal for many, but the simple truth is that the facts don't support a lawsuit and there is no legal theory that he can come up with that would sustain a lawsuit. So we will vigorously defend the state and its taxpayers. 
>> Steve: Okay. So george, explain this to us, if you try to sue the state, you've got to first ask the office of claims commissioner whether or not it would be appropriate to do so? 
>> Under sovereign immunity, the state has to grant permission to sue. That can be by sta, for example, if somebody driving a state car hits you, you can sue. But on general torts and legal theories, you have to get permission and you have to make a case to the claims commissioner that you have a reasonable lawsuit that the state was really the cause of the harm. 
>> Steve: So then will the claims commissioner decide whether or not this is appropriate? 
>> The claims commissioner will say -- there is a strong case the state was liable or not a strong case. We believe there is not a case at all. 

[02:15:11]


>> Juliet: Pple watching are saying, well, it's the state deciding whether or not the state should be sued. Correct? 
>> We grant permission all the time when there is a reasonable case. Every time there is a trauma such as this? The facts don't sustain his case, the facts are really clear that the state really had no role whatsoever in preventing this terrible tragedy. 
>> Juliet: Here is what the law said. He says the claimant is jill doe. She heard screaming, gun fire and violence over the intercom system. Conversely, we've heard this since the day of the shooting, that authorities say that the intercom, had it not been turned on, people might not have known what was going on. More people could have been killed. 
>> I think that's a fair point. The simple bottom line is that the state is not responsible for local school safety. It's a local issue and that doesn't mean newtown is liable. Newtown did everything in our judgment, that it could have. But the bottom line is that if you open the gates to liability in a case such as this, where would it stop? 
>> Steve: That's such a good point. We did hear mr. Pinsky say that one of the reasons he was suing for $100 million was because the school did not do enough to protect the students. But as we know now -- 
>> he shot his way in. 
>> Steve: How do you stop that? They had the buzzer. It sounds like some of the personnel, the principal tried to stop him with her body. It sounds like they did -- 
>> they ran to the shooter. They did everything they could. Again, the facts don't support this and there is no legal theory that he can spin that supports a lawsuit. We're going to defend connecticut's taxpayers. 
>> Juliet: Connecticut attorney general, thank you for joining us today. We appreciate it. 
>> Thank you. 
>> Steve: Tough case. 
>> Juliet: Yeah. Washington worked hard into the night as we've been talking about all night long. And morning. But why did it have to come down to the wire? Did the american people get a raw deal because it was pushed to the last minute? 

[02:17:23]


>> Steve: Plus, you said good-bye to 2012 and now you could be saying good-bye to popular and overused phrases. 
>> Juliet: I think fiscal cliff is one. 
>> Steve: That's one. Bucket list. What else? It's coming up. ?????? ?????? Music ?????? Kids will spend 22 minutes watching us, the Super Duper Party Troopers, sing about ants in their pants. Brushing for two minutes now, can save your child from severe tooth pain later. Two minutes twice a day. They have the time. 

[02:21:08]


>> Brian: Despite the last minute deal passed by just the senate just a few hours ago, the u.S. Has technically fallen off the fiscal cliff. The house hasn't voted yet. The president hasn't signed it. So why couldn't washington solve this earlier? I'm joined by democratic strategist debbie dangle and spokesperson more the american majority action fund, ron myer. Ron, do you believe it is just atypical to this eraof congressional leads that we need the bringsmanship? 
>> Frankly, I think it's typical of this era that we have to wait 'til the last minute to pass everything and that's not a way to run things. This was planned all along to wait 'til the last minute so people would be grateful that something passed. It's totally unbalanced. 41 to one tax hike to spending cut ratio. It's crazy to say that the president all along has been advocating for a balanced approach and this is where we ended up. Really we've been holding out, running the clock so that we could pass something that the democrats love a tax hike with no spending cuts. 
>> Brian: We know this, the cbo says right now people -- in their own savings and own investing, debbie, we know it will provide less than a trillion dollars over the next ten years and we're a trillion off kilter each and every year leading up to that. So he's technically, ron is 100% right. 
>> What you're missing today is simply preventing the going over the fiscal cliff in the sense that millions of americans aren't gog have their taxes increased. Quite frankly, nobody is happy. Republicans or democrats about this bill. Everybody is kind of holing their nose and voting for it because we do have to reduce the budget in this country and it's very hard to get agreement on how we're going to do it. But the reality is 98% of americans should not see an increase in their taxes. To kick the can down the road for two months, we're going to see another drama, what I call new march madness, like we have never seen in march. Unfortunately, even to get to this point, to get the votes that we needed to postpone or make permanent, one of the things that is happening is that these bush tax cuts have been made permanent for 98% of americans. You had to get the drama so people could sell it. 

[02:23:25]


>> Brian: Let's talk about this, what's going to happen now. You think march will be big, i think tomorrow and today is going to be big when we talk about the debate in the house. Ron, bring us inside the house debate. Is this thing going to pass? What's going to be at stake? 
>> It may pass, but it won't have a majority of the republican support. In fact, I think it may have as few as 50 votes in the house and it may not even be voted on by john boehner. John boehner may vote no on this plan because he needs to save face. If he has to pass this with as few as 50, he might want to save face for his own election in two days and vote with the conservatives on this. I think that could very well happen. This plan, I was talking to members this morning, it's wildly unpopular in the gop caucus. They're upset about it. Working with joe biden, I think this shows where it gets you. We're basically tossing young people off the cliff. We're tossing this fiscal battle off the cliff and giving away all of our leverage and not doing anything to help the american people in the long run. We'll tank the economy. This was just poorly done by republicans from a negotiating standpoint. 
>> Brian: Debbie, wouldn't you have felt better if we were debating the pros and cons of simpson bowles and trying to hash thatut? Wouldn't we feel so much better about that process? 
>> Yes. Actually I would. I hope that we can get back to a simpson bowles process. I don't think anybody is trying to throw anybody off a clif one of the things that our founding fathers did was to come up with the art of compromise. Nobody is happy. So maybe that means something today. 
>> Hold on, we're definitely trying to throw the quote, unquote, wealthy off the cliff. No doubt about that. President obama said this is just the beginning of the tax hikes yesterday. They said is just a start. We'll look at it again when we're talking about negotiating for the debt ceiling. So this is just the start of wanting to throw job creators and people that give my generation jobs off the cliff, saying we're going to somehow balance the budget off the wealthy. We could tax the wealthy at 100% and still wouldn't be able to close the deficit. We wouldn't be able to cut it in half. To say we're going to prune our economy just for the sake of obama's class warfare and his ideology, I think it's sad. 
>> I'm not into strident language right now. I think republicans and democrats agree we've got to reduce the budget deficit. So I would like to see us get back to a simpson bowles. We've got to have real conversations that everythg is on the table, where all generations are having the discussion, our young people are 25% of our population, but 100% of our future. So we do care. 

[02:25:46]


>> I hope obama is with you. That's all I can say. But he's not. 
>> Brian: I was looking at what you would say a democratic friendly blog site and they said leverage lost. They were saying how the president blew it. So it just goes to show you perception is back and forth unless they're pretending as if they lost. I wonder if anything is going to be different on the debt ceiling. Is there any more leverage that the republican house has that they did not have in this debate, did you see, debbie or ron? 
>> I think they have to use the leverage of the debt ceiling saying hey, this -- this is one thing that's important to point out f. We hit the debt ceiling, it means we have to run a balanced budget. So it's not the end of the world. Yes, we have to make cuts. But guess what? It means we have to run a welled budget until w can figure out where to go from here. It's not the end of the world an republicans need to treat it like that because we have to get something done. In the next four years, if we keep punting this and kicking the can and not doing anything to address entitlements, my generation, folks my age and even people who are middle age now are going to not see these benefits anymore. They'll see increased taxes to pay the interest payments every year on the debt. 
>> Brian: Last point, debt? 
>> I would say that what we need is a lot less taking shots at each other and wed into to go into a room and have very serious conversations. Everybody has got to givement it's got to be a mixture of revenue increases -- 
>> what did you speech about that- about that speech yesterday? That was awful. He just came in and took shots. I have think you agree with that, debbie. 
>> Let's just say I hope that march madness isn't as bad as i think it may be. 
>> Brian: Right. I think we agree the interview on sunday was no walk in the park either. Thanks very much to both of you. Enjoy your debate. 
>> Happy new year. 
>> Brian: Same to you. Straight ahead, another tax hike goes into effect today. You can thank obamacare for that. And we've all heard byob. Now it's bring your own pot. That's the new thing in one state. We'll tell you about it you 

[02:30:46]


>> Steve: Take a look. Believe it or not, they've already cleaned up the cross roads of the world. 
>> Brian: It took forever. 
>> Juliet: Stop it! The city of new york sanitation department is par excellence. 
>> Brian: And they are french. 
>> Juliet: It's always fun cop not guilty in the morning when new year's eve revellers are starting to filter out of the area. 
>> Steve: They're still living it up when we drove in. I'm looking at a site in new york where you can buy all your tickets for the festivities last night. If you're still interested in partying, I understand there is an after party right now at a place called amnesia. 
>> Brian: Really? I forgot they were having a party. 
>> Steve: There is one at avenue 
>> Juliet: That's downtown. 
>> Brian: When are we going to get the invite to p diddy's? Remember we were promised that. 
>> Steve: You've been lobbying for that. 
>> Juliet: When were you promised? 
>> Brian: By him. He said we would be conveniented to all the parties. He famously throw has party in the hamptons. 
>> Brian: He invited us. I had no idea he was not going to live up to the invitation. 
>> Steve: Maybe in the coming year. 
>> Brian: Yeah. 
>> Juliet: He's diddy, not p anymore. 
>> Brian: It's p? 
>> Juliet: Isn't it? Let's look that up while I do my headlines. Even though the senateas passed the fiscal cliff deal, the bad news is taxes are going up regardless thanks to obamacare. Five new taxes under obamacare will start going into effect. They affect everything from health care costs to the cost of medical devices, as we talked about earlier with a gentleman. The congressional budget office says this is a $1 trillion tax hike over the next decade. 
>>> Secretary of state hillary clinton spending another night in the hospital. She's battling a blood clot. Doctors now revealing the clot is between her skull and her brain. Right behind her ear. Her right ear. Didn't cause a stroke or brain damage. It was discovered during a follow-up exam for a concussion she suffered from a fall in december. Doctors are treating her with blood thinners and say she's making excellent progress and expected to make a full recovery. 

[02:32:59]


>>> And byop? Colorado has opened its first recreational pot club. It's been just a month since pot was legalized in that state and as soon as this private club was created, 200 lucky folks quickly signed up. They ran over there with their munchies. Colorado's pot law prohibits public smoking. It doesn't include clubs. No pot is sold inside. You have to bring your own. 2012 is out and with it goes some of the most overused and played out phrases. Anybody have any suggestions as to what should be thrown out? 
>> Steve: Fiscal cliff. 
>> Juliet: Okay. You're right. It's thrown out. Lake superior state university, they said these are the worst that should be banned from the english language. Fiscal cliff, spoiler alert,. 
>> Steve: I like that one. 
>> Juliet: Bucket list. Trending. And brian and I had no idea what this is, yolo. 
>> Steve: You only live once, baby. 
>> Juliet: Or you lob. 
>> Steve: Time for sports. 
>> Brian: It was a bad day for the country yesterday becaus you talk about a fiscal cliff and the markets reacting and it was bad to be an nfl coach that didn't make the playoffs. Every time you turn around, someone is getting fired. Seven coaches fired, five gm's fired. Just in one day in 2012. The last day of 2012. Among the casualties, chargers coach turner, eagles coach, expected months ago. Bears coach, smith. The bills, browns and cardinals said good-bye to theirs. This is the fun part. Fox sports.Com learned the bears and eagles are looking at offensive coordinator of the broncos who helped peyton manning transform his career, as well as tim tebow for a while. mike McCoy. Reid is set to be putting together a staff and chiefs and eagles and browns are interested in dirk cutter. With the nhl season skating on thin ice, there seems to be some positive movement. They're talking! The players association submitted a counter proposal that happened yesterday. The two sides meet today. In order to get a season, a deal would be reached by next friday or forget it. All of a sudden this sense of urgency, but before this week, the sides hadn't met since december 13. Normally it's that special day when they play outdoors, not this year. We are rolling now right along with the middle of the college bowl season. In the back stretch. We have a few great games on tap for you to take in if you're not watching news. Clemson won yesterday over lsu in the chick-fil-a bowl. They kicked this game winning 37-yard field goal as time expired. A comeback in their win. Today's games, outback bowl. South carolina takes on michigan. Georgia and nebraska will square off in the citrus bowl. And stanford meets wisconsin in the rose bowl. That should be fun. And that's it for the fun and games. Now let's talk dollars and cents. 

[02:36:05]


>> Juliet: Yeah. Fiscal cliff deal is on the table. But the hours still has to vote on it. How could this proposal affect the economy? What happens if the house injects it? 
>> Steve: Talk to that guy now, "fox business" network's charl payne. Charles, it is past the senate. Chances are it's probably going to pass the house. What's it mean for everybody watching? 
>> I got to tell you, I guess we always kind of knew there would be some sort of ultimate compromise, at least everyone sort of felt that way. It's not good news for the economy. It's certainly not good news for small businesses who still are being really going to be hammered. You have been talking about obamacare taxes, they'll be hammered by that. They'll be hammered by this dramatically. Let's just say, for instance, you're a chiropractor and off gross margin of 15%. All of a sudden your taxes go up, your business taxes go up. Are you going to cut your salary or hesitate on hiring someone? I mean, this is where all the -- a lot of jobs have been created by small businesses. You'd be shocked how many businesses with less than 20 employees, they've been just these little engines beneath the surface chugging along, keeping us above the surface. And that gets hit pretty good. 
>> Steve: With the senate proposal, it goes from about 35 to almost 40%. With your hypothetical 15%, that chops 5% off right there. 
>> Absolutely does. Of course, you pointed out how heavily weighted weighted this is towards spending. Listen, the market was up big yesterday. The stock market was up big yesterday, in part out of just a sense of relief. Also in part, out of a sense of it could have been worse. But this does not help. It's not a pro-economic bill. 
>> Brian: As you point out, they were talking about dividend taxes going up to 40% instead of going up to 20%, adding obamacare 23%. They also talk about that it could have got a lot worse in terms of the threshold on income. Could have been 250. It's 400. 
>> Right. Those are concessions. I think relatively small concessions with respect, again, to small businesses. What I found shocking was the payroll tax cut. The reason I found this shocking is not that I'm a proponent of it, but when the president promised taxes wouldn't go up on regular folks, guess what, regular folks, it's going to go up and you're going to see it immediately. I was surprised by that. But they kept the unemployment extension and that's another $30 billion. A whole lot of earned credits, child credits. Whole lot of things that were originally in the stimulus package continued. So I guess that was the choice. People who go to work every day are going to get hit pretty good to support people who don't go to work every day. Obviously we're compassionate nation, but again, getting back to the notion from an economic point of view, at some point we need a pro-growth policy, pro-growth agenda to really get us out of this mess instead of borrowing, taxing, penalizing. 

[02:39:04]


>> Brian: No budget! We don't even have a budget for three years. Now none for a fourth year because we're so busy negotiating all this stuff. 
>> Speaking of which, you can't wait for the debt ceiling, which is the next big giant hurdle to go through. 
>> Steve: You know when is celebrating? People who work up on capitol hill, the president by executive order upped the pay for congressmen, goes up about 900 bucks for the average rank and file member. Joe biden gets a pay raise. He's up to 231,000. Portman in the senate has drafted legislation to rescind it. Michelle bachmann in the house 
said this: I'm calling on my colleagues in the house and senate to rescind president obama's executive order that gives members of congress a pay raise. This executive order was not requested by congress and we should reject it. We have a spending problem in our country and we should be looking for areas to cut. 
>> Absolutely, guys. This is an embarrassment. It really, really is. 
>> Steve: But they're very effective on capitol hill, what are you talking about? 
>> Brian: They're supposed to get a cost of living increase, but they forego that for the last couple years. 
>> Keep foregoing it. If you campaign on shared sacrifice, if you keep talking about the billionaires billionaires and millionaires, when you're really talk being small businesses, moderately successful americans who have done everything right, including a tremendous amount of sacrifice, it's an embarrassment that you would give yourself and your colleagues this kind of a raise. Remember, 100 million people are going to go to work this week and when they get their next check, their payroll tax will come back. Remember the white house, if you go on their web site, but remember all the videos that show how important that extra 40 bucks was, how it changed people's lives? So that's gone, but you give vice president biden a raise? Are you kidding me? 
>> Brian: I remember the family couldn't get pizza. Now they can't get pizza again. 
>> Yeah, well. I just think -- none of this is economic, guys. Realistically n a real -- 

[02:41:10]


>> Steve: It's all politics. 
>> It's politics. It's division, it's divisiveness. It does nothing to help our country. 
>> Brian: Simpson bowles debate would have been worth it. Tell them what's good and bad about that, getting your hands dirty and trying to rebalance the budget. 
>> I think the big problem for the politicians is when they do the right thing, it's like planting a seed and ultimately when it does spring that fruit, they'll be gone. They won't be able to take credit for it or the victory laps that we have to live through all the time after these kind of little bogus deals are cobbled together last year. Go through this drama two or three months down the road. It's all self-serving and all ridiculous. 
>> Juliet: That's why polls show americans have a horrible opinion of the way congress is. 
>> They really should have a horrible opinion of the way congress acts. The real fiscal cliff beneath our feet is the $16 trillion in debt that's going to continue to go higher and higher and the lost opportunities. This country is nowhere near living up to its greatness that we possess. Nowhere near it. 
>> Steve: Let's see. We're just starting a new year. We can be optimistic burks -- but relickicly?

>> Steve: We got quick headlines for you on this new year morning. Sea sick, over 200 people have gotten sick on this cruise ship in the caribbean. Federal health officials say the virus causes stomach and digestive problems to passengers on the queen mary 2. Last week 200 people also got sick on it, on a separate ship. 
>>> Talk about last call forever, a new law in australia is banning ladies night. It's part of an effort to tackle binge drinking. Some in the bars found loophole that said if the deal applies to everyone, it's okay. So they might be offering a free drinks to men on ladies night. Mr. Kilmeade, juliet. 
>> Juliet: No, no, doesn't work that way. Talk about that later. 
>> Brian: Perfect segueway. Chances are you made a new year's resolution. Already people have said doing it to -- have been doing since the days of julius caesar. Many turn to faith to help them keep their promises and reach their goals. 
>> Juliet: Father jonathan morris joins us live. Have you made any new year's resolutions. 
>> Chances are people have not made them. Most people who are watching us either probably are not in a state of understanding us, 'cause they haven't gone to bed yet, or they're so good anyway, that they probably don't need to make a new year's resolution. But my suggestion is two fold. One is that we look for deeper motivation to keep new year's resolutions. We can all say, I want to lose ten pounds. I want to try to be nicer to somebody. What are the deep motivations that can help us really be faithful to our new year's resolutions? I have two scripture passages i would like to show to all of you this morning. The first one, they're going to put on full screen. If not, since I have the -- 
>> Juliet: There we go. 
>> Here is one, for you are dead and your life is hid with christ in god. This scripture passage is recognizing we have sinned. Okay? That we have sinned, but that there is new hope. The scripture says you are dead, it means we have sinned and we messed up, but we can start again and that our life has hidden christ, meaning we are connd to jesus, who is offering a us a new possibility. That's one. That there is hope for us. The second one, here is this 

[02:47:49]


from peter 1, verses 4: To an inherent incorruptible and undefile in that faith does -- that does not fade away reserved in heaven for you. That's king james version, it's very hard to pronounce. But th point here is that there is hope in heaven! You can go to the scripture and you can find motivation to keep going. Here is the second motivation that I suggest to awful you. This is more less scripture, a little more rational, I would say. 
Is this: Ask some people you trust. Ask some people you trust. I did thisith five people. Ask people you trust to give you two suggestions, put them in an envelope, type them up, of things you -- that you should be working on. 
>> Juliet: It's scary. 
>> It's tough, right? Because it's very easy for us to say, I know I need to do this because I want to change this anyway. But what about the things that you need to be working on that we are not able to grasp ourselves? I put that suggestion on my facebook and twitter and I meant saying I'm doing this with family and friends that I trust. People thought I was saying i need their suggestions and so people started putting all this stuff on. 
[ Laughter ] but it was very funny. 
>> Brian: That is fascinating. My problem is that no matter who I ask, they all agree that I'm perfect. 
>> Really? 
>> Brian: And I find myself in this quandary every new year. 
>> You need to ask people who you trust to people the truth to you. I'm happy to do is it t. 
>> Let's do it together. Really to be serious, okay? 'Cause I know you like to be serious, ask people, for example, your wife or someone else to write down the things that you could work on this year. 
>> Brian: She'll be at it all day. 
>> Steve: Keep it to three. Ell her to keep it to three. I'm going to send you an envelope with my suggestions, so you don't know it's me. Things you can work on. 

[02:49:55]


>> Brian: Okay. 
>> The point here is take the new year seriously to too something you don't feel like doing, but it will make you feel better and more I couldn't night to do god and people you love. 
>> Brian: Thank you for coming in. 
>> I'll try to get the real estating of scripture down better next time. 
>> Brian: You nailed it! I blame king james. Not father jonathan. 
>> Juliet: All right. Co up, after missing the midnight deadline, the senate cut a fiscal cliff deal in the overnight hours. But we're not out of the woods yet because the republican house still has to vote. So what's going to happen with that? Texas congressman jeb hensarling is next. 
>> Brian: The government pulls the plug on a popular light bulb. The alternative will cost you more. It's called a candle. ?????? ??????

>> Steve: If you're just waking up, fox news alert. Last-mininute deal cut in the u.S. Senate last night, early this morning to avoid a major tax hike on every american. Only problem, the house is not voted on it yet and the president hasn't signed it. So technically we we want off the cliff last night at midnight. So what is the house going to do? A member of the house of representatives, jeb hensarling joins us from washington, d.C good morning to you. 

[02:54:27]


>> Good morning. 
>> Steve: All right. So the house is going to get that later today. We know you're open for business. Are you going to vote on it? 
>> Well, we are open for business, but it would be nice to at least have the opportunity to read what the senate has done. We passed our bill to prevent all tax increases on all americans back in july, so the senate had months to look at that. We passed our bill to keep the sequester savings, but to do it in a smarter fashion back in september. The senate's had months. The democratic controlled senate had months to look at that and now they're expecting us to vote on something they passed hours ago without reading it? I don't think so. But I would hope we would take a look at it. If we have to study it, understand it. This cannot be a bum's rush dealing with something that's going to impact so many people. But what republicans have tried to do is prevent tax increases on small businesses, on working families and to get to the root of our debt crisis, which is that we have a spending-driven debt crisis promoted by the president and regardless of what's in this deal t doesn't take care of the spending-driven debt crisis that unfortunately could lead us down the road to being greece one day. I'm concerned looking at the press reports of this deal in the senate is that it actually includes new spending from the president. 
>> Steve: It does. You have been on this program and you've talked about the importance of spending cuts, real meaningful spending cuts with the way we're spending our nation's treasury right now. But you look at it, they are going to raise taxes $41 for every one dollar that they cut. I know that just -- too bad we don't have one of those blood pressure things hooked up on you. I'd like to see that number. When the house does take this up eventually, I would manual there will be amendments tacked on, knowing john boehner. If you had to make changes on this, what would you like to see included? 

[02:56:31]


>> The first thing is there should be zero, zero new spending in this. Under the president, in four years he's amosed more national debt than in the previous 200. This is unsustainable. Tax revenues are about where they were five or six years ago. But spending under him has increased 20%. That's why before he became president, what used to be annual deficits are pretty much now morphing into monthly deficits under him. The most important thing is he can't get there with tax increases. You give the president every single job crushing tax increase he's requested, it's about two to 3% of his spending agenda. It's about 15 to maybe 17% of the additional five to $6 trillion of additional debt. So it's really a shell game. Ultimately says no, we're going to tax the wealthy, tax the wealthy. And by the way, 0.3% of all americans have million dollars incomes. Tax them all you want, ultimately this is going to fall on work class people. It's going to harm jobs and it does nothing to deal with our deficit. So I'm not terribly impressed by what the senate came up with. But I know my senate republican colleagues, they're operating with a gun on their head and i understand that. 
>> Steve: Absolutely. Congressman, you're probably going to take it up later on today. Thank you very much for the preview. Jeb hensarling from texas.

[03:01:18]


Juliet: Oh, yeah. 
Steve: Sing it, frank. 
Juliet: I love frank sinatra. 
Brian: One person's party is the other person's cleanup. 
Juliet: They get it done real fast. The second the ball drops they head out of there and go to the clubs. 
Brian: The fun being there. The thing that is deceptive. They put you behind the bike racks. You can not drink anything. Can not use the bathroom and get your spot back. You're locked in like cattle until afternoon. 
Juliet: The key the hotels around there sold out for next year. But that is the key. Get a nice little room. Have a little party with your friends. 
Steve: Very nice. You see it all. If you missed the ball dropping stuff like that. We have details. This is our fox news alert. This is the reason brian and I are in with juliet today. The people in that building were burning midnight oil. They could have a fiscal hangover. What they have done, technically we have sailed over the fiscal cliff. The senate last night, a vote 89-89, passed a bill which will jack up taxes on america's most successful. Now what it is doing making its way across the hall into the house. Will they take it up later today? Maybe. They're under no obligation. But there is a real good possibility, john boehner and company, republicans who voted down plan b will say, no, don't like it the way it is. 
Brian: What is in it? What do we know? Taxes won't go up for those making 250,000. Won't go up over single person making 400. For a coupleaking 450,000. Dividend and capital-gains taxes go from 15% to 20 obamacare,.8%. If you know someone who died they have to give up 40% what they inherited over $5 million as opposed to 35%. They were saying that was going to be higher than that unemployment insurance, instead of six months, remain as year. 

[03:03:31]


Juliet: Here is basically how it went down. It was 89 8 vote. Here is group voted against it. Tom harkin, democrat iowa. Tom carper. Rand paul from kentucky. Republican as well. Richard shelby, republican, alabama. Michael bennet from colorado, he is a democrat. Charles grassley from ohio. Marco rubio from florida. 
Steve: Why did the republicans vote against it? Republicans don't like to increase taxes on anybody. Republicans say this does nothing on spending. Why did ultraliberal democrats vote against it? They didn't like the fact that they moved the thred from 250 up to 450 for couples in the stop tax bracket. 
Brian: There's a lot of people who believe that when you have a strong vote from the senate like that, it puts unbelievable amount of pressure on the house. Maybe in past generations, in past decades and past, past bicameral negotiations that would be but it seems as though republicans in the house will do what they think is right. They have already shown that when people were asked, when they asked them to have the plan ready, to say let's raise taxes on those who make over a million dollars. I'm not sure they feel the pressure like everyone says they do. 
Steve: Apparently we got a tick-tock from ed henry. He described what happened. Apparently behind the scenes, okay, they eventually settled on $450,000. APPARENTLY when McConnell started dealing directly WITH BIDEN, McCONNELL'S First offer was 750. Remember boehner's last week was a million. Over last couple, I want to say early sunday morning. mitch McConnell offer was 750,000. That got the president and biden to amp it where it is now. 
Juliet: Jumping over harry reid. 
Steve: Harry reid was not returning phone calls. mitch McConnell said I will eliminate the middleman. Here is the senate minority leader why I' friday to do something he does not like which is raise taxes? 

[03:05:36]


>> I know I can speak for my entire conference we say w don't think taxes should be going up on anyone. We all knew if we did nothing, they would be going up on everyone today. Each of us could spend the rest of the week discussing what a perfect solution would have looked like but the end result would have been the largest tax increase in american history. So it took an imperfect solution to prevent our constituents from a very real financial pain. 
Juliet: Remember, a deal only cuts 15 billion in spending. 15 billion. 
Steve: Raises over 600 billion in taxes. This morning we've been talking about it extensively. That is everyone dollar cut, they jack up taxes $41. If you're against raising taxes, that's, you would think that's a deal breaker. 
Brian: Steve, earlier we talked to john tamney from realclearmarkets.Com. He was e-mailing us at 3:00 in the morning look at the bill, he was really upset republicans would sign off on it. He thinks it is bad for the country. Here's more. 
>> They should run from this as fast as they possibly can. This is such a bad deal for republicans. One of the best things about their brand they are principled against tax increases. They realize we have a spending problem, not a revenue problem. To turn around and agree to major tax increases, that's what we're talking about, in return for nothing in the way of spending cuts would be the ultimate in bad deals. 
Steve: He says the house should run away from it. Charles krauthamer was on the channel last night. Given the president of the united states's, he had that cheerleader rally in the middle of the day, when it looked for a while like the president might have actually derailed the deal, krauthamer had this to say about the tenor of the president. 
>> I found it astonishing. Here he is coming out to speak to the nation at a crucial moment in very delicate negotiations and he comes out there with incredible arrogance. He really kills the congress. He spikes the football on the republicans. He rubs in the fact that they were resisting a raise in rates. He made them do it. And of course as always he places himself hovering benignly at an olympian level above the fray where the children are playing in the sandbox and he asking that everybody be reasonable as if he just arriving in washington on a tourist visa. 

[03:08:12]


Juliet: Ouch. Oh, man. 
Brian: It is true. I just don't get the interview sunday on "meet the press." I don't understand the meaning of press conference I guess to address his union supporters and those on the left he is the guy fighting still for why he claims he was elected but the tenor was just, it was a mocking that would have made muhammad ali, when he was cassius clay blush. 
Steve: I think what has been revealed over past couple days, the president of the united states while he was running for re-election, we have to do stuff to make sure entitlements and big spending progr we rein them in a little bit. He shows no sign of actually wanting to cut anything. In fact what he made clear yesterday in that same press availability, was he said that in addition to whatever tax hikes happen with this latest senate deal, he wants to jack up taxes even more in the coming year. 
Brian: The good news, defense is not going to be cut for at least two months. They found a way to get $24 billion that would postpone any sequester for at least a couple of months. There were people, for lack of a better term, in the line of fire, that was the place that was going to be the most gutted and for whatever reason they were the ones that would take the bulk of the cuts to go through today, if there was no McConvell deal. 
Juliet: Two months goes by real fast. Let's talk about happy things, shall we, boys? 
Brian: Like for example? 
Juliet: Seems real heavy in here. 
Steve: Where did this confetti come from? 
Juliet: Problem of bottom of somebody's foot when they came in here today. 
Brian: Hemmer's sweater. 
Juliet: A million people packed in times square in new york city to ring in the new year. Check this out. So they say it was like 2000 pound of confetti as we watched the rockettes kiss mayor bloomberg and this couple make out. The waterford crystal ball dropped at midnight of course. In houston, texas rain did not stop thousands of people to head downtown and watch performances and to celebrate. The beautiful harbor area, fireworks lit it up to welcome in 2013. Scary moments though. A terrifying scene. A helicopter trying to rescue a stranded swimmer. This happened in rio. They had beautiful fireworks there. This is fireworks you didn't want to see. A helicopter crashing into the ocean. Amazing all four people inside managed to make it out okay. The swimmer was outside. He was in distress. That is why the helicopter was going down to rescue the swimmer. Fortunately he was saved by a nearby surfer.

>>> Year long pain at the pump for americans that reached an all-time high. Aaa says the national average for a gallon of gas in 2012, way back when, was nine cents higher than t record of 3.60 in 2011. Bad weather and tension in the middle east dro up prices.

>> Pig tails, cfl? 
Brian: Give me a bull be please. 
Steve: This is why I turn on a light, see stuff. A 40 watt bulb? Come on. What is this about a thousand watts? 
Brian: Your home has no backlighting. That is one thing I always said. 
Steve: I have a key light. But that is something else. 
Juliet: Don't want to hear about that. 
Steve: This tuesday, first day of 2013, an american family dreams torn apart by international politics as vladmir putin, president of russia, bans all adoptions in act of retaliation against the united states. One couple's heartbreaking story coming up. 
Juliet: Yeah. President obama says congress should get raises. Most americans think they're doing a lousy jobs. Will lawmakers see more money that their paycheck this is year? We've talk about that@ ?????? sing polly wolly doodle all the day ???????????? ?????? hah @???????????? @@@ 

[03:14:42]


juliet: Welcome back. 14 minutes past the hour. Russia's president vladmir putin banned the adoption of russian children by americans, haltin the adoptions already in progress, dealing an emotional blow understandably to many families. Craig and kim church went with their two daughters all the way to russia, spending hours getting to know the what little boys who were supposed to become part of their family. Now those dreams have been put on hold. Craig and kim join us now from charlotte. Good to see you guys again. 
>> Good morning. 
>> Good morning. 
Juliet: Thank you very much. So, guys, tell me exactly what happened here? Where were you in the process of getting your children a? 
>> Well on october the 24th we received our referral. On november 16th we were on a plane to go visit our boys. We were with them are over thanksgiving. Stayed with them a week. Returned home and in the process of waiting on a court date in russia to go back and adopt them. 
Juliet: Craig, what happened? 
>> Well, we got home. Then we heard of the potential ban. We got a little heads up from that on our adoption agency. Then we just started praying. And just asking, no, no explanation why. We just found out and then, just started praying and asking the lord to intervene in this. I know many people are devastated. Our hearts are breaking humanly speaking but spiritually speaking we're staying strong in our faith and our lord jesus christ. 
Juliet: What are your plans at this point? Because we had somebody on the show yesterday who decided she would go there early as possible and just made it in the 11th hour. What are you doing at this point? Are you trying to get back over there? Are you talking to the agency? What are they saying? 
>> Right now the agency is speaking with us. They're kind of waiting on confiration as well. They don't want to give us information they're not sure is exact. So we're just waiting on them. As craig said, we're waiting on the lord, that is where our trust is right now. He can do the impossible. We don't know exactly what we'll do. We're just waiting, to find out exactly what the law means, especially the 46 children in the pipeline, ready to come home and seen their parents already. Two of those of course are our. 

[03:17:03]


Juliet: Americans need to understand. These children have been passed over by russians themselves. 
>> Yes. 
Juliet: Tell us a little bit about who these children are. 
>> Well, our boys are precious. All children are. A reward from the lord, psalm 127. There are 26 children that have been saved. There are 2,000 thousand orphans in russia so this is a small number. 27,000. They are waiting for us to return. We have seen them. We have held them. We loved them. We told them in our broken russian we are coming back. So they are expecting us to return. 
>> And our oldest one is thad, he is 3 1/2. Our youngest one is 1 1/2. We believe they're our children. God's called us to do this. We believe that they'reurs and we're just asking everybody right now to just to pray, pray with us. A simple prayer. Lord, bring these boys home. And also pray for those, 46 others and families that are devastated and their hearts are breaking like ours. 
Juliet: I literally have a lump in my throat. I've been talking to folks like you over last few days and it is heartbreaking. The especially, kim, what you said about the children the they're waiting for you to come back and get them. This is unbelievably sickening that vladmir putin said. There are probably many places in the world living standards are better than ours. So what? Shall we send all children there or move there ourselves? What kind of human being is he. Thanks very much for joining us. We'll watch your situation. Stay in touch with us and let us know. Best to you. 
>> God bless. 
>> Same to you. Thank you. 
Juliet: Coming up, are republicans ly to agree to the fiscal cliff deal? The senate has just put on the table? We'll talk to our senior capitol hill editor chad pergram up next.

Juliet: Well-come back. 22 minutes past the hour. Some quick headlines. Everybody get ready to pay more in taxes. Five new taxes go into effect under obamacare. They affect everything from health care cost to the cost of medical devices. The congressional budget office says this is a one trillion dollars tax hike over the next decade. 
>>> People in massachusetts saying good-bye to 2012 and bottled water. New ban on selling single-serving last plastic water bottles. That is effort to cut back on waste. Stores caught selling the bottles face a $50 fine. Steve and brian? 
Steve: Thanks, huddy. The senate may have approved a scaled down bill but we're not out of woods yet. It needs toe passed by the house of representatives. We're talking about the fiscal cliff and they came up with tax hikes. 
Brian: If we do pass it are we still out of the woods anyway? We're joined by fox news senior capitol hill editor chad pergram. He told us he doesn't need to sleep. 
Steve: He is giving us play-by-play wherever across the globe. 
Brian: Chad, in your mind when did this appear to be to be passed in the senate? 
>> It was not until the very end hour, I'll tell you last night. It was key to hear that joe biden, vice president was coming to the c. We were told there was still selling to do. We sort of described joe biden up here jokingly, he was the closer. That was always the signal we new ones you heard joe biden is coming to the capitol and would be like rivera coming from the bullpen and they're playing the sandman. That is the key thing last night. We're told house republicans were not a part of this. Brendan buck, a spokesman for house speaker john boehner, said this was all THE VICE PRESIDENT AND mitch McConnell the minority leader in the senate. This was going on between both of them. That's why there is a lot of question as they try to move this through the house of representatives in the next day or two. 

[03:24:28]


Steve: Let's talk about that. So the house is open for business today. There is no assurance they will take this up. John boehner, he had a much different blueprint than this thing he got from mitch McCONNELL. You have to figure. We just had jeb hensarling, the congressman from texas. He said, if it was up to him and time to do some amending to the senate bill you have to do something about spending because that does not seem to be addressed in any form in this bill. 
>> Jeb hensarling is one of the rock-ribbed conservatives and looks at spending and the broader picture down the road. This bill does not address the grand bargain issues like entitlements that are the main drivers of the debt and those frankly are conservatives and some democrats to try to tackle. It is hard to get your brain wrapped around the numbers and get to something. Nobody wants to give and getting to the votes is very, very hard. I should point out jeb hensarling at least fo the moment is the chair of house republican conference that will change come thursday when the new conference starts. He did not sign onto the statement put out by the house rub rub leadership. KEITH think McMorris rogers, number number four leader in the house she signed on by not jeb hensarling. That is where ends zarlink is right now. 
Brian: Back to the senate for a second. I saw you put out senator nett, came out with a statement, democrat from colorado. I didn't vote for this. Just to summarize he said because I was for a bill that would cut the deficit. This doesn't cut the deficit. Is there a sense among republicans they have to hold their nose to sign this or more democrats had to hold their nose to sign this? 
>> I think they both have to hold their noses. This bill is so big whether it deals with all the difficult provisions of taxes and estate tax, keeping dairy prices from going up. There is partial renewal of the farm bill for nine months. There is enough in this bill a member, if he or she wanted to vote for the bill they could go through, like a cafeteria option pluck off here are two or three things. My voters back in my district this is a tough bill. I don't like everything in it but these two or three things are important for our constituents and they can justify how they vote. I tell you just a minute ago to dave camp who is the chairman of ways and means mmittee. He said this is a very big vote. This is something that members will have to take some time to think about. That's why it is very questionable whether or not they can move that through the house of representatives now. 

[03:26:59]


Steve: Chad, before you go, I know you're talking to a number of members. What is their reaction to the president with that tv appearance he had yesterday afternoon where essentially, it seemed like a pep rally and a campaign stop? He said, he put the republicans on alert, he wasn't going to let them shove spending cuts at us. I SAW john McCain was upset by the combments and so were senator corker as well. 
>> Many, many republicans especially house republicans thought that was a little bit of gloating by the president. From the president's perspective they might argue, hey, we won the election, give us some elbow room here. We're actually asserting positions people voted for us to fulfill in the new term. That was a little bit wat was going on. That absolutely rubbed a lot of republicans wrong. Had we not been in such a critical circumstance here, that might dwindle the amount of votes people that might vote for this at the end of theay. 
Brian: Rather than get an e-mail next few minutes, let me ask you directly. Do you think there will be a vote today, tomorrow or what is more likely, or the next day in the house? 
>> It is very hard. I talked a couple other people. They said they prepared potential amendment plans for what they thought was coming from the senate. At the end of the day it is not exactly what they looked like. They might have to go back and recalculate this. Another viewpoint might be, let's take whatthe bill was and see whe the chips fall. Let's just vote on the bill to see where it goes. Thats something that the house republicans will have to hash out. House democrats will have to hash this out too to see where they stand on this everybody so far is being very tentative about this, because, hey, we're already off the cliff at least from acutarial standpoint. In some respects it is hurry up and wait. Other people would like to move quick lift other people would like to say, hey, calm this down a little bit. There is no reason we have to vote on the senate bill right away. 
Steve: Chad pergram our head guy on capitol hill. Take the microphone off and talk to everybody in the building. 
>> I will be took that. 
Brian: Never use their names. Coming up straight ahead, did you party too hardy last night? Be honest with me, be honest with yourself. Do you have a changeover? If so, stick around we're sharing some remedies that are guaranteed to work. 

[03:29:10]


Steve: Starts with kettle one. 
Brian: That is how it starts. I will tell you how it should end. 
Steve: Fine. ] of? Bikes and balloons, wholesome noodles on spoons. A kite, a breeze, a dunk of grilled cheese. Catches and throws, and spaghettio's. That's what happy kids are made of. Campbell's. It's amazing what soup can do. 

[03:32:05]


Steve: Fox news alert. The u.S. Senate reached a fiscal cliff deal of sorts at the 11th hour in the middle of the night. How are democrats and the president feeling this morning? Relieved or anxious getting it through to the house where they may vote on later today or maybe not? 
Brian: Steve, you have great questions. Only one man capable and standing by to answer those questions. 
Steve: How lucky are we. Look it is wendell goler at the white house. 
[Cheering] 
>> Reporter: If my buddy chad pergram couldn't answer the question a few minutes ago I couldn't answer the question. We'll wait to see if the house will vote today on the senate passed basiy binds the country two month nsion of so-called fiscal cliff. The measure raises revenue. As chad points out it contains no spending cuts. That will make it hard sell to house republicans. The all but five senate republicans voted for it may make it easier to swallow. The deal makes the bush administration tax cut permanent for families making less than $450,000 a year. Provides another year of extended unemployment benefits, raises value of estates protected from the death tax but payroll taxes are going back up. Vice president biden who worked out the deal with senate republican leader mitch McConnell wouldn't bet on how the house will vote. 
>> Surely shouldn't predict how the house is going to vote though I feel very, very good. Happy new year and I will see you all maybe tomorrow. 
>> Reporter: Now before the senate vote, president obama had appeared with middle class americans who face a tax hike to pressure house republicans. After the vote he released a statement that said, in part, e, this agreement is the right thing to do for our country and the house should pass it without delay but with no commitment to cut spending, house republican leaders said they wanted to study the bill before promising a vote. EVEN senator McConnell admitted the compromise wasn't a pretty one. 

[03:34:07]


>> Shouldn't have taken us this long to come to an agreement and it shouldn't be the model how we do things around here but the appreciate the vice president's willingness to get this done for the country. I know I can speak for my entire conference I say we don't think taxes should be going up on anyone. 
>> Reporter: The house is back in session about noon. If it does pass the bill we could look for another big fight over spending within weeks when congress is faced with raising the nation's debt limit. Brian, steve, juliet? 
Steve: Wendell, thank you very much. I'm looking, jason chaffetz, of course congressman from utah, republican side, says on twitter, without substantial real, first-year cuts in spending I can't vote a bill passed by the senate last night. How many guys like him are thinking about that this morning? 
Brian: He is one of the people that didn't vote for the million dollar plan b threshold. 
Juliet: All right. Let's get out to some other headlines now. Iran continuing its military drills for a fourth day. This is new video you're looking at released by iranian television. It shows iran military test firing two missiles yesterday in the strait of hormuz. They fired one of the missiles from land that reportedly struck a mukhtar get in the water. Iranian officials say it is a show of the country's power and resolve. Six days of drills started friday will continue through tomorrow. 
>>> People are still recovering from the tragic shooting from newtown, connecticut. Now a lawyer is looking to sue the state for $100 million on behalf of a 6-year-old survivor. He said the state didn't do enough to keep kids safe. The attorney general joined us earlier on fox and friends and said this is not the case. 
>> The simple bottom lin the state is not responsible for local school safety. It's a, it's a local issue. That doesn't mean that newtown is liable. Newtown did everything in our judgement that it could have but the bottom line is, if you open the gates to liability in a case such as this, where would it stop? 

[03:36:08]


Juliet: The connecticut trial lawyer association released a statement saying the timing, circumstance of this action are ill-advised. 
>>> Minnesota congresswoman michele bachmann introducing legislation to block a planned pay raise for congress. President obama approved the raise last week. Bachmann said give the current state of the economy that doesn't seem like a smart idea. In her statement she says quote, we have a spending problem in our country. We should look for areas to cut spending of. Several other republican lawmakers are blocking the effort to block raise. Fiscal cliff deal puts kibosh on pay raises. It hasn't passed house so technically it is still on the table. 
>>> If the house passes the senate fiscal cliff bill we avoid going ov the dairy cliff. This will prevent from milk prices doubling to nearly eight bucks a gallon the senate version of the bill extends the farm bill for another year, keeping current dairy programs in place. Farmers allow people to focus on giving customers what they need. 
>> We have become more innovative. We're into the marketplace we have new products. We have lactose-free milk, low-fat, low sugar flavored milks. That is exactly what you're going to do now. What do you want a as consumer. We'll take care of you. 
Juliet: House speaker john boehner has pushed back voting a new five-year farm bill for months saying it doesn't have the support it needs to pass. 
>>> Brian, what's going on over there, buddy? 
Brian: Well, I'll trying to help a lot of american people. Are you physicianed and faded out today because of wild new year's eve. Do you feel you're hung over for the first time in your adult life? You don't know what to do? We want to be your resource. We don't have a hotline but we have a segment prepared for you. We have a mixologist. She brought remedies to cure the hangover. Yesterday he told us what? 
>> I told you how to prevent the hangover ahead of time the since you didn't listen to my advice I will help you cure the hangover. 

[03:38:11]


Brian: Great. Let's start here. 
>> There are a lot of ways to cure a hangover which is called hair of the dog. Drinking more alcohol. It doesn cure anything. It prolongs the hangover. 
Brian: But it softens it am I correct? 
>> Totally softens it. Classic one is bloody mary. We're making it with a keetel one. Always roll the bloody marys. 
Brian: Don't want to get the drink angry. 
>> No, angry drinks are the worst. If you don't like vodka, i have something called bloody maria. This is a nice millky liquor coming from mexico. I like to had suracha, tabasco, awake the senses. Incredible what it does to the palate. 
Brian: If you have a bloody mary to get the hangover, recommending to get out of the hangover have a bloody mary? 
>> Yes. A bit less alcohol. Do something like a hot toddy. We have tea with to coat the stomach. You will not feel very good in the tummy. Ron yeager liquor. It gives natural sweetness. 
Brian: A little liquor? 
>> A little liquor to take off the edge. 
Brian: Can I taste this? This is the actual mix? 
>> It is the actual mix. Your stomach will feel a lot better after it. 
Brian: Okay. 
>> Best thing to do is hydrate, hydrate, hydrate. Keep drinking water. For people who drink coffee, it is really important not to deprive yourself of that caffeine you might need in the morning. It will make your headache way worse if you don't grab that cup. 
Brian: You realize that takes the water out of your body? It dehydrates you, right. 
>> Make sure to put water in. Best thing to do is get the electrolytes back into the system. Gatorade is great but my remedy is coconut water. Less suggest far. There are great brands here. You can get at any bodega or store across the country. 

[03:40:14]


Brian: They're both the same one, right? This is the same thing? 
>> They're both all natural coconut water. Potassium, you lose a lot of essential site pins and -- vitamins and minerals. Grab a banana. Grab a banana eat one after a long night out I feel great. Also have some caches. Do not go to dairy or citrus. It will be terrible for your system. Have a lot of caches to remen shish all you lost. 
Brian: Don't want the bloody mary. Tired of hot water. Don't want the tea. Don't want tanana. Nothing wrong with a piece of bread and jamming it down your throat. 
>> That people like greasy food but grains are essential. 
Brian: Always the pro, advil, aspirin. 
>> Ibuprofen is best. Liquid advil is best. Hits the system a little faster. You despif yourself of vitamin b. You lose that in the liver in the system. Take a tablet of that. Al can sellers. Will make you feel a little bit better. GUYS YOU JUST NEED SOME Zs. Get a little sleep to cure the hangover. 
Brian: Take off the beer goggles. Put on the night mask. 
>> Somewhere in here you will find a great thing. I like coconut water, banana and vitamin b. I feel 100% better. 
Brian: If you want to catch pam go downtown. 
>> The dead rabbit. Open in new york city in few weeks. Catch me there. 
Brian: Irish bar owners. What do they th of next. They get us drunk and get us sober. 
>> Hope you all feel better today. 
Brian: You hear that steve? We talked about ketel one, talk about absolute. Waiting until absolute last minute to pass a deal. Are americans getting a wrong deal because they couldn't finish their job on time? Senator lindsey graham is next. As you wave good-bye to 2012. Say good-bye to this. "Gangnam style". He says he will never dance to it again. I guess he will go to the hustle on the bump. People snapshot progressive, but don't just listen to me. Listen to these happy progressive customers. I plugged in snapshot, and 30 days later, I was saving big on car insurance. With snapshot, I knew what I could save before I switched to progressive. The better I drive, the more I save. I wish our company had something this cool. You're not filming this, are you? Aw! Camera shy. Snapshot from progressive. Test-drive snapshot before you switch. Visit progressive.Com today. 

[03:44:41]


Steve: Fox news alert. Vice president joe biden made a late-night arrival on capitol hill to help clinch the negotiations to avoid a fiscal cliff but senator McCONNELL SAID THIS. 
>> Shouldn't hav taken us this long to come to an agreement and this shouldn't be the model for how we do things around here. 
Steve: I think that's an understatement but should he have had to come at all, the vice president and did the negotiations have to take place behind closed doors? Our next guest says no. Joining is south carolina senator lindsey graham. Senator, good morning to you. What time did you get back to bid last night? 2:45. I watched clem son game. Go tigers. 
Steve: What happened last night in the senate? 
>> It is result of dysfunctional senate. As 100 senators had privilege to the house bill, jeb hensarling said earlier, we should have taken up the house bill weeks ago and voting on rates and spending. Everything comes to the senate to e. It is dysfunctional place. Doing the stuff behind closed doors will stop. If you think you will get the debt ceiling raised coming out with a plan about an hour b it expires, and ask all of us to vote for it you can forget it. These days are over. 
Steve: What do you think is going to happen in the house? They will be open for business today. No guaranty they will take it up. Under the hastert rule they may not even do that. But, you know, we heard from jeb hensarling. He said there will have to be some amendments and it has got to address spending. 
>> Do the best you can. Make it better if you can. But here's reality. Right now all tax rates have gone up on all americans. The death tax went from 35 to 55. Passing a bill in the senate means nothing unless it is signed by the president. The defense department is on its way to being destroyed. There is just a lot of bad things will happen if we don't get this right. To my friends in the house. Make it better if you can. You need to understand this. If we don't get this tax rate problem fixed for all americans, the economy is going to collapse. The stock market will go down. The defense department will become unraveled. We're going to get blamed. In about two weeks into this we'll fold like a cheap suit. So what I would advise my house guys to do. Make it better if you can. Save your powder for the debt ceiling fight. Work with me and others never to raise the debt ceiling again unless we address why we're in so much debt. Never do a debt ceiling increase until we save social security and medicare from bankruptcy. And get this country off the road to coming greece. That is where we have leverage. That is where we should go to next. 

[03:47:21]


Steve: I heard you say it never raise the debt ceiling again unless you get those things. I remember the current president of the united states when he was a senator said, I can't vote to increase the debt ceiling. He changed his tune on that. 
>> He is such a small-minded guy in big times. The only reason we don't have a big deal or anything on spending because barack obama does a pep rally during the negotiations. He will spend every dime you give him. This guy is big government liberal. Only big idea every embraced is big government. Stimulus, obamacare. We'll make him historic president whether he wants it be or not. Social security and medicare are going bankrupt. The debt ceiling is a chance to get those programs out of bankruptcy and put the country on a path to sustainability. We borrowed 2.1 trillion in august of 2011. We spent 2.1 trillion in 17 months. We're burning threw money. Every child in america born owes $51,000 on the date of their birth. And that is unacceptable. That is going to stop. We're not going to raise the debt ceiling again and borrow aunabout much more money until we address why we're going protect as a nation. 
Steve: Senator graham, I was talking to one of my neighbors that works on wall street. He says given the inaction up on capitol hill regarding the debt and long-term entitlements we're cruising to get downgraded again by the rating agencies and that will have a ripple effect on our economy for a very long time. 
>> We're destroying the american dream. I've been here for almost 20 years. I have never seen a better chance for republicans and democrats to come together, reform entitlements in a way to save these programs, in 2037 the debt will be twice size of our economy. The good news we're one big deal away from dominating the 21st century. The bad news is that deal is elusive. We have leverage in the debt ceiling to make this president face up to the fact that we're spending our way into oblivion. Most americans don't want to borrow anymore money unless we get their kids out dt and start saving programs that we're all going to need down the road like medicare and social security. This is the best chance, steve, I've seen since I've been in congress, to do something big. Mr. President, embrace bigby partisan ideas for the first time in your life. You will go down in history as historic president. Don't be so small-minded. Man-up here. Be the president that the country wants you to be. Do something with me and others to save this country from becoming greece. We're running out of time, mr. President. 

[03:49:51]


Steve: All right. They have televisions at white house. I have a feeling he will hear about that. 
>> I hope so. 
Steve: Lindsey graham, senator from south carolina. Thank you so much. And happy new year. 10 minutes now before the top of the hour. Coming up he is correctly predicted last two reseconds. What is in store for the economy in the next year? Most trusted name in trends is gerald calenti is here next with his 2013 predictions. Juliet:9:53 east c coast. Some quick headlines. Attention netflix users. Congress just passed a bill last week allowing netflix and other video sharing sites to share viewers history. Brian, you're in trouble. You will have the opportunity to opt in and opt out of the sharing feature. 

[03:53:52]


Brian: A lot of sports. 
Juliet: Say good-bye to "gangnam style". ?????? ??????. My arch nemesis, core reason singer psy, says he is retiring song of new year to focus on his next big disaster song. I mean, hit. 
Steve: Good luck to him. 
Brian: Correctly predicted everything from the collapse of the soviet union to the dot-com melt down and even last two recessions. 
Steve: Found of trends research institute is here for his predictions for 2013 is gerald salenti. Good morning to you. 
>> Good morning. 
Steve: This is party time. There is lot of gloom and doom out there. 
>> People want to boogie before the lights go out. They're tired of this stuff. It is, there was no election bounce. After the election things went to a dud. Physical cliff hit. Tragedy in newtown. You're looking at news this morning about war games. Isn't that wonderful? 
Steve: In iran? 
>> Looking at millenial generation. They're getting out of school with mountain of debt and no future in front of them. They're saying enough. I want to have a good time. We're drawing parallels. The crash of 1929 the great depression, currency wars, trade wars, world war. You go back to the that time it was happiest hottest time in american music. People are swinging. We're in the mood. We'll see the same thing start happening. People know in their bones that things aren't right. They want to have a good time. 
Steve: Live it up now while you can. 
>> There will on changes in music, fashion, entertainment. 
Juliet: Will wet get back to swing? 
>> It is something new. Never comes back the same. 
Brian: Let's talk about the economy. Your prediction? 
>> More of the same but worse. The only thing that is keeping this economy going, everybody knows it, cheap money. Interest rates near zero. I just bought a building. 

[03:55:56]


Brian: Keeprinting money. 
>> Just bought a building in upper town kingston, colonial kingston. Got a mortgage, 3.25%. They covered closing costs. Locked in for 10-year. 
Steve: Giving money away. 
>> Exactly. By printing all the money they're devaluing the currency. Not only the united states, the new prime minister of japan, came in, bank of japan, print more money. European union, print more money. They're just dumping money into the system. It is not regeneratings on its own power. That is why it is going to go down. 
Juliet: Number three, steve, go ahead. 
Steve: Something we saw a lot of after the election, people were interesting in their state seceding from the union. 
>> One of our top trends last year, secession obsession. This year is is progress. There are 250 secession movements going on around the world, not only in the u.S. This isn't a bunch of right-wing nuts. These are people had it with the federal government look what is going on. Look at this physical cliff drama. The d.C. Drama queens. Who could make this up. 
Steve: New millenial education is? 
>> Will be moved. Their minds are wired different. The system is industrialize age mentality. Kidses are learning different way. They're not only wired differently in tms of technology, their mind are wired differently. The education system has not got into it yet to develop a new one. It will be a huge business. 
Juliet: That's true. 
Steve: The founder of trends research institute. Gerathank you very much.

=======================================================

>>> They were the marco polos andy the magellans of our time. Last september they bid farewell to a modern day columbus. 
>> It was a test meant to all-americans of what can be achieved through vision and dedication. >>Ca but that eulogy for the first man on the moon delivered by the last to leave it captures the spirit of all those who made that journey. >> ?????? let me see what spring is like ?????? 
>> american heros whose final missions ended 40 years ago. I'm neil cavudo reporting from the visitor space center in florida. It is hard for people my age to believe that most americans weren't even alive last time a manl walked on the moon. Apolo 17 astronaut on december 14th, 1972. A number of the explorers who made that trip have passed away. The rest are now in their late 70S AND SOME 80s, BUT THE Story they tell still sounds like something out of the future and not the past. It is a story about how america with a combination of vision and high-tech know how and good old-fashioned courage answered the challenge of a rival and stepped into the unknown and achieved what seems a unbelievable today as it wasun a half century ago. IT WAS OCTOBER 4th, 1957 At the height of the cold war that the soviets launched a beach ball-sized satellite named sputnik which orbited in a n hour and a half. 
>> They tell us the world may never be the sames again. 
>> In 1957 when I was still in flight school, sputnik was launched. That was the beginning of the space age. 
>> The dawn of the space age was the start of the space race. America competing with the soviets for scientific dominance. But in a world where americans dug bombshelters and worried about missal gaps, science spelled national security. 

[00:02:08]


>> The cold war had been prolonged. It was going on. Nobody could really see an end to it.N there were all of the under lying risks of nuclear confrontation at the time. 
>> The next step in that race, manned launches that required a few good men, seven to start. 
>> There was 110 originally people selected by the air force and the navy to become astronauts. It widdled down to 32 after the interviews and things like that, 32 that went to the clinic. I was the only guy to flunk. 
>> How come you didn't pass the mercury physicals? 
>> I had what was known as a high bilirubin which is a pigment in your blood. With that they said, well, you are out. 
>> You said at a time when you were a little boy you can be with the dinasaurs or the -- you can be into dinasaurs or rockets. 
>> When I didn't get intohe per ruer key -- mercury program I said I was interested in rockets before those guys could spell it. 
>> Projectco mercury began in 1958 with the goals of putting a human in orbit and doing so before the soviets did. On that second count they failed. Three and a half years after the sputnik shock on april 12th, 1960 YOU 1 THE -- 1961 the soviets out paced the u.S. When a cosmonaut was the first in space. 
>> They beat us into orbit. We were behind. We were lagging. 
>> America scrambled to catch up. Less than one month later on MAY 5th, ALLEN SHEPHERD, One of the mercury 7 was one of the first americans in space. Just over three months into his presidency john f. Kennedy, like millions of other americans across the country was glued to his television. C 
>> allen shepherd became an instant hero this country needed. But the fact is he circled the earth a month before and allen came up and went down 16 minutes. 

[00:04:11]


>> Yfk's sights on beating the the -- jfk wanted to beat out the soviets. He sought out scientist. 
>> President kennedy here with missal expert van bron started a tour of u.S. Space centers. 
>> I read a letter from van bron that he wrote to kennedy when he said, how can we beat the russians? The letter said we can't beat them anywhere except be the first on the moon. That's what we committed to. 
>> MAY 25th, 1961 THE President made a dramatic announcement before a joint session of congress. 
>> I believe this nation should commit itself to achieving s the goal before this decade is out of landing a man on the moon and returning him safely to the earth. 
>> We didn't go to the moon to coect rocks. We went to the moon to stick the flag in the moon before the russians did. 
>> If we didn't have the cold war, would kennedy have had the same zeal? 
>> No. 
>> To have something that would show america's ability to respond to a challenged as well as tdo do it in a full, open and peaceful way I think really did catch the imagination of the american people c and of the politicians at the time. 
>> Catch the imagination it did. 
>> We are underway. 
>> ON FEBRUARY 20th, 1962, John glenn became the first american to orbit the earth. 
>> Oh that view is tremendous. 
>> We choose to go to the moon in this decade and do the other things not because they are easy, but because they are hard. 
>> The mercury program would ultimately have six manned flights. Each mission a step closer to the ultimate goal. Then as mercury was winding down on november 22nd, 1963 president kennedy was assassinated. 

[00:06:16]


>> To honor his memory and the future of the works that he started, the nasa launch operation center shall here to be known as the john f. Kennedy space center. 
>> In april 1964 nasa launched project gemini. 
>> The gemini was started and it was a two-man spacecraft. The gemini program was specifically to show that we could do a rendezvous and dock. 
>> In order to get to the moon you had to have capability of two weeks in space. You had to beke able to rendezvous. You had to be able to do eva, get outside the spacecraft in a spacesuit, and you had to have a guided re-entry. We practiced all of those missions in gemini. So p gemini was an extremely important part of the lunar program. 
>> Onim june 3rd, 1965 on gemini 4, astronaut edward white was the first american to perform an eva, extra vehicular activity, or spacewalk. 
>> I feel like a million dollars. 
>> America was still playing catch up, however. Soviet cosmonaut performed a spacewalk three months earlier. The big prize was still up there in the night sky, and the gemini missions were moving forward. Each one providing nasa with more information necessary for that ultimate quest. 
>> We are on our way, frank. 
>> In december of 1965 gemini 7 rendezvoused with gemini 6a in orbit. Making it the first manned spacecraft to do so. Gemini 7 also doubled the amount of time any man had been in space. 
>> Many doctors at that time said, you know, people can't live in zero gravity for too long. Of course we went up there for two weeks, and we did see some changes in the body, but it was nothing that couldn't be overcome. 
>> That was significant, right? That meant that we could go to the moon, that we could chance a mission of that duration, if not longer. That changed people's perspective. 

[00:08:21]


>> The moon flights at max would be a two-week flat and we had to make sure -- flight and we had to make sure people could function in that respect. 
>> The 14-day mission has shown us that man indeed adapts to the space flight environment. Th te additional data allows us to medically commit man to a lunar mission. 
>> America's next step, the apolo program, would get us to the room, but apolo almost cratered as soon as it began. Fox news reporting continues after the break. 

[00:11:31]


>>> Everybody knew a moon mission was supremely dangerous undertaking. Still, few for saw astronauts actually dying on the launch pad, during a dress rehearsal no less. Just feet away from desperate technicians helpless to save them. ON T FRIDAY, JANUARY 27th, 1967 three astronauts entered apolo's maiden craft designated as204 to conduct a pre flight test. As test conductors were ready to pick utp the count ground instruments showed an unexplained rise in the oxygen flow into the space ship. Six seconds later the frantic voice of ed white came over the intercom. 
>> There is a fire in the cockpit! 
>> A fire in the cockpit. 
>> They were in a spacecraft in pure oxygen. That's a recipe for disears. All they needed was a spark, andee unfortunately they got one. 
>> From a piece of exposed, uninsulated wiring. 
>> Whyla couldn't they get out? 
>> T hatcho was on the inside pressing outward against the hull. So to remove the hatch you had to pull it in and turn it and then slide it through the door. Whenh the fire started you have 50,000 pounds of pressure holding it in place. 
>> All three men were dead. 
>> We lived near the wife of one of the crew members, pat white. 
>> He had the unenviable task of breaking the news to the wife of edward white. 
>> That was a pretty tough deal. When I stopped in front of the house she saw me coming, and even though she had not heard, I could just tell by the look on her face that she knew something was wrong. 
>> The three were given heros' funerals, and in their honor mission as204 was redesignated apolo 1. It could with el have been the last uh poll -- well have been the last apolo. 
>> That put the apolo program on hold. Frank boreman was instrumental in reviewing the whole issue. 
>> Nasa essentially investigated itself. That kept the outside people who had not the slightest idea what was going on at bay. Ite think that was one of the hallmarks really of the confidence that the public had in nasa at that time. We were able to get a team together and point out the failures and fix it. 

[00:13:49]


>> Boreman's testimony helped the convince the public that although there would always be risks and nasa can learn from it and it should go ahead. The launch pad disaster may have allowed nasa to get to the moon faster than scheduled. 
>> We had a opportunity to learn from that mistake, very frag jibing, sad mistake, but to actually accelerate the program. I am not alone in having said that the fire really did make it possible to meet kennedy's goal to land on the moon by the end of the decade of the 60s. 
>> Nasa never designated any flights apolo 2 or 3. Apolo 4, 5 and 6 were unmanned missions to test the safety of the rocket. It togeok almost two years before another american crew went into orbit. APOLO 7 ON OCTOBER 11th, 1968. The space program was back, but a slow re-entry wasn't going to be enough to meet jfk's deadline and beat t soviets. It would require a daring and dramatic change of plans. Coming up, nasa rolls the dice setting everything on number 8. 1968 was a year chaos and conflict in the united states. Robertot kennedy assassinated. And lbga's presidency and alienating millions of americans against a turbulent backdrop nasa resumed its flights and aimed to test in space the craft it hoped to learn before year's end. A sudden change of plans turned apolo 8 into another make or break mission. 

[00:18:57]


>> Apolo 8 wasn't going to be a lunar flight. It was going to be an orbital flight to test to see if everything was correct between two vehicles before we would ever commit them to go to the moon. 
>> Apolo 8 was a big step forward. Even if successful america would be trailing the russians in the race to the moon. 
>> The soviets sent a spacecraft around the moon with animals to see if they could send cause ma notes and try to beat us not for a landing, but at least beat us to around the moon. They were fairly successful. But then in the soviet hierarchy they had a big controversy. Should we send the cos cosmonauts, and others said no we should send one more time to make sure. 
>> The cia was getting signals that maybe the soviets were going to try a sir come -- a circum lunar flight. It would have massively under cut the pr potential of a lunar landing or even a lunar orbital flight. 
>> To make matters worse for nasa, the lunar module wasn't ready to go into space. It was months behind schedule. But instead of falling further behind the soviets, nasa officials hatched a bold idea. 
>> The lunar module unfortunately was delayed considerably. So nasa again in one of the great strokes of management substituted apolo 8 from an earth orbital flight to a lunar orbital flight. 
>> If it worked, america would actually leap frog the soviets in the space race. An astronaut, not a cosmonaut would be the first to fly around the moon. 
>> I think it was one of the first back gels -- gambles that n asa at the direction of the president took in order to establish that america was better than the soviet union. 
>> A big gamble indeed. After all, it was less than two years before that apolo 1 demonstrated how complex every mission was. How the smallest oversight could be fatal. Nobody knew that better than frank goreman, a p oi nt man in the investigation. Nasa taped him with the mission. 

[00:21:07]


>> I was called back, will you volunteer to take apolo 8 to the moon? I said yes, we would be happy to. We found out we would be going to the moon in august of 1968. 
>> We were sort of at the last minute, just several. Months before we were scheduled to launch, but that is what we were asked to do. Ours is not the reason why, but to do or die. 
>> Do or die not just for the three astronas. It was 1968 and it ended with a space disaster. It could end america's lunar requestsa -- quest to good. 
>> It occurred to me if it was successful we would be a monument to the failure. 
>> Apolo 8 launched pr kennedy space center in florida. 
>> We have liftoff. 
>> Just over two and a half hours later the crew was given permission to become the first humans2 to leave either orbit. Leave earth orbit. 
>> Using a state-of-the-art COMPUTER WITH ONE-13th THE Memory of a modern cal could you you -- calculater he launched and sent the craft hurling on the three-day journey to the moon. 
>> What does the moon look like? 
>> The moon is essentially gray, no color. 
>> As we came into earth rise, we were shocked, dumb founded almost to see this earth coming up. We hadn't seen it before. We weren't briefed about it. So there was a scramble for cameras. 
>> On christmas eve while orbiting the moon, this picture titled "earth rise" was photographed by the lander. This shot has become one of the most reproduced space photographs in history. 
>> That was the only thing in space that had any color. Everything else was black and white. The earth was blue with white clouds and continents. We were a long way from home and it was christmas. It was a very gnaw nostalgic moment. I think bill an deers said it best. He said, we came all the way to the moon and what really perked our interest was the earth. A 

[00:23:16]


>> somebody wants to credit me with it, I will take the credit. >>E the men in space are so meme ma rised by space. There are no lines in countries. 
>> It gives you a true perspective of our existence on earth. You look back at the earth and look how small it is, and how you could cover it up with your thumb. You realize we were so fortunate to have a body that was in the proper position with the sun with the proper mass and everything to allow life to begin. 
>> With the world engrossed in apolo 8's epic journey, the astronauts marked the holiday season by taking turns reading from the old -testament. 
>> God let the waters and heavens be gathered together in one place. Let the dry land appear, and it was so. And god called the dry land earth. 
>> Old -testament is the basis of many of the world's religions, not just christian. And so it affected most of the people that would be listening to us. Weth thought that was very appropriate. 
>> Level relayed a citing that delighted children worldwide. 
>> We have been informed there is a santa claus. 
>> Did your family just delay the christmas celebration for after you came back? 
>> Well partly, but I planned ahead of time and gave my wife a present that -- the card said "from the man on the moon." 
>> Show all of us guys up. 
>> Apolo 8 showed everyone up, certainly the soviets. While america was leading the space race, the end of the decade and jfk's deadline was quickly approaching. 
>>> Coming up, there was only one giant step to take on the pathway to the moon, and it would mark an epic moment in human history after this. 

[00:27:53]


>>> Welcome back. I'm neil cavuto coming to you from the space center in florida. President kennedy set the goal to land a man on the moon BEFORE THE 60s ENDED. Under president lyndon johnson the merchs caught up with the soviets and then passed them out right when apolo 8 orbited the moon, but no man had yet set foot on the lieu that are surface. Lunar surface. And when president nixon went into office the soviets were not about to get their first. The next leg of the space race was a series of sprints 
>> we launched a saturn 5 every two months, a remarkable achievement. 
>> Each mission got thebl astronauts a little closer to their ultimate goal. Apolo 9 launching march 1st and they were the first to test the lunar module in space. Apolo 10 launching may 18th, 1969 WITH STAFFORD, Young and sunik and flew within 50,000 feet of the lunar surface. That would be a dress rehearsal for the apolo 11, demanded by neil armstrong. 
>> What will your plans be in the extremely unlikely event that the lunar module does not come offff the lunar surface. 
>> Well it is an unpolicent sent -- unpleasant thing to think about and we choose not to think that at the present time. 
>> They would walk on the moon with arm stropping. 
>> There is a lot of gossip back and forth, buzz, about how it ended up neil armstrong was the first man. There was hope you were supposed towe be, right? 
>> There was an uncertainty. Every eva was done by the junior person. Th te senior person's responsibility has much more requirement. It would seem to me the outside activities should be the job of the junior person. 

[00:30:00]


>> Who is that supposed to be? Was it going to be you? Was it going to be armstrong? 
>> There is a lot of discussion about the commander leading his troops somewhere and the commander as a symbolic person. Neil was closer to the door, but I won't tell you which decision. 
>> It is weird, right? 
>> It is not weird. I went home and told joan, my wi frankly I just assume be on a later mission where i wouldn't have to put up with all of the celebrity sh making and rest of this for the rest of my life. 
>> JULY 16th, 1969, SHOW Time. 
>> You think about the countdown as the curtain opening. Worry is a wasted emotion. It clouds clear thinking that is absolutely needed when somethinghi goes wrong. 
>> The launch, another dazzling pillar of fire. The trip from the earth to the moon without incident. 
>> We have a happy home. There is plenty of room for the three of us. 
>> Anda then four days into the missionme came time to do what no astronaut had done before. Decouple the lunar module named eagle from the command module and guide it safely to the on. On their way down, armstrong and aldren realized they were going long, beyond the landing zone and into a boulder field. That's when armstrong took over. Diverting from the planned computer path, he was now flying above unfamiliar territory. He was searching for a safe spot to land while running low on fuel. 
>> So we are on the far side of what was undesirable, and i am reading the altitude. It is about a hundred feet. 60. 60 seconds. 60 seconds. 

[00:32:02]


>> Okay, a hundred feet and still a ways off the ground and we have 60 seconds. I'm getting a little concerned. 
>> So it got tense in mission control. We are biting our nails and holding our breath because we are running out of gas. I called eagle, 30 seconds and 13 seconds later on my stopwatch I heard contact, engineop. After a pause neil very calmly said, the eagle has landed. 
>> And I responded with. 
>> You have a bunch of guys about to turn blue. We are breathing again. Thanks a lot. 
>> The lunar module landed JULY 20th, 4:18 P.M. Eastern time. Six hours and 37 minutes later , neil armstrong took humanity's first step on the moon. What he said o might be the most famous words of the 20th ntury or any century. 
>> That's one small step for man, one giant leap for man kind.M, 
>> we said have you thought about what you are goingwe to say? "Well I don't know. When we land I will think about it." I nevert know when to take him seriously. 
>> Armstrong and aldren only spent a few hours on the surface, but it was enough time to bounce around and set up scientific experiments and collect moon rocks and take several famous photos. Aldren with the american flag, a footprint on the moon and probably the most iconic of all. 
>> Just walking and then he said, stop. Hold it. And I stopped and looked at himst and they took the picture. People haveur asked me what is the significance of this picture. I say I got three words, location, location, location. 

[00:34:05]


>> As a 10-year-old kid I am oking at you looking at that desolate place, and what was it like? 
>> Well, you used the same word I did, but I prefaced desolate with magnificent because of humanity's reaching outward and accomplishing something that people thought was impossible. 
>> Apolo 11 made it it to the moon six months ahead of the deadline jfk had set at the beginning of the decade. It was left to another president to congratulate the astronauts. 
>> One priceless moment in the whole history of man, all the people on this earth are truly one. 
>> President nixon planned two different speeches. One if you succeeded that you did, and one if you didn't. Fate has ordained the men wh entered the moon to explore and stay on the moon and rest in peace. These brave men, neil armstrong and aldren know there is no he with their recovery, but they also know there is hope foreman kind in -- for mankind in their sacrifice. That's if you didn't make it. 
>> It was pioneering. It was doing something that hadn't anywhere been done before. 
>> Armstrong aldren and collins splashed down on july 24th, 1969. The space race was over. Stars and stripes still there. 
>> Coming up inmi the 1960 there's was a hit tv show "lost in space" and a movie" marooned." As long as humans dreamed of exploring the heavens they shuddered at the possibility of never getting back. The astronauts of apolo 13, that nightmare almost came true. After this. 

[00:39:09]


>>> Imagine if I told you that next week or next month or next year americans would be landing on the moon. How huge would that be? So it is hard to believe that after apolo 11 the idea of going to the moon became almost old hat. After apolo 12 returned to the moon in nov of 1969 some people were actually feeling that these trips were getting routine. Then theorld was reminded starkly they were anything but. 
>> An analogy I use, the first time youut flew across the atlantic it created a lot of news, but now we got hundreds of flights across the atlantic, and nobody cares. But we h never lost our enthusiasm or our excitement because we knew what we were doing was very, very important ientifically. 
>> And of course plenty of astronauts still wanted their shot to walk on the moon. One was allen shepherd, the first american in space who had not been in space since that flight in 1961. 
>> Allen shepherd had len grounded for -- had been grounded for nine years. Wiser heads in management said, shepherd doesn't have that much training so far. We could either give him more training which would take 13 and he would get 14. 
>> Level had gone to space three times and/or bitted the moon would have a chanceo walk on the surface that much sooner. Apolo 13 launched at 1313 military time. It was set to enter lunar orbit on the 13th of april. But the crew, level, hayes and swagger were having nothing but good luck. The crew iniffed a broadcast showing how comfortably they lived and worked in weightlessness. 
>> This is the crew I of apolo 13. 
>> Nine minutes later, oxygen tank number two blew up causing the number one tank to also fail. 

[00:41:12]


>> Houston, we have a problem. 
>> Houston, we have a problem. Words that would be forever linked to commander jim level. 
>> When the explosion occurred , I thought to myself, why me? For a little while I couldn't believe what was happening. Then all of a sudden I said, well, it is me and it is now. So what's next? 
>> The command module's nor supply of electricity, light and water all lost. There was no heat source. They were 200,000 miles from earth and going in the wrong direction. 
>> Did you ever think I might die? 
>> Well, we thought our chances were about 10%. 
>> Did you really? 
>> Oh yes. When we realized after we saw theal oxygen escaping that things could be really bad. 
>> We have broken into space. 
>> As the world watched ground control in houston faced a formidable task. Think of a way for the crew to fix their space ship, test it and then write out step by step procedures for the astronauts to follow just to get home. 
>> We immediately went t the simulators to try to do in the simulators what they had to do in the damaged apolo 13 spacecraft to get them home. 
>> We are trying to come up th some good ideas for you. 
>> One was to shutdown the command module to conserve the remaining energy and use the lunar module. A it was used for shuttling the members to and from the moon as a life boat. 
>> We knew we had the lunar modute and it had power and the batteries and oxygen. 
>> But not enough. 
>> No. But if we could use it to get us back home again, but if notwe were going transmit as long as we could so that the people would have some idea of what to do to correct for future flights. 
>> You guys are doing real good work. 
>> So are you guys, jack. 
>> You sounded so calm, but you in particular, captain, sounded so at ease. If that were me I would be barney t fife. I am 200,000 miles from home. My space ship blew up, and m why not feeling optimistic. What went through your mind? 

[00:43:27]


>> A lot of people said you didn't understand the situation. 
>> Another crisis. Carbon dioxide levels were getting dangerous lehigh. Ground control fixed that by instructing the crew to build a makeshift rig they called "the mailbox" to purge the deadly gas from the craft and keep oxygen levels safe. This bought some time for the crew who were barely eating and running low on water. 
>> You think you lost 14 pounds? 
>> I didn't realize I lost 14 pounds. I guess I was all charged up. 
>> They were sick, freezing and tired. But they were safe for now. Mission control's next task was to get the broken down craft out of the lunar landing course and back on a free return to earth's trajectory. Engineers in houston figured the crew could do this by executing two separate burns or accelerations made from the limping command module. Towering that up after the long, cold fleet with one of mission's control's greatest achievements. W flat controllers generated the necessary procedure to do this in three days. Something t like that would normally take three months. 
>> We got smarter and smarter and smarter. Then it became let's don't make a mistake. 
>> People across the globe hoped for a miracle. They got one. The crew of apolo 13 splashed down safely in the south pacific ocean on april 17th. 
>> It was a failure in its initial mission, but in reality it was a try triumph in the ability of people to overcome adversity. Hat triumph likely gave allen shepherd, the man lovell switched flights with to walk on the moon nine months later. Shepherd made the moon his low gravity driving range launching two golf balls with a 6 iron he smuggled aboard apolo 14. 

[00:45:27]


>> I fantasized about landing on the moon, what I was going to do and how I would act on the lunar surface. 
>> But lovell would never get the chance to gok. 
>> So close and yet so far. 
>> Apolo 15 launched july 26th, 1971 WITH DAVID Scott, james irwin and alfred warden uh barred. Apolo 16 launched in 1972. It carried gong young, maddingly and charles duke. They were the first misons to use the lunar roving vehicle. But the apolo missions were winding down. Would maner ever return to the moon? The astronauts of apolo 17 certainly hoped so. Their amazing and what would turn out to be final mission AFTER THE BREAK.-??]??9???????? L@??o N????wyg??!nB w w wt<@m=m=m=o?>??kFokDr 

[00:49:33]


>>> Not long after neil armstrong made his giant leap foreman kind a new expression entered our lexicon. If we can put a man on the moon why can't we -- fill in the blank. Keep gum from sticking to our shoes. A joke, yes, but it showed how americans viewed the apolo as the ultimate human achievement up to that point. Or will it be for all time? Have I been asked a million times how does it feel to make that first step on the moon? I knew when I made that first step it was mine. Nobody could take it away from me. 
>> Yet h almost gave up that chance. He had done almost everything an astronaut could do and even buzzing the moon in apolo 10, except he never set foot on the lunar surface. He turned down serving as apolo 16 hoping to command a flight of his own. There was no guarantee there would be an apolo 17 or he would be on in it. 
>> This is the last of the moon landings, buts not the least. It has to be the best. 
>> That's the way we feel about it. 
>> His crew, the first nonmilitary trained astronaut. The launch, america's first ever at night took place on DECEMBER 7th, 1972. The flight went smoothly. While looking back at the earth schmidt snappedt this photo, now known as "the blue marble picture." 
>> Wehe had our view of a nearly full earth.Ur I too took that from about 34,000 miles away. Nasa tells me it is still the most requested photograph from theaw apolo archives. 
>> Apolo 17 arrived to the MOON ON DECEMBER 11th. And during the dissent to the surface, they learned that being in command while an honor is also a heavy burden. 
>> You had to change some things at the last second. 
>> That's right. But you can't push the stop button and say, oops, we have a problem. Let's talk about it. 

[00:51:33]


>> You get down to 200 feet and we got within what we call the dead man's curve. If the decent engine failed you cannot stage fast enough to fire the engine and go back into orbit. One way or the other you will land. And then when I touched the surface, a blue light that says shut the engine down because if you landed with the jenin burning it is possible a back pressure could have exploded the engine. Of course, it ruins your day. 
>> Yeah. 
>> And you press the button and boom. Then you feel positive gravity. The first thing I remember is looking out at this mountainous valley and realize that I am now where no human being haous ever been before. 
>> That's beautiful. It has to be one of the most proud moments of my life, i guarantee you.An 
>> the total time we were outside thtae spacecraft was 22 hours. That's the longest of any crew outside the spacecraft. 
>> You wanted to be out there on the moon all the time. 
>> Jack schmidt and ron evans had never flown before. I said you only come this way once. 
>> N ?????? I was strolling on the moon one day ?????? 
>> enjoy. They did. I did. We bounced around, but it was a natural response tour environment. >>Po hippity-hoppity. 
>> And going out longer and staying out longer left them exposed to the moon elements. Every minute they spent outside involved risk as they soon discovered with the lunar rover. 
>> He hooked the hammer on the fender and broke it off and the dust was raining down on you and the equipment and everything like that. 
>> And on the moon dust squalls disaster. 
>> Dust affects the thermal absorption of your suit and you get warmer. You use up the cooling water faster. 
>> In the direct sunlight the temperature of the moon's surface rises well above the boiling point. 
>> It took some time, but we clamped a new o dust flap made of taped together photographs that worked extremely well for the rest of the mission. Needless to say we were honorary members of many automotive repair associations. 

[00:53:41]


>> You had a couple of close calls there. You got dust on your spacesuit and could have burnt up. 
>> When you leave the earth you put yourself in a new environment of risk. People said you had a lot of guts. I didn't have guts. I knew what I was doing. I didn't go to the moon not to come back. 
>> And soon enough it was time to come back, but not before the sight of the earth blooming with color, atmosphere and light in a cold, black sky profoundly affected him. 
>> I promise you if I could take every human being with me for five minutes, stand them next to me on the surface of the moon and look back at the earth, the world might very well be a better place to live in. There is no question in my mind that there is a creator of the universe. 
>> Once you are exposed and see what you see, there is no atheist in space. 
>> There is nothing that created dust particles and then eventually life. It is inconceivable. 
>> ON DECEMBER 14th, 1972 After collecting almost 250 pounds of lunar samples, the most of any crew, the mission was over. 
>> I started up the ladder and I looked down at my final foot print and I knew I wasn't coming back this way. I looked at the earth and multi color blues and the oceans and the clouds and not tumbling through space, but with purpose and an order and turned on an axis and started up the ladder. I was looking for that perverbial freeze button because I wanted to keep this moment going. 
>> America's challenged of today has forged man's destiny of tomorrow. 
>> You were the last human being to touch that surface. How does that make you feel? 
>> Humble. 
>> We leave what we came and god willing that we shall return. With hope for all mankind. God speed to the crew of apolo 17. 

[00:55:57]


>> I am convinced that the space program will come back. 
>> The country needs to have something to look forward to, to look up to, to be proud of. Look how far we went in seven years. My grandmother on a farm in michigan had a ring telephone, no electricity, an outhouse, and she watched the first guy walk on the moon in her lifetime. 
>> I would like to see the next generation leave footprints like we left on the moon. 
>> I hope that happens some day. 
>> It has been 40 years since we left the moon. Most of the apolo astronauts thought that wee would go back or reach for even more distant goals. After all, that is the very nature of civilization, to continually build on our great accomplishments. Yes the space program has continued and yes the technology of the space shuttle and the mars rover dazzling. But we have never equaled the jaw-dropping human accomplishments of apolo or captured the imagination of younger americans in quite the same way. And with our national debt now nearly reaching to the moon, it is kind of hard to see taxpayers spending much on space flight anytime soon. But maybe, maybe by spending a little time looking back, we can at least learn a new the lesson that apolo showed us. If we americans set our sights on a goal and summon the collective will to achieve it, even the sky isn't the limit. I'm neil cavuto. Thanks for watching. ??????

=======================================================

Everybody paycheck ace affect whether you are on the right or left. We will all in this boat. We will following the fiscal cliff, all morning. We have put it all on my fox philly.Com. 
>>> Okay. Well, it is most famous new years celebration of them all and it certainly didn't disappoint 
>>> more than 1 million people is expect rang in 203 pie hing the ball drop in new york city's times square. A billion more if you can even imagine watched on tv. Crystal ball is covered with more than 2,000 waterford crystal triangles. 
>>> Of course, fire works went off at penns landing for those who could not wait this will midnight. They did that at 6:00 there was a second show at 12:00. The it was also a big hit this new years eve. 
>>> Now this is certainly a philadelphia tradition, and just a few hours, hundreds of thousands of people will flood the city to watch the the mummers strut up broad street. We saw costumes lined up in a row. He had was all business. Instruments tuned, costumes pressed and final fittings and finishing touches on these famous floats. While mummers may be a new years thing the most in south philadelphia this is a year round, life long affair. 
>> It is in your blood. You associate witt music. It is a feeling that runs through you. It is incredible. 
>> Mummers parade kicks off at 10:00 o'clock this morning. Sue, we have a little sneak peak yesterday here on good day as we had our cheese stake drop, yesterday morning. They here. 
>> Every where I went people were talking about the the cheese stake drop. They loved the cheese stake drop. 

[00:02:00]


>> One thing that may have to go next year in 2014, the confetti. Our producers worked hard to cut it up. When I walk home yesterday, to my car, I mean you could see confetti as one of our guys said, charles, it is all the way to penns landing. 
>> It went sideways it never fell down, because of the breeze. That didn't work out too well. 
>> Other than that. 
>> Everybody loved the cheese stake drop, including us, it was great. Thank you to the quaker city string band for coming by yesterday. That was yesterday, this is today our first forecast of 2013. Here's a look at our temperatures, they are much milder then they were yesterday at this time. We have had warmer air move in overnight and we have a lot of cloud cover out there so we don't expect temperatures to move a whole lot today. 40 degrees is right now in philadelphia and trenton and wilmington. Thirty-one mount pocono. It is 43 in cape may. We have a breeze. The it feels chillier, 34 is our wind chill here in philly. Thirty-four in wrightstown and wilmington. Feels like 19 in mount pocono at the moment what kind of new years day are we going to have? Well, hopefully a fun one for you but don't look for a lot of sunshine. 37 degrees by 8:00 and then with just a few peaks of sunshine by noon about 38, so that is what I mean temperatures will in the move much at all. Upper 30's, maybe top off at 41 degrees by the end of the day. So mummers parade will be a chill a fair.

>> To everybody this this roomy wish you a big ring on that fixer in the near future and then, hail to the eagles, baby, thank you. 
>> I think that is the best case scenario for the way to go out he did it with grace, dignity, and with a smile. Bottom line is andy reid is out as head coach of the eagles. So search is now on for a replacement, jeffery lurie is wasting in time drawing up names for the position. Fox 29 learned a few names includes bill o'brien, atlanta falcons coordinate or dirk cutter, 49ers coordinator greg roman, colts defensive coordinator bruce arians and chip kelly.

=======================================================

>>> Good morning on this tuesday, january 1st, of 2013 I'm sheneille jones in for karen hepp. In the 11th hour congressional leaders in the white house reach a fiscal cliff deal, we will say they are, close to it, we are following the the overnight development. 
>>> Plus feathers, sequence and those famous string band once again fill broad street, we will have have all details, of course, on today's mummers parade. 
>>> Also the search for a new head coach, begins, we will tell you who eagles are eyeing up as andy reid's replacement. We will get to our top stories in a moment but first happy new year. I'm wondering if people are still up, I are just waking up, or what they are doing at 5:00 o'clock on this news day. 
>> Exactliy had aacebook message from one of of our friend named misty and I said up early or late. She said, late. Still up. And, we had a lot of activity outside our building this time of the day when we usually come in and nobody is around. It is crazy outside. Just take it easy and stay with us, relax if you have the day off, we will let you know what is going on and try to have fun as well. We will start off with our current temperature at philly international, 40 degrees, feels like 34. Little breeze out of the west at 9 miles an hour. And your happy new years forecast for today, 37 degrees by 8:00 o'clock. We will stay in the upper 30's, lower 40's all day long. May get a few peaks of sunshine but generally expect a mostly cloudy day, high of 41, 42 degrees, something like that for the parade, it looks like it will be a cold one. That is your winter weather authority forecast for january 1st and let's see what kacie has going on with traffic. 
>> Well, sue there is not much traffic. City avenue was closed due to an accident overnight, that has just reopened right around presidential boulevard. Don't worry about that and don't worry about anything on majors. Things are moving along which they should be this early in the morning but there are a lot of people and cabs out. Fifteenth street at vine street there is an accident there. Next hatfi bethlehem pike at east walnut the street an accident there as well and as far as the parade steer clear of broad street northbound side, and up to jfk boulevard. That is route of the parade, sheneille, yes. 

[00:02:22]


>> I love your serious face with the 2013 on your head. Fantastic. 
>>> Senate overwhelmingly approves the country from going over the fiscal cliff and now house of representatives will have their say on the matter. Lets go to steve keeley live in the news room with the late breaking details. You are holding out on your optimism on this first day of the new year because we just can't tell. 
>> Their vote is always in question or in doubt to the even the the speaker of the house himself, remember plan b earlier this month. So the cliff hanging continues through the the holiday and past midnight deadline. Which it turns out doesn't seem to have been a hard line deadline after all, does it. 
>> Most power priority was to protect middle class families this legislation does. That h middle class families will wake up today, to the assurance that their taxes won't go up $2,200 each. They will have the serbty to plan how they will pay for groceries, rent, car payment, all during next year. 
>> Reporter: If this bill passes as is in the house of representatives, taxes will in the go up for 98 percent of all americans, just the wealthiest 2 percent, those who make $400,000 up. 
>> I feel really, very, very good about how this vote will go but having been in the senate for as long as I have, there is two things you shouldn't do, you shouldn't predict how the senate is going to vote before they vote, it won't make a lot of money, and number two you surely shouldn't predict how the house will vet but I feel very, very good, I think we will get a very good vote tonight but happy new year and I will see you all maybe tomorrow. 
>> Reporter: So the house could vote as early as today but may change it and send it back to the senate first or even vote against it still. So the worry is not completely over yet to start this new year. 
>> I'm disappointed that we weren't able to make the grand bargain as we tried to do for so long but we tried. If we do nothing, the threat of the recession is very real and it does not mean it is halt, far from it. We can all agree is there more work to be done. I thank everybody for their patient is today and they have had a lot of patients. 

[00:04:38]


>> Reporter: These grand bargains never get done they turnout to be quick fixes and this deal, sheneille just balloons government spending at all. It does nothing as it was intended to do it makes no sense. That is why some members of the house of representatives will say, why are we doing this, no deal, is probably better than this bad deal. That could come out of the house today. The it is anybody's guess, 2 million people if this passes will still get those unemployment checks that are vital. They are their last life line and that is money as they start the new year with a new job search. A one year extension of long term unemployment checks was in this package. Not in it a little talk about thing that doesraise everybody taxes. I can't believe this is not in the news, 2 percent cut in the payroll tax cut was allowed to let expire. That means a 2 percent tax hike for everybody. 2 percent out of your next paycheck. It was passed a few years ago to help revive the economy. That, to this reporters still needs a lot of reviving but apparently not enough to keep payroll tax cuts in this package. Brave senators, sheneille, also at the last minute made wise decision to stop their $900 pay hike they were going to get march 27th, how nice and considerate, they will have to live off of that measly 174 grand a year they make in salary. 
>> I was actually surprised how we didn't talk bit as much as we thought we would was that pay raise. A lot just think there is so much to this whole fiscal cliff some think they are getting by people like theyroll tax. 2 percent is significant. 
>> There is in spending cuts being talk about and that was the whole point, of this whole thing. I'm not saying they should have let it go and cut the whole military budget but where are spending cuts. That is key question when this gets out to the republican controlled house of representatives. 
>> Well, we will talk more bit as the morning continues, thanks, steve. 5:06. White house and congressional lead's greed to the extension of the 2008 farm bill which expired in october. The extension is good through september and it only includes certain portions of the bill. Among them the milk clause, we talk about this on good day that prevents price of million from being potentially doubling up to $8 a gallon. 

[00:06:51]


>> Five, four, three, two, one... 
>> The most famous new years celebration of all, certainly this didn't disappoint this year, more than 1 million people rang in 2013 by watching ball drop in times square, a billion more watched on tv, the crystal ball is covered with more than 2,000 waterford crystal triangles. 
>>> This was the gorgeous fire works display, blasting off at the the stroke of midnight at pens landing in philadelphia. It was the second show of the night, there was also an earlier display around 6:00 o'clock for those who could not wait up until 12:00 o'clock or midnight. Ice was also a big hit this new years eve. 
>>> It is a philadelphia tradition that is more than 100 years old now just a few hours hundreds of thousands office people will flood the city in philadelphia to watch the mummers, strut up broad street. So yesterday, as you can imagine look at these costumes here it was all business in soh philadelphia, instruments were getting fine tune, costumes pressed and there were final fittings and finishing touches on the famous floats. While mummers may be a new years thing the most in south philadelphia it is a year round life licensing affair. 
>> Does it ever get old? 
>> No, it never gets old. When you turn city hall and see them lights, it is like all year this is what youwork for, four and a half minutes and you put it out there. 
>> Those mummers parade will kick off at 10:00 o'clock this morning. 
>>> We're going to be saying good bye to the winningest coach this is history of the philadelphia eagles. 
>> It is official, after 14 years the eagles are parting ways with head coach andy reid. We will talk more about that but first lets focus on search for reid's replacement which begins and jeffery laurie is wasting no time drawing up names for the position. Fox 29 has learned about a few names. This is big with howard eskin. It includes look at the top of the list penn state head coach bill o'brien. At plant falcons defensive coordinator dirkkoetter and greg roman and bruce arians and chip kelly. Nfl requires a minority candidate to be interviewed this list looks pretty solid. 

[00:09:15]


>>> As far as andy reid cardinals owner bill bidwell said he will interviewed reid for cardinals head coaching job. He faces competition for that position from at least two other candidates. 
>>> After being let go reid met with his team one final time. Many players tell us they are sad to see him go. 
>> You know, he came in, he was being released as the head coach. You know, it was an emotional time for everyone. The man put everything into this organization, this community and basically gave him a standing ovation. There is nothing you can say. 
>> We just feel like we let him down. That is the biggest thing. Just to see him stand up there and he has all of the heat for our failures on the field. You just feel like we let him down. 
>> It is something that he always said, you know, the day is always coming whether you get out before they can get you or not but he has done a great job here. Yes, it does hurt me because you never want to be a part of something that gets someone fired. 
>> That last game was just brutal, stinky. Lets bring in sue serio. I saw michael vick talking with the cameras. I have never seen him so frustrated. When we mentioned this yesterday some of your teammates are working harder than others that is just no way to play. 
>> Yes, they weren't a team. They just weren't a team. Fresh start and that will be the case for eagles as well. All right. I want to take a quick moment to say hi to christine and kevin baldwin, because they are celebrating their one month anniversary today. They got married december 1st. Isn't that sweet. 39 degrees in philadelphia right now. Same in wilmington and trenton. Forty-one dover. Forty-one cape may. Milder temperatures then yesterday because we have had cloud cover. We have wind chills in the 30's. Thirty-three is what it feels like in philadelphia up in the mountains it is colder, it feels like 19 in mount pocono. Today mostly cloudy breezy cold might see a bit of the spring this will morning or a flurry but it is in the real likely but we have a cold front coming through and after that happens its will be brisk and colder tomorrow with a high of 36 degrees. What happens after that? Well, here is your seven day forecast, we have temps in the mid 30's rest of the week, little bit of cloud cover on thursday but otherwise no major weather events. We've got just cold temperatures up until monday when we inch back in the 40's again. So that is what you got from your winter weather authority, oh, and kacie, I wanted to say hi to linda another facebook friends. I asked if she was up early or late. She said early because she has to to work. 

[00:12:10]


>> She's one of the 39 percent. 
>> That is right, we're all here. 
>> That is all right. She's with us. She's one of us. 
>> We love you. 
>> We're going out who hatfield, bethlehem pike and walnut street. This has been out there a half an hour. Use caution approaching that scene.

Details on today's pare. Lets look live outside our studios this morning, what is ahead for first day of 2013? Lets go to sue serio for a check of the forecast. I was talking to tom loudon and he was talking about how busy it has been all night in olde city. You cannot find a parking space. I assumed it would be easy. I could not believe it. 
>> Folks are making that party linger, longer, now it is 5:30 in the morning and, they are probably some of them are still out there but whatever it is if you are up early, still up from last night, nobody has as many see whence on than bus stop buddy. Mummer buddy, new yeary, cloudy and cold all day, starting with temperatures in the 30's and we will not see them move much. Upper 30's throughout the day-to-day. So layer it up, notice buddy has gloves on with his lovely, mummers costumes. Sunrise not until 7:23 and we will not see a lot of sunshine today, your fox cast has 37 degrees by 8:00. 38 degrees by lunchtime with peaks of sunshine but generally mostly cloudy skies and then it is a chilly parade because it takes all day, so upper 30's to lower 40's all day, high will be about 41. Is there your fox cast from the weather authority. It was I right, kacie did you love buddy's outfit. 
>> Difficult not see him because he was -- I was talking to tom loudon. 
>> Rats. 
>> See, sheneille always seeing the bright side of things. Next time is right. We will go out to 202 southbound side at route 100. We have a report of someone's joke from the vehicle here. A bad accident here. I do have my camera here. This camera the at 202 at 100. You can kind of see looking long enough you can see crews through the trees that they are out there. In word whether or not it is closed but it is southbound side of 202 at route 100. Now out to hatfield bethlehem pike at east walnut street. That accident is still out there. The as far as your majors go everything is looking good and moving along except for that little spot, 202 at 100, sheneille. 5:32. Lets get to your head lines. Senate has passed the fiscal cliff agreement and now it is up to the house of representatives. Lets get to steve keeley in the news room tracking late breaking details. 

[00:02:23]


>> You wand year so many people think d.C. And washington d.C. Stand for dysfunction and corruption. This is amazing. The house of representatives is up next and controlled by a republican majority. They could possibly vote today, maybe on that senate passed plan. It could change it, first and then send it back to the senate or may even possibly vote against it and start this flurry of worry all over again past the last minute deal making and all that other stuff. Here are latest and only two comments so far from those involved, in the senate side of the talks, from two leading democrats. The vice-president, and harry reid. Yesterday we were dealing with andy reid to day harry reid. They came in the middle of the night while rest of the country was either sleeping, out lighting fire works or filling in the streets and ringing in the new year. 
>> I have said all long our most important priority was to protect middle class families and this legislation does. That middle class families will wake up today to the assurance that their taxes won't go up $2,200 each. They will have the certainty to plan how they will pay for groceries, rent, car payment, all during next year. 
>> I feel very, very good about how this vote will go but having been in the senate as long as I have, there is two things you shouldn't do, you shouldn't redick how senate will vote before they vote and you won't make a lot of money and number two you surely shouldn't predict how the house will vote. I feel very good. I think we will get a very good vote tonight but happy new year and I will see you all maybe tomorrow. 
>> Reporter: People from both part writes not happy with this deal not just hard line conservatives and no tax hikes senators who were among eight no votes but two democrats including a local one delaware senator tom carper voted against this. While people making more than $250,000 are actually -- $400,000 will get tax hikes, they do start seeing their tax credits and deductions get phased out at $250,000. Where does this stand in the mind of the john bain shore said decision about whether the house will accept or amend measure will not be made until the house members and all of the american people have been able to review it. Translation, it is in the over yet and country is not out of the clear of the new year of worry. What we did was essentially pushed back these spending cuts, by like eight weeks, so come late february, early march another steeper higher cliff essentially was put up by these people who just put off the problem down the road again. At that same time, that is when we will face the next borrowing limit fight and remember how tough that was, we thought country was in the default and in the paying its bills. Big mess. They didn't solve anything. That fist they pass this thing which is in guarantee, whats some ever, when it gets to the republican controlled house of representatives. 

[00:05:20]


>> Kicking can down the street. Thanks, steve. 
>>> We will follow developments here on good day, all morning. Is there more coverage on our web site if you want more details as to what they are talking about here on my fox philly.Com. 
>>> In just a few hours hundreds of thousands office people will flood the city to watch mummers strut up broad street in philadelphia yesterday was all business in south philadelphia, they will take this seriously. They fine tune their instruments, press their costumes, everybody gets finishing touches on the famous floats. While mummers, it is a new years thing for us, it the is a year long life licensing affair for those in south philadelphia. Path are raid starts at 10:00 o'clock this morning. 
>>> If you are not going to the mummers and looking for something to do today here's what is opened. Mostly closed but some like adventure acquire number in camden, please touch museum, also something for your kids and philadelphia museum of art they are all opened today, all federal agencies, federal courts, state agencies, local, state courts, schools, libraries and recreational centers are closed. Trash and recycling will not be pick up, septa and patco lines as a heads up are running on holiday schedule today. 
>>> It was cold outside last night but a lot of folks still put on layers to watch fire works but what does first day of the new year in store weather-wise? We will have a look at your weather authority forecast and your traffic coming up. 
>>> Keep it here kim gar son will be here to talk about the foods everyone needs in their diet in 20 136789 so far we are doing okay, only 5:36. So far so good.

For tomorrow, with the fronl system moving through purchase degrees is the high temperature. The it will be colder and a little bit on the breezy side, on wednesday. What about the rest of the first week of the year, including weekend?

>> That is right, sue, we will go out to southbound side, route 100, you can see traffic still getting by blocking the right lane there. They didn't move camera. That is good news. It is off to the side. That was a pretty bad accident that is report we got. We will keep you updated on that but heading out you can still get by on the left-hand side. Next hatfield bethlehem pike at east walnut street. There is an accident there sticking around. As far as rest on the majors go everything is looking good aside from that 202 accident.

He took the team to five conference championship games and one super bowl in 2005 but since that soup are bowl eagles started to slip. Under jeffery lurie, he explains. 
>> I think we lost some of the exact nature of the method that we have all shared that created the success which was discipline, strategic thinking, don't do necessarily is what popular but do what is right. 
>> After being let go reid met with his team one final time, lot of the players will tell us they are just sad to see him go. 
>> I think the guys net is that new he is gone, you don't really necessity how serious it can be, so now he is gone. People just realized that, you know, lack of focus, lack of heart, in certain games essentially, it is in fully affect now. Now you feel sorrow for coach. It all comes down tour performance.

=======================================================

Well, why not might as well join the crowd. Temperatures in the 30's or wind chills in the 30's depending where you are, sunrisees at 7:23 this morning but don't expect to see a lot of sunshine maybe a few peaks but otherwise mostly cloudy, breezy, cold high of 41. Tonight we are down in the 20's we will be a much colder night then we had last night mostly cloudy skies. That is your winter weather authority fox cast for the first day of the year. We will talk more about the rest of the first week of the year coming up. 6:00 o'clock on the dot. 
>> We haveouthbound side of route 202 at 100. Southbound side is closed, we will go out there to take a look at. That closed a the boot road. Take phoenixville pike. This is a bad accident. Crews are on the scene getting that cleaned up. We will ep you updated on that. Septa regional rails is ing on a normal, regular sunday schedule so that is good news heading out and about right now. As far as your majors goes no incidents or delays. 
>> Kacie, I'm sure you heard about this just a few hours ago senate overwhelmingly approved an agreement to keep the country from going over that fiscal cliff. Now house of representatives will have their say later on today. 
>> Let's go to steve keeley to bring us up to dayton what is going on as we speak. 
>> Reporter: How about a reality check in all this. This deal does not the do much other than delay most of the 11 -- 110 billion in spending cuts for just two months. You have like 11 weeks before we have to go through this whole thing all over again and those cuts will to have get exchange for more tax hikes or cuts to things like social security and medicare. So doesn't that sound like another huge political fight, worry for most of the country, all essentially the senate did was delay this cliff and climb to a higher steeper cliff that the country will be hanging off of again in late february and earl I march where we will have another fight to raise the country's debt ceiling the borrowing limit so it can pay it its bills. Double whamy of worry is on the way still. 

[00:02:14]


>> Our most important priority was to protect middle class families and this legislation does. That middle class families will wake up today, to the assurance that their taxes went go up, $2,200 each. They will have the certainty to plan how they will pay for groceries, rent, car payment, all during next year. 
>> Reporter: If this bill passes as is in the house of representatives taxes will in the go up for 98 percent of all americans just people making $400,000 up. 
>> I feel if having this vote to go but having been in the senate as long as I have been, there is two things you should not do, you should not predict how senate will vote before you vote. You won't make a lot of money. Number two you should not predict how house will vote. I feel very good. I think we will get a very good vote tonight but happy new year and I will see you all maybe tomorrow. 
>> Reporter: So house could vote on it as early as today but may change it and send it back to the senate first or even vote against it still. So the worry is not completely over yet just to start this new year. 
>> I'm disappoint that ha we weren't able to make the the the grand bargain as we have tried to do for so long but we have tried. If we do nothing the threat of the recession is very real and passing this agreement does not mean negotiations halt, far from it. We can all agree is there more work to be done. I thank everybody for theirpatient it is day and they have had a lot of patients. 
>> Reporter: People with the most to lose are millions of unemployed people because they were wand fairing their last check would be their last under this package, 2 million will still get unemployment checks a lot long fur this passes giving them money to live on as they start a new job search in this new year. One year extension, of the long term unemployment checks in this package. In the in it, a little talk about thing that does raise everybody taxes. 29 percent cut in the payroll tax was allowed to let expire so that means 2 percent tax hike for everybody. 2 percent out of your next paycheck. It was passed years ago to revive the economy that still needs a ton of reviving if ask me but in the enough to keep payroll tax cut according to the senators who passed this plan and brave senators also at the last minute made the wise chest to stop their $900 pay hike they were going to get this spring. How nice and considerate of them. Now they will to have liv of 174 you this dollars a year. And again none of this is even guarantied to be approved by house of representatives where you can bet many of the republican majority will be so angry that this deal raises taxes and toss than the cut hardly at all and pushes hard decisions down the road a couple months in the new year just a few weeks and starting the year by creating a new higher cliff have combat in congress. This is no where near done, sheneille and mike. 

[00:05:12]

Penns landing, barge right from the middle of the delaware river there was also april earlier display for those who could not wait up, especially for the kids that was at 6:00 o'clock lt evening but this one you're watching happened right at midnight. River rink was a big hit this new years eve with a lot of kids a lot of families. 
>> Sure. 6:06. Feathers, music, and, of course, strut in just a couple hours people will pack city streets to watch mummers parade in philadelphia yesterday it was all business. They take this very seriously. Fine tuning their instruments, costumes, pressed finishing touches on the floats and all that good stuff. While mummers may be a thing for new years day this is a life long year round affair for some.

>> All right. First day of the year, lets take a look at ultimate doppter, because, we're showing just a little bit of activity on it, none of what you are seeing here in delaware and just right at the end of the loop is making it to the ground. Is there cloud cover. Is there a system passing by to the south. Here you can see it stretching all the way down through kentucky, and tennessee, as well, and this is a system that will move due east so it isn't expect to affect us with precipitation. Maybe a flurry, maybe a flake, maybe a rain drop or two but not too much going on with that. We did want to show what you was happening. Let's show you what is happening number wise around here we had 39 in philadelphia 40 in wilmington. Thirty-six in lancaster. Thirty-eight in reading. Thirty-one in mount pocono. Look the at the the wind chill it feels like 21 there. Feels like 33 in philadelphia. We will have enough breeze to make it feel colder then it is. Just 8 miles an hour. When it is really cold out every degree makes a difference. Forty-one is where we should get by end of the day. Maybe flurry up north and west with that system but for the most part just passed us by and leave with us colder air. The breezy and cold today but tomorrow, even with sunshine, it is colder, and mostly sunny skies for wednesday, but it will be a brisk one highs not getting out of the mid 30's, all day long, tomorrow. So seven day forecast has 41 today, 36 tomorrow. Thirty-six on thursday. And friday. Only 37 on saturday. Plenty of sunshine on sunday. Only 38 degrees. We will get up to 42 on monday. Rather uneventful and very cold first week of 2013. There is your seven day forecast from the winter weather authority, kacie.

Also closer to the city a slow down on the vine, nothing too crazy to worry about, guys. 

[00:33:15]


>> Thanks, kacie. 6:33. Lets look at your top stories, mike. 
>> New years takes a deadly turn in cobbs creek. Shots fired on the 5600 block of carpenter street, this is just after midnight. Police say one person is dead, there are in suspects at this time, incident, of course is under investigation by police. 
>>> Another deadly shooting in nicetown, this was the scene around 3:30 this morning in the area of 17th and venango streets. Three people were shot at a house, one man pronounced dead, two victims in the hospital. Police say one is in stable condition, other is in extremely critical condition n word on arrests or how it started. 6:34. Senate passed a fiscal cliff agreement and now up to the house of representatives. 
>> Steve keeley explain this, what was going on last night. 
>> Reporter: Mike, it was passed last night in the senate while we were all sleeping. What will go on is real worry and real concern because it is not a done deal. House of represent is not controlled by democrats like senate is and joe biden, the vice-president was sent into do this deal with harry reid and mitch mcconnell in the senate. He he hasn't talked to anybody in the house of representatives which could still vote begins this thing and start this flurry of worry past the last minute deal making all offer again. Expect to hear today's headlines dominated by republican congressman from planning that the senate deal is a bad deal, raising taxes and not cutting spending. Instead just push the big hard decision about hall of the big cuts two months into the new year when timing is way worse than right now, coming up at the same time as another vote, to raise the kent ceiling and borrowing limit for country so it can pay its bills and in the default. We remember that fight last year. That also went to the last minute before in a fight over cutting spending too. 
>> I have said all along our most important priority was to protect middle class families this legislation does that. Middle class families will wake up today, to the assurance that their taxes won't go up, $2,200 each. They will have certainty to plan how they will pay for groceries, rent, car payment, all during next year. 

[00:35:32]


>> I feel really very good about how this vote will go but having been in the senate as long as I have, there is two things you shouldn't do, you shouldn't predict how senate will vote before they vote and it won't make a lot of money and number you two surely shouldn't predict how the house will vote but I feel very, very good. I think we will get a very good vote tonight but happy new year and I will see you all maybe tomorrow. 
>> Interesting thing is one of the guys that was in the senate with him from delaware tom carper voted no, it will be great to hear his thoughts but he is in the talking publicly, probably sleeping. The problem here is this is just a big charade. While everybody is smiling and celebrating nothing has gotten done just yet because while harry reid is saying there is no tax hike for most of americans, there is a tack hikes. What was not included was payroll tax cut we had for two years for 2 percent. Take your last pay stub for this year 2012 and go with the next pay stub at 2013 you'll see he a raise in the payroll tax and so we all did get the a tax hike because they didn't continue. That you don't hear them talking aboutment that iis like they are too shy about it. What the senate bill does is just put problems on the higher, steeper, more slippery cliff putting unstable thoughts in the mind of say taxpayers, how about the tax preparers, they dent know how much tax to take out when you do your tax forms coming out and companies deciding whether to hire people or whether to because new equipment, it doesn't sound like much of a solution when you look at tonight reality terms. 
>> Probably have to extend the april 15th deadline this year, stuff like that, estate tax. 
>> How about people making $400,000 or more, paying almost 40 percent in taxes, back to the mid 90's. 
>> More details to come. 
>>> For teenagers getting a new gadget like an iphone would be a dream come true and men this case it is probably exciting but this 13 year-old in massachusetts is making national news thanks to his mother. I'm sure he is coolest kid in school. 

[00:37:46]


>> Crystal haines she's cool, one of our reporter, well, she has the story, here we go. 
>> Reporter: Merry christmas you are now proud owner of an iphone. 
>> I was last within of my friends to get a phone. They are like yeah, you got a phone. But there is a contract. 
>> He would have the world at his fingertips without my constant supervision which is part of the growing up and i was totally comfortable with that but I felt like I needed to get it on paper. 
>> Reporter: That is exactly what janel who have map d she gave her three-year old greg a simple choice. Adhere to this 18-point contract and get an iphone. 
>> It is just kind of put together all these rules which is in the being one of those strict parents, she's preventing me from dangers of getting myself in too much trouble where I could not handle. 
>> Reporter: Decision itself was in the so simple for mom of five, greg is the oldest. 
>> We are first group of parents ever parenting this kind of technology and there are no guidelines so we're relying on our common sense and instincts so I just compiled things I always want him know but some rules and structure around such a large gift. 
>> Reporter: Rules could be considered a gift themselves, some more serious like don't use it to lie, fool or deceive another human being or no porn. Greg has to give his phone 7:30 on school nights but or just plane life lessons hoffman wanted to share like listen the two bird, wander, without googling. 
>> Is there a part of me wanting to preserve his boyhood in that final rule about being one wonder to stair out a window without the iphone. Just don't always be plug in. 
>> Reporter: Speaking of plug in hoffman is getting feedback on her contract, some say, add rules like don't text and drive. Of course, greg is 13. Some are calling her a helicopter mom. But then there are those comments that say adults need a contract just like this one. I'm crystal haines, "fox news" you sure are, nicely done. 

[00:39:49]


>>> Are you making a new years solution? Just about everybody does. Their is never to wear that hat again. Coming up what you can do to follow through with your resolution this year. We have a tip for you. 
>> I'll take it. 
>> Plus andy reid already has a job interview lined up. 
>> What? 
>> Yeah, where big red could be heading next when good day re oh! Progress-oh! 
-Oh! -Oh! Oh! Oh! ?????? What do you know? ?????? oh! ?????? ?????? bacon?

Don't feel bad you are not loan. Most people end up breaking them after just a few weeks. Most people can hang on for one or two weeks but week three gets difficult. One psychologist has advice to make them more attainable. 

[00:43:03]


>> Most resolutions are typically vague, lofty, generic and they have in teeth. Instead of making a new years resolution what about a new plan for 2013. Plan for yourself to actually accomplish something. 
>> A you plan. 
>> That is what I need. 
>> The doctor says you should visualize end result close your eye and think bit, can you see it. 
>> Yes. 
>> Don't get to sleep new, you haven't slept, don't keep them closed to licensing. 
>> Think about steps you need to take to get your self to that place. Where are you right now? 
>> I'm back at the party. 
>> How is it. 
>> A little nutty here comes sueby. 
>> Visualize a cloudy day, you cannot see clouds just yet, it is still dark. Also, lets take a look at ultimate doppler because it looks like some showers are trying to move into the southern part of the viewing area. We have talk about this system that it will stay to the south, and just move eastward but it looks like we are on the outer edge of it. Most have the green you are seeing here in the last couple of frames in the loop are not, it is not precipitation making it to the ground but giving us cloud cover but if you are down in southern delaware, or maybe even at the jersey shore and you see a few sprinkles don't be surprised but it really won't be nug much to worry about at all. The lets check out our temperatures as we walk out the door, 39 degrees right now, 40 in wilmington. Thirty-eight in trenton. Forty-one in dover. Forty-three in cape may. This is what it feels like, feels like 33 degrees. Dress for wind chills in the 30's, that is how temperatures will stay, with that continued cloud cover. We don't expect temperatures to move much at all just a bit of the breeze at 8 miles an hour, 41 for our high temperature. Mostly cloudy couple peaks of sunshine possible but that their biopsies tempes giving us claus cover, breeze up and cold all day. Even colder tomorrow with more sunshine but a high of only 36 degrees. That takes us to the first or second day of the year. But, the kids I don't even want to mention it because they don't want to hear it, but back to school tomorrow. And 36 on friday and saturday. Bun will up all these days because early morning temperatures are going to be in the 20's so thinks a blast of arctic air that will be with us the rest of the workweek and then into the saturday and sunday as well. The first week end of the new year. Temperatures will in the get out of the 30's, finally inch into the the 40's, for monday. That is your winter weather authority seven day forecast, at least no big storms, kacie. 

[00:45:40]


>> In big storms, sue but a billing accident on the southbound side of 202. We will get to that in a second. Your majors are looking g you can see green every where, that is good news, right around, 7:00 o'clock. We are going out to this accident, southbound side of 202 at route 100, route 202 outbound side is closed from boot road to paoli pike there was an fatal accident there. Alternate would be phoenixville pike until they get that cleaned up. Crews are on the scene. They have been there for about an hour. Next we will go to hatfield a accident at swab road at west or villa road. Be on the look out for that one. We will go to your travel times and you can see anywhere you go you will get there on time, guys. 
>> Thanks, kacie, that is positive. 7:46. 
>> I think we lost some of the exact nature of the medicine odd that we have all shared that created the success which was disciplined, strategic thinking, don't do necessary what is popular but do what is right. 
>> Of course, that is eagles owner jeffery lurie talking about where it all went wrong. Mr. Lurie wasted in time getting to work finding a replacement for andy reid. Eagles have asked for and received permission to interview three falcons assistant coaches this week. Three of them. Our howard eskin reports that some of the names on the eagles short list are penn state head coach bill o'brien. Right at the top of the list. Dirkkoetter, don't you love that name, I'm dirk, from the falcons, greg roman from the 49ers, bruce arians with the colts. Boy he has done a great job. University of oregon coach chip kelly. Keep in mind that the nfl also requires a minority candidate to be interviewed before someone can be hired so a lot to look for a minority can tate as well. Stanford coach, I like him. 

[00:47:41]


>>> As far as andy reid is concern, arizona owner bill bidwell said he will interview andy for the cardinals job. After 14 years with the eagles many players are in the happy that andy reid is gone, but it sound like thermosly angry at their teammates. 
>> I think guys notice that now he is gone. They don't really necessity how serious it can be and now he is gone. A lot of us realized that a lack of focus, you know, lack of heart in certain games, it is in fully affect right now and you may feel sorrow for coach but it all comes down to your performance. Probably should have thought about that during the season and during the game. 
>> It is all about focus, dedication, commitment and until you get guys who are willing to better themselves, week in and week out and want to win, you ain't going to win. I refuse -- I just haven't played with guys like that. 
>> Wow, how about that. 
>> I remember back in the day when one of the top players on the team, especially quarterback would call out other players if they weren't showing any effort. Our hour eskin michael vick why he didn't do that earlier in the season, call him out. Michael said he tried to lead by example but... 
>> I will not tell a grown man anything twice. Reason I ended up incarcerated because people told me same thing over and over again and I didn't listen. If you don't learn on the first go round, then you are just disregarding it. You deal with the consequences. 
>> It looks like he is just so frustrated. 
>> Yeah, yeahy said it to sue earlier, if I'm trying and putting my life out there, seriously you have to do your part. 
>> Apparently he tried to do that and didn't get much response, that is why he kept saying I will not tell a grown man more than ones. 

[00:49:45]


>> If he did once. 
>> He called a team meeting. 
>> Do you remember that. 
>> Apparently it didn't work. We will talk to garry cobb. He is kind of old school eagles guy, I bet there were players on his team that would call other players out. 
>> Can you look and say that person you weren't trying your best, that person you don't have any heart can you look and see. 
>> Leave early, come in late, don't practice hard, stuff like that, yeah. 
>> We will talk to gar bye that.

>> Reporter: Even here in washington with the fire works comes new years resolutions so they got us wondering what do you suppose these guys are promising themselves for 2013.

[00:12:34]


>> Might we see golf course in the months ahead as warmer weather makes its way to washington? Only if the president extend the invitation and bob thinks he should. 
>> His resolution towards john boehner is simple include him in the golf game at least ones a month and they will get along famously after that. 
>> Andrea thinks it should just head west. 
>> President obama should spend more time in hollywood with george clooney and friends. Lessee spends in d.C. Less destruction he can do. 
>> What about john boehner's resolutions, he is often caught between members of his own party and trying to start 2013 with the unified front. 
>> I feel sorry for john boehner. The his real new years resolution to get rid of this tea party fringe people that give him a hard time but he cannot to that because they're electric. Next best thing is to quiet them town. 
>> Reporter: Whatever their commitment may be this is of course washington where resolutions just don't seem to last. 
>> Let me put it this way i wouldn't count on it. 
>> D.C. Has a habit of breaking promises. Did bob make a new years resolution to be nicer to me or anything like.

>> Put them on any kind of protein dish, chicken, fish, pork, beef, it is d >> I will say girlfriend of mine trying to help me out because she knows I cook. I was trying to help out with black eyed peas. She saute red and green pepper. And then put beans in. I think you have to have meat and all that good stuff. They are so good. 

[00:25:26]


>> Absolutely. 
>> Put them in eggs, omelette. 
>> Very good. 
>> Add color. Beautiful. 
>> We can commit to that. 
>> I just had raspberries earlier but I'm a fan of black berry. 
>> Taste it. 
>> You got me into these. 
>> I did, because they are pack with fiber. Everything that americans are really not getting enough of. This is naturally low in sugar. Also, but it is delicious. 
>> So sweet. 
>> We forget there is so many fine inner a blueberry and black berry. 
>> Exactly. 
>> Lower in sugar than other fruits. 
>> I think you can get used to it eating things like this and snacking on them when you have a can I bar it would be overwhelmingly sweet and then back to the real tiehl. 
>> Right. 
>> Make your candy. 
>> This looks like a honey crisp. 
>> That is by far, the best apple in my opinion, I love honey crisp apples. I could eat that for a meal. They are delicious. A little honey crisp with raw peanut butter and you are set full, delicious. Doesn't get better than that. And pack with fiber. They say an apple keeps a there away. 
>> Fiber. 
>> I could eat avocado on anything, sandwiches, omelets. 
>> It is so versatile. This is a good fat, one we all should be eating. Again, pack withutrients, and have one of those with the chips, it is outstanding. Of course, just take avocado and slice it. 
>> Yes. 
>> Perfect in the smooth I and make it creamy think you are eating decadent and yummy. 
>> Avocado with chocolate. It is delicious. You could make a pud ding with it and unbelievable. 
>> Really. 
>> We will dot recipe. 
>> Did you just mash this up, that is too good. 
>> That is quacamole. 
>> Okay. 
>> Yes, that is not avocado. 
>> No. 
>> I just opened up the avocado and scrape it up. 
>> Red onions, salt and pepper. 

[00:27:27]


>> Isn't that great. 
>> When I eat sushi I will eat the ginger raw and that is probably pickled or something. Is that okay. 
>> It is okay. Again this is something that is really common in the asian culture to use ginger. Some people, I think people have gallbladder disorders cannot have ginger because it causes problems. Contraindication was certain disorders but overall great thing to add as a addition tour meals. 
>> Greens, greens, greens, greens, cannot go wrong. Spinach is most versatile green. You can do so much witt. Nothing taste better than olive oil, garlic and saute spinach. 
>> Sound so good. 
>> If I could just commit to this you can do this we can do each one of these. 
>> You just to have commit to it. 
>> Kim, thank you.

>>> It is new dawn, it is a new day. Hey, the mummers parade starts in about 29 minutes. We've got to get from two street all the way over to there. 
>> Let's go to steve keeley along the parade route. 
>> We have better timing this time. The frog I group, the biggest winch group every all, 900 plus guys, as you saw, they were very festive. Little dangerous there. But just being unleashed. They have the best police escort, too, by the way. And the police always say, you know, we always have to have the most guys with these guys. Here come more police officers down the street. We will move. We have charlie stinson here, with the jokers group now, and they ghana little later. Charlie, explain the theme this year for you guys, midnight massacre aid. 
>> Midnight mascarade. It is a ball theme. And then we turn day at t end. Massacre aid ball, then it is day at the end. 
>> Looks like little james bond live and let die. 
>> Then the voo-doo let go on them. 
>> You guys are a lot better behaved than the last group that walked by, no drinking, no beers, no cursing, that's good. 
>> We start this in september, put a lot of time into this. So we want to make sure on our -- 
>> bees behavior? 
>> That's it. And very. Very polite, too? 
>> Catholic high school. 
>> That's good. And we have a good father right there, that's our dad. 
>> Look how young they start. Now, johnny, come here. Is is meredith cassidy and johnny, she works at our station, you see her if you watching at 4:25. Johnny, you guys boys three and six watch do they think of dad when they see him with this on his face? 

[00:33:41]


>> Gavin asked me is that you, daddy, I said yes, it is me. 
>> He likes it. 
>> These kids, there he goings. 
>> All right. This is little cassidy right here. 
>> All right, jackson. 
>> What do you think of this, this young -- 
>> fun, isn't? All right. Get the head nod from the little kids. 
>> Janice, come over here. All right you just watched this. You don't even go to broad street. You see enough here? 
>> No, we live on second street, we live right here on second street. You have a mini parade first here? 
>> Yes, mini parade, yes, then a big parade, then everybody and their father and mother comes down. 
>> This is big party at night watch time does the party end here on new years day? 
>> I would say about 1:00, 2:00 in the morning, yes.

>> Every year? 
>> Every year. 
>> This doesn't -- you don't get sick or tired of this? 
>> No, no, we love it, we love it. 
>> I want to give you a little question here. How long has this mummers been in an official parade in this town? Any idea? 
>> I think began in the early 19 hundreds. 
>> That's right, 1901. Good guess. And I put her on the spot. So you got a sense of this is like family, you start young, and you never end, you watch this, or you are part of this forever, and it is afield tradition. And here we are, 100 plus years, and you don't even have to be on broad street. You can see it on two street here without leaving your house. Look how clean this street is here. Lots of police, so they keep th order. And we got that last group at the start of the day. Can you imagine how festive the frogys will be because there is a party until 2:00 in the morning. You have a sense every them at 9: In the morning. 

[00:35:45]


>> What about meredith who looks like a model this morning, I think her mom makes the costumes. I'm wondering if she made her grandson's costumes? There is meredith stands right there. 
>> You know, sheinelle, here is another piece of trivia. Women weren't even allowed to be in this parade until the 70s. All the win. 'S, all the costumes, yes, male so far ennis I can. But it sounds kind of odd, no women, until the 70s, but that's how it was in this town. Women's liberation came through for the mummers. Observation look at them. 
>> Awe.

>> If you had tried to put that newspaper on there. 
>> It never would have worked. 
>> All right. Say you're going to the airport. Five things you never are supposed to say when you're on a vacation. Specially if you're traveling to a foreign country. You know, five phrases to avoid to be safe. 
>> Here is the first one: Do you speak english? You can say this phrase, but you must say it in the country's native language. It is a show of respect. They say do not ask someon in english if they speak english t would be helpful to anyone who doesn't behave, as if all citizens of the worlds should speak english. 
>> Learn the one phrase in the country. 
>> A shame, when you try, you snow. 
>> Right. 
>> And they're more willing to help you. 
>> Then you feel like an idiot. I remember in panama, a girlfriend of mine got married, so I was trying to speak in spanish, and they were speak to go me in english, like please. 
>> But I tried. 
>> Yes. 
Next one: Do you have change for a 20? Don't ask anyone this question unless they are standing in front of a cash register. If you are traveling, having small bills handy should be a standard, to tip, you know, and all of those things. So don't be seeing people for change. 
>> Here is another one here. I'm lost! Can you help me? I'm staying at a particular hotel. 
>> Oh, no. 
>> Didn't think about that. They say never tell a stranger where you are staying. Between international kidnapping is a real g, instead, experts are saying, just simply ask for directions, you know, don't ask for a specific hotel, just say where you are trying to go, or even if you say you are meeting a friend there, not that you are staying there. Okay? 

[00:49:33]


>> How do I get to the marriott. Don't say that you are staying there. 
>> Right. 
>> How about this one? I don't want to go there. There are no reviews about it. Kind every insulting. 
>> Yes. 
>> We appreciate the power and practicality of, you know, user generated reviews like this books and stuff like that, but they have their limits. New establishments, locals only, tiny and b, a he is less traveled hide aid ways. 
>> And you have some of the best foods, the most yummy food, you ask some of the locals, where do you guys go, we went to the dom inch tan republic, we asked the workers, there where do you guys go to get blah blah blah. 
>> Good idea. 
>> For all the yummy stuff. 
>> And it flatters them because their opinion matters you. 
>> Some people get irritated going through the airport security screen. 
>> And we we know this by now, shouldn't we? 
>> It is not like I have a bomb on me. Don't say that. Jokes, they don't like jokes. 
>> No. 
>> Don't be the comedian. I think sometimes people are uncomfortable, they try to be funny, and you look around and you try -- people do this to me, where they're annoyed, and they always look at me and want me to be haha with them. I'm like no, don't. You know what I mean? 
>> People get arrested for making those compliment. 
>> That's right. 
>> Don't try to be rude and look at me. You want people to join in you yoyou know, I can't believe you are standing in this line, . 
>> Haha. 
>> Poor thing. 
>> Be nice, be nice. 
>> Well, when they're patting you down, people always go, hey, normally you need a cocktail, whatever. 
>> No, no. What's the phrase people use? 
>> I need a cigarette now. 
>> Oh, yes. 
>> Shouldn't you buy me a drink first? 
>> Oh, that's the other one, yes. 
>> Well, speaking of traveling, a dog helps a cat get home safely. This is sweet. This little chihuahua decides to give its cat friends a lift. Look at that. Whether the cat wanted or not, he was going to help out n is in russia. The cat, about the same size as a sack of potatoes, finally the cat apps to have had enough.

=======================================================

>>> So, everybody ihis roomy wish you a big ring on that finger in the near future and then hail to the eagles, baby, all right, thank you. 
>>> Harry read to andy reid, yesterday, saying good bye to the eagles, of course, now time to turn the page. Garry cobb a former eagle himself is here to talk about what is next. Andy, already has a job interview. 
>>> Are you getting ready? The mummers are just hours away, sure, andy, hours away from strutting on broad street, we will get you ready for big mummers parade in just a second. As I walked into the station today this morning I saw this. 
>> I saw this on fourth and market street. 
>> It says pop my cork. 
>> Is that what it says. 
>> My goodness. 
>> There is a little tag. 
>> Somebody had a good time. 
>> Yeah, somebody had a good time and then somebody stepped it. 
>> That is how you had a fun new years eve. 
>> It was so crowded at 4:00 o'clock in the morning in olde city. You would have thought it was friday night. 
>> Yeah. 
>> It was the the most, I have worked a lot of new years day in the past 15 years and it was most crowded I have ever seen. 
>> Did you find that on the street too. 
>> I actually did, across the street. 
>> Put it on your head. 
>> But it still looks good. 
>> Yes. 
>> That person didn't have as good as a time. 
>> If that person had lice. 
>> There is some movement in there, yeah. 
>> All right, sue. 
>> Let's get to it. Maybe you have to go out or maybe you wanting to out today you will encounter a seven on a scale of one to ten. It will be looking good. Even with the cloud cover, look at bus stop buddy, he is so cute, he is mummer buddy to day because it is, new years day. That is our philadelphia tradition, it hours and hours of a row. Temperatures in the 30's to start the day and it won't rise because of the cloud cover bu will have have official sunrise at 7:23, this morning. 41 degrees our high temperature. Told you I was than the going to get that much milder. Breezy and cold with ten to 15 miles an hour winds and then tonight, it is much colder, after a frontal system comes through, we've got mostly cloudy skies and a low of 27 degrees. That is your winter weather authority fox cast for first of january, two minutes after 7:00 o'clock and unfortunately kacie, down side of new years eve, accidents. 

[00:02:31]


>> That is right, sue, that is right. Early morning accidents, don't drive, if you are going out we beg you not to drive but if you are heading out right now your roads are looking good and clear except southbound side of 202 that is closed at shoot hundred closed from boot road to paoli pike there was a fatal accident there. Crew the are still on the scene get ago this cleaned up. It has been that way for over an hour. Take phoenixville pike to get over that, southbound side, next up hatfield swab road at west or villa road is there an accident there and as far as the parade today you know that marches up north broad street, and then to jfk boulevard. Make sure if you are driving you steer clear of thatarea, guys. 
>>> The senate overwhelmingly approves a agreement to keep the country from going other the so call fiscal cliff. Now house of representatives a tougher task will to have do the same. 
>> Takes more people to agree here. We have to go to steve keeley upstairs in the news room bringing us up to date on the situation. It still sound like our paychecks will, will be affect, all of us. 
>> Reporter: They will, because payroll tax cut was allowed to expire, so no one is talking about that, on capitol hill because they are almost ashamed of it, both parties, even the the president, they want that had money to help pay down the debt, so we're all have more money taken out for social security. That was that 2 percent payroll tax deduction that is they passed two years ago, to help revive the economy. I guess they think the economy is all peachy and we don't need that 2 percent into their pockets but in the government pockets. So is there the payroll tax hike, that we are going to get now, when they are saying we're going to stop a tax hike, from anybody they didn't really. That hat you found, I think that was not by any revellers, I think it was being worn by republican congressman who threw it down in discussed when he saw what was passed by congress. All this deal does is delay most of the $110 billion in spending cuts that were going to happen for just two months. They are still on the table, still hanging on the cliff that will to have get exchange for either more tax hikes or cuts to things like social security and medicare. Imagine the huge fight coming up at the end of febru now. All senate passed was delay the cliff and climb to the higher steeper cliff that the country will be hanging off of again at the end of february and early march. It will be even worse then because, at the same time, that is when we will have another one of those fights over whether or not to raise the country's borrowing limit, its debt ceiling so we can pay our bills and not default. It will be a double whamy of worry on the way. 

[00:05:14]


>> Our most important part was to protect middle class families. This legislation does. That middle class families wake up, today, to the assurance that their taxes won't go up, $2,200 each. They will have the certainty to plan how thwill pay for groceries, rent, car payment, all during next year. 
>> Reporter: If this bill passes, as is in the house of representatives, taxes will in the go up for 98 percent of all americans. Just the wealthiest 2 percent, those who make $400,000 a and up. 
>> I feel very, very good about how this vote is going to go but having been in the senate as long as I have, there is two things you had shouldn't do, you shouldn't predict how senate will vote before they vote. You won't make a lot of money. Number two you surely shouldn't predict how the house will vote. I feel very good. I think we will get a very good vote tonight but happy new year, and I will see you all maybe tomorrow. 
>> Reporter: The house could vote as early as today but may change it and send it back to the senate first or even vote against it still. So the worry is not completely er yet to start this new year. 
>> I'm disappointed that we weren't able to make the grand bargain as we have tried to do for so long but we tried. If we do nothing the threat of a recession is very real and passing this agreement does not mean negotiations halt, far from it. We can all agree. I thank everybody for their patient is today abe they have had a lot of patients. 
>> Reporter: We have harry read and andy reid in the news, all we he need is tara reid stumbling out of the club somewhere drunk from the new years eve part and that will make the hat trick. 2 million people if there is any good news will get unemployment checks long fur this passes giving them a lot of money and really a life line to live on as they start with a new job search. One year extension of long term unemployment checks in the package, federal government now will cover unemployment after their state checks run out. Not if in it as I said is little talk about the thing that does raise everybody's taxes, 2 percent cut allowed to expire. That means a 2 percent tax cut. 2 percent out passed two years ago. Not passed this time. That is still need ago lot of reviving, this economy apparently not enough to keep the payroll tax cut. The great senators, also did the smart move, and they passed up their $900 pay hike they were going to get march 27th. Their salary will remain at $174,000. So think of that, as you struggle with your salary this year. So we will have a new higher cliff to combat in congress coming up in the end of february. This is no where near over. You'll see headlines in the paper, senate passes, deal, cliff avoided but we thought we would give you real news behind the h head line. It doesn't sound so optimistic. 

[00:08:10]


>> We just climb to the bigger cliff. Democrats are upset because they want that had 200,000, now it is up to 400,000. 
>> I guess that is compromise. 
>> But did he that press conference and I feel like it was a little early for the celebrating. 
>> Reporter: Way too early because, you know what, if i had to bet would I say congress will not pass this, the house of representatives. 
>> Don't say that. 
>> I knew we would go past the deadline. I told chris wallace that the friday after thanksgiving. I knew they were not going to get the deal done before the holidays. All I know is this the country is stronger then what washington is. So whatever they do, whatever bad they do we do enough good in the real world to combat them and I know in the long run we will be okay but I have no faith in is what going on. 
>> Start day one of the new year, steve. 
>> A lot have of republicans in that house. 
>> Thanks, steve. 
>>> We will keep an eye it all day long. 
>>> Big news stories happening from the beginning to the end of 2012 this past year had a lot of potential but it wasn't without tragedy both at home and abroad.

>> They are in grid lock on both sides.

>> I love you too. 
>> Here's sue. 
>> Well, if you love new years day, you probably will like this weather. It is kind of ofoudy though. There is a storm system to the south. We have been talking about this all morning. Mostly it will stay to the south but it is trying to bring in some rain into southern delaware, and maybe even into the jersey shore as we see, these little areas of green, most of it is precipitation that is staying up in the clouds and not making it to the ground but if you see a little sprinkle down at the delaware beaches maybe around cape may, new jersey don't be surprised. We could see a flurry or two up towards maybe in the state capitol if that is where you are heading today but not the a big deal, most of that will stay to the south. Let's talk temperature, as we see, cloudy skies, out there. 38 degrees in philadelphia 40 wilmington. Thirty mount pocono 467893 cape may. These are milder temperatures then yesterday. Wind chills in the 30's instead of the 20's. It is still cold. If you are out all day watching the parade you will need to layer it up. Only 5 miles an hour winds right now, not too bad and 41 degrees will be the high temperature today. Mostly cloudy skies. The sun will peak out every now and again, that is probably going to be it. Breezes will be with us for the the rest of the day as well. And then, with the cold front coming through that is where that system is, 36 degrees is all you will get with the high temperature wednesday. You kids will have to bundle up going back to school tomorrow. Nobody wants to hear that, back to school tomorrow. Anyway, let us look at the rest of the seven day forecast and it is pretty remarkable for the first week of 2013. No storm system, at all, in our outlook, just a lot of cloud cover today, sunshine tomorrow but really cold and staying cold, highs in the mid 30's through friday, upper 30's on saturday and sunday, still just sunshine and a dry day on monday, with 42 degreesment that is your winter weather authority, seven day forecast, kacie? 

[01:16:24]


>> All right, sue. We have a water main break and it will be in white marsh, closing butler pike between cars lane and ridge pike, be on the look out for that one. I'll let you know when it is backup and running. We are going out to the southbound side of route 202 at route 100. The thinks closed from boot road to paoli pike. Phoenixville pike will get you around that. That was that fatal accident from earlier this morning and crews are still out there on the scene. Next up north bound side of the roosevelt boulevard at ninth street, lanes are block in the inner lanes. You can see it throughout the the trees. There was an accident there. Just use caution as you approach that scene. One more accident to get to you the southbound side of route 42 at claimens bridge road. Expect a delay if you are h heading southbound, in delays on new years day, not allowed. 
>> Not at all. 
>> Eight hours and 17 minutes in the new year and we have found one of the weirdest stories of the year. We have to tack hell this thing. 
>> There thinks web site called potential prostitutes.Com how do you claim this site and get domain, I don't know but potential prostitutes.Com. Here's how it works. You can submit any woman's picture her phone number and location and then it will label her as a potential prostitute. It will post the information, without the person's consent and if you want it to be removed, it will cost you, almost a hundred bucks. 
>> Yes. 
>> This cannot be legal. 
>> It doesn't even sound legal. 
>> Let's say, no, here's amy feldman, high. 
>> Hi, how are you. 
>> The fact that anybody would do this and getaway with it for long, I don't understand. 
>> Did you think there was an end to the stupidity of things that could be posted on the internet, because if so, you would be wrong. Here is another example of the way that people misuse web sites, including this one. 
>> Well, maybe the name of it is potential prostitute, could than the anybody on earth could be a potential. There are in general, two parties that you could see if you should find yourself labeled a potential prostitute. The first is, the person who posted your name and phone number, for one thing, this is clearly a case of defamation, right? It is a false statement of fact, made about a person, that hurts her reputation or ability to earn a living, and, in fact, calling somebody a loose woman or a prostitutf is one of the and, and, picture there. And, you can sue and defamation. Well, there are laws that protect web sites, from being sued for contests that is posted by other people, by third parties but this may be an exception to that. There is a case, very similar to this, where an attorney has actually sued five different web sites, in the because it was posting picture of people who were potential prostitute but just for posting mug shots. Now a lot of people have have looked at those mug shots and they have said, you know, there are a lot of them and thing about mug shots is those are actually taken by police and those mug shots are a matter of public record. 

[01:19:37]


>> Sure. 
>> There is nothing wrong necessarily with posting a mug shot, especially of celebrity and so on, except that the web sites that were sued were charging a fee to have the person's face removed from that. And then that is a -- is there an issue here which is you have a right to publicity. Nobody else gets to make money off of you without your consent and we have that issue clearly in in web site. 
>> Is this a u.S. Company. 
>> This is not a u.S. Company. Thinks based off shore. Of course, it is hard to get to it would be hard to sushi them but people who postthese are generally right here and they know you very well and dislike you for some reason. Those people are not hard to get to. 
>> I noticed my picture was on this web site, potential prostitute, and -- 
>> did you put it there. 
>> Yes. 
>> There is always that potential. 
>> There is a potential. 
>> Shall. 
>> Who knows is what around the the corner you might get in trouble. 
>> Sure. 
>> Anyway, so we will link that to our web site. 
>> Yes, my fox philly.Com. 
>> Amy good to see you. 
>> Hold on a second. 
>> Happy new year. 
>> Happy new year. 
>> Good to see you.

[01:24:02]


>>> You know, people hit hard by hurricane sandy, well, they still have to have new years eve too. 
>> Sure. 
>> Look at this this year, because is there still some curfews in place. Sea side heights celebrated ringing in the new year around 4:00 o'clock in the afternoon. Until the curfew kick in. Revellers say holiday is a welcome distraction for people h lost just about everything with the storm. 
>>> With the new year, you know, comes a host of new laws and changes, in different parts of the country. The let's start in the state of maryland, gay couples are now able to tie the knot legally. Nine states and district of columbia legalized same sex marriage across the country. How about this, workers in california and state of illinois can now say, no, to bosses demanding access to their social media account, can I look at your facebook account? No, you can say that. Ten states across the country are raising the minimum wage today. But the the most peculiar is this is why we're showing you wild bores in the state of kentucky. That is where it is now, illegal for residents to the state of the kentucky to release wild hogs back into the wild. So, parentally a lot of people have have wild hogs on their property. 
>> We learn from kacie earlier this morning that they do a lot of damage. They are scratching, and scratching their cars, and and climbing in. 
>> We discovered she and her father and i, we watch that show about wild hog, hogs, and the guy, the family that capture them. 
>> She was telling me that is her favorite show. 
>> Well, that is horrifying, yeah. It is kind of an interesting family, big old dad and then there is a couple of sexy daughters on horses. 
>> Her dad and she's the sexy daughter that is why they watch it together. 
>> I wonder if she hunts wild petition. 
>> She does. 
>> Yeah. 

[01:26:02]


>> It is a weird tradition for guys h love crashing their cars. 
>> Of course. 
>> They crash them over and over and over. Big little boys. 
>> Do you want to show them. 
>> Fearless. Yeah. Drivers in wrecked cars racing over ramps trying to fly over roads of cars. And crashing and crashing and crashing.

>> What does he do. 
>> He is an auto mechanic. 
>> It looks so dangerous it is. 
>> It is not even funny, but crazy. 
>> It does not look like fun. 
>> No. 
>> Then they march up the street and they should do that instead. 
>> What a waste of time. 
>> All right. 
>> Let's look at video of the rescue helicopter as he crashes off the coast of rio di janeiro, thinks the beach. 
>> Watch this. 
>> What were they trying to do here. 
>> Fire fighting chopper, on its way to rescue some swimmers. Basically their coastguard. And then that went down. Police say four people on board sustained minor injuries, but official says an unspecified mechanical failure, no kidding, caused the crash.

>> Let's say you have a passion, you want to do something and committed to doing it but you still to have keep your full-time job. You have a dream of starting your own business but you just can't start this business. You have to work. 
>> You are strategic. You can do your full-time gig but work towards your passion. I asked people do you want your passion or to you want a paycheck. Do you want job or joy. Once you have your joy, for me, I believe money will follow you. Interest is talking about it. Interest is thinking bit. Interest is tweeting bit. Commitment is facing uncertainty. 

[01:33:17]


>> Easier to go after it. 
>> Strategically embracing uncertainty. 
>> Think about all of the people, that is your life, i will do this and they never get to it. 
>> Always talk bit. 
>> How do you, I mean, you have waited long enough, jump off. 
>> Shifting your mind set. It is wanting it, grabbing it, it is expecting it to come to fruition. We hope. I have been hoping eagles would turn this thing around. I believed they would. So it is hoping it, it is in the hoping it is coming to fruition, it is expecting it and it is going for and that ties into number three which is it is already to hurry. Focusing on getting your tan, tan stand for take action now. So focusing on your tan and getting off your butt. The butt is your argument for your limitations when you argue for your limitations you get to keep them. We are always saying I will do this but. I want to start my own company, but. I wanting to back to school, but. We need to get off our butts and get ready to go. 
>> So let's talk about ways to actually do thatment you hear that talk. We all know not to eat the 12 doughnuts but it is just so hard. So first you say, use tangible reminders to start doing that. What do you mean by that. 
>> Number one, I have two bracelets on. One that says my best is yet to come. It is the constant reminder that I have in the done my best work yet. 
>> Okay. 
>> Hold your wrist up there. You have a watch on but you HAVE TWO BRACELETq, AND YOU Just every time lou down is there a reminder. 
>> Yes. 
>> Second one is no excuse club. 
>> Yes. 
>> Reminder that if I wanted to have it happy cannot make excuses if it has been off the book but these two month excuse bracelet, my best is why it to come that reminds me I have not done my best work yet. People say time-to-time, was their best presentation. I haven't done it yet. I have work to do. 
>> I say it every day, I have not done the best show yet. 
>> Really, you have had some great shows. 
>> There has got to be something better in there. 
>> Another tip in the book, think more titans more titanic. 

[01:35:20]


>> What do you mean. 
>> Think about those two people, you have titans, they are there to lift you up, and to propel you. Titanics, they are there to sink you. We spend more time with our titanics. 
>> Are you talking about our acquaintances, friends. 
>> There are some people, mike that when you see their phone number come up and you are like ahh, no, titanic, titanic. 
>> Don't answer. 
>> So spend time, hold up with your titans. Would I like you to help me here and here. I want to you call me on that there. 
>> People you surround yourself with. 
>> Bring them in. 
>> See that number just don't answer it.

Greg has to give his parents the phone at 7:30 on a school night but some are just plane life lessons hoffman wanted to share like listening to the birds, wonder without googling.

att shows of all time. I'm trying to think if tre was anybody not Jewish. From its beginnings, Broadway musical theater has always been fertile ground for a wide variety of Jewish-American artists. Why were so many of them Jewish? The answers are in the songs, the shows, 
and "Broadway Musicals: A Jewish Legacy." "Great Performances" is brought to you by... Major funding for this program was provided by... Philadelphia's National Museum of American Jewish History, celebrating culture and community, imagination and ideas. Major funding for "Great Performances" is provided by the National Endowment for the Arts. Art works. And by contributions to your PBS station from viewers like you. provided family, 
proud supporters of "Broadway Musicals: A Jewish Legacy." Once upon a time, King Arthur wanted to take his knights on a quest to do a musical on Broadway, but this was a very, very bad idea. And I'm going to tell you why. ?????? In any great adventure, if you don't want to lose ?????? ?????? Victory depends upon the people that you choose ?????? ?????? So listen, Arthur darling, closely to this news ?????? ?????? You won't succeed on Broadway if you don't have any Jews ?????? ?????? You may have the finest sets ?????? ?????? Fill the stage with penthouse pets ?????? ?????? You may have the loveliest costumes and best shoes ?????? ?????? You may dance and you may sing ?????? ?????? But I'm sorry, Arthur King ?????? ?????? You'll hear no cheers, just lots and lots of boos ?????? ?????? You may have butch men by the score ?????? ?????? Whom the audience adore ?????? ?????? You may even have some animals from zoos ?????? ?????? Though you've Poles and Krauts instead ?????? ?????? You may have unleavened bread ?????? ?????? But I tell you, you are dead if you don't have any Jews ?????? It's not funny unless it's true. And people only laugh because they think, "It's true." Rodgers and Hammerstein. You can name off all the Broadway composers. Jerry Herman. Irving Berlin. Everybody on Broadway except Cole Porter. Sheldon Harnick and Jerry Bock. George Gershwin, Steve Sondheim. I'm trying to think if there was anybody not Jewish. ?????? Ooooo... ?????? ?????? oy! ?????? My husband, Adolph Green, and his wonderful partner, Betty Comden. And, of course, Lenny Bernstein. Why were they -- so many of them Jewish? ?????? There simply must be, Arthur, trust me ?????? ?????? Simply must be Jews ?????? Is it that they were misfits and then they all found themselves in musical theater because it was a place where, with their unusual brains, they could all collaborate and co-exist in an environment that allowed for that flexibility? Maybe that was it. Maybe one day we'll say, "Oh, they all had A.D.D. and that's why ty all ended up in musical theater. It wasn't about the Jewishness at all." 

[00:04:03]


[ Orchestra playing "There's No Business Like Show Business" ] 
JOEL GREY: For generations of Jewish songwriters, Broadway has been a place for transformation. On Broadway, the idea of outsiders overcoming obstacles could be dramatized in a uniquely American art form. On Broadway, melodies from Jewish prayers inspired new songs that would be embraced by millions. Broadway offered Jewish songwriters a chance to make it in Arica, and in return, they fashioned an America of their own in songs and shows that are applauded around the world. "Porgy and Bess" and "Show Boat" and "Oklahoma!" These are ideas that are fictions. What do we make America into? How do we take what we know and make it into America? The Broadway musical is a sort of tipping point experience where a handful of composers and lyricists created a way for all of us to experience the ideas that have become part of what we call the American dream. 
[ Orchestra plays "The Shepherd's Dream" 
GREY: Before the Broadway musical established its home near Times Square early in the 20th century, there was a lively theater that thrived downtown on the Lower East Side, where Yiddishkeit 

[00:06:10]


-- meaning "all things Jewish" -- predominated. There, Russian immigrants like Boris Thomashefsky and his wife, Bessie, pioneered a kind of musical theater which spoke to the multitude of greenhorns fresh off the boat -- the Yiddish theater. 
MAN: There is a huge connection between Broadway and the American Yiddish theater. People don't get that anymore -- about how powerful Yiddishkeit was in the foundation of Broadway, and that the direction of Yiddishkeit was twofold. It was to amuse, but it was also to inruct, and that the theater could be used, ultimately, as a medium for showing people on stage how certain situations in life might play out. And hopefully offering them the opportunity to learn from the examples that they saw onstage. I was a prot??g?? of the great Boris Thomashefsky! 
[ Crowd gasps ] Yes, Yes. He taught me everything I know. I'll never forget, he turned to me on his deathbed and said, "Maxella, ala menchen al mashen, haden tukka gatsen gashen pishen pipa casen!" What does that mean? Who knows? I don't speak Yiddish. Strangely enough, neither did he. Very often in listening to an early Broadway song, you can think that you're hearing a Jewish song. So there's not all that much difference between a song like "Greena Cuisina"... and the opening of "Swanee." ?????? I've been away from you a long time ?????? ?????? I never thought I'd miss you so ?????? ?????? Somehow I feel, ur love is real ?????? ?????? Near you I wanna be ?????? 

[00:08:36]


GREY: In 1919, composer George Gershwin, working with lyricist Irving Caesar, wrote "Swanee," the most popular song of Gershwin's career. ?????? Swanee, you're calling me ?????? ?????? Swanee ?????? ?????? How I love ya, how I love ya ?????? ?????? My dear old Swanee ?????? 
GREY: The song relied on a now shameful convention from the 19th century in which a black-faced minstrel singer longed for a mythic southland. ?????? Waiting for me, praying for me ?????? ?????? Down by the Swanee ?????? 
GREY: By the time "Swanee" was a hit, the 20-year-old Gershwin had been working in the music industry for five years. Having dropped out of high school, at one point, Gershwin tried to write songs for the Yiddish theater but was rejected as "too American." The Gershwin family, like so many immigrant families, figured, "Give your kid music lessons because that's one more step up the rung of ladder of assimilation and success. Give your kids every possible chance." So they buy a piano for George's brother Ira and it's up on a crane, put through their window of their apartment, and suddenly George goes over and starts playing. Well, he's been practicing on a player piano. 
[ Piano playing "Swanee" ] So he gets music lessons and goes on to become a piano player on Tin Pan Alley, then a Broadway composer. Ira turns from writing clever light verse to becoming a lyricist. And Ira's way of keeping up with this very revolutionary musical brother of his is to build lyrics around American slang. 
MAN: Ira loved to use colloquial expressions in his writing. The best example of that, that I know, is one weekend, probably in about 1936, Ira and his wife Leonore came to spend the weekend with my parents. My father manufactured tomato products. And during the course of that weekend, myell me, ho father, "Tell me, how come you call them tomatoes and your sister calls them tomahtoes?" And my father said to Ira, "Well, if I called them tomahtoes, the farmers that I buy them from would not know what I was talking about." And everybody forgot about it. ?????? You like potato and I like ?????? ?????? Potahto? ?????? ?????? You like tomato and I like ?????? ?????? Tomahto ?????? ?????? Potato ?????? ?????? Potahto ?????? ?????? Tomato ?????? ?????? Tomahto ?????? ?????? Let's call the whole thing off ?????? ?????? But oh ?????? ?????? If we call the whole thing off ?????? ?????? Then we must part ?????? ?????? And oh ?????? ?????? If we ever part, then that might break my heart ?????? ?????? So if you like pajamas and I like pajammas ?????? ?????? I'll wear pajamas and give up pajammas ?????? ?????? For we know we need each other so ?????? ?????? We better call the calling off off ?????? 

[00:11:56]


GREY: The same year that George and Ira began writing shows together for Broadway, George was commissioned to write a piece for an evening of experimental music. The result was "Rhapsody in Blue." 
MAN: How does Gershwin start the "Rhapsody in Blue" but with a Klezmer clarinet. You can hear... ?????? Doyo-doyo-dah ?????? We could be talking about Romania here. You know, I mean it's pure Yiddishkeit, you know. But he cloaks it within, you know, classical forms that are contemporary, modern, modern classical music influenced with jazz. So his music really is a melting pot. It becomes a reflection of the American experience. 
FURIA: George Gershwin was always experimenting, trying to bring jazz and blues and ragtime 
-- basically black music -- into mainstream Broadway musicals. 
MAN: There's a big affinity between the Jewish wail that you hear in the temple and the black spiritual or the blues. I think a lot of it has to do with the minor key. I think it also has something to do with bent notes and altered chords. The blues scale has a kind of built-in minor-ness to it. That blue note is... Well, I guess it's a blue note, though it existed before the blues, is, you know, the... that... Doesn't that kind of sound Jewish to you? Yeah. It's the kind of little flat thing as opposed to, if I'm in the key of C, you know. Sounds sort of Episcopalian. I mean the Jewish thing, it's... it's all minor. Because, you know, Jews and their misery. The blacks, amazingly, always still had a little faith and hope. So they're at odds. Not the Jews. 

[00:14:38]


[ Excited murmuring ] 
LEHMAN: Ira collaborated with George on one of the songs for "Porgy and Bess." It is a song that debunks the Bible. ?????? It ain't necessarily so ?????? It ain't necessarily so. The things you're liable to read in the Bible, it ain't necessarily so. ?????? The things that you're liable to read in the Bible ?????? ?????? It ain't necessarily so ?????? That line is actually lifted from the liturgy because when you're called up to the Torah in the temple on Saturday, you have to make a blessing, and you say... 
[ Singing in Hebrew ] which is the same thing as... ?????? It ain't necessarily so ?????? So to borrow a prayer over the Bible for a song that debunks the Bible seems to me to be the very definition of hutzpah, cheekiness. ?????? Wadoo, zim bam boddle-oo ?????? ?????? Hoodle ah da wa da ?????? 
LEHMAN: They were very clever. Has lines like, about Jonah, "He made his home in that fish's ab-do-men." ?????? Oh, Jonah, he lived in the whale ?????? ?????? Oh, Jonah, he lived in the whale ?????? ?????? For he made his home in that fish's ab-do-men ?????? 
MAN: Tunes wrien by Jews for non-Jewish audiences. The greatest ones have all been re-versioned by the greatest African-American jazz artists. 
[ Jazz plays ] Some of the most important examples of jazz improvisation come from Gershwin tunes. That back and forth, that may not always be a cordial one, it might be a contentious one, but I just love that there's a dialogue going on. I like that there's a battle. I like that there's a sense of, "Oh, you wrote this? I'm gonna rewrite it. You were inspired by this thing I did, now I'm going to take your inspiration and I'm going to redo it and take it one step higher." That sense of a kind of friendly competition runs throughout American pop music. 

[00:17:08]


FURIA: All of these songs that were created, first on Broadway and later in Hollywood, have really become a part of our collective culture. And it's amazing that this great body of American song was produced by a handful of people, most of them Jewish. Starting with people like Jerome Kern, Irving Berlin and Harold Arlen, George and Ira Gershwin, Richard Rodgers and Lorenz Hart, all Jewish songwriters. 
GUETTEL: I think Broadway was like a little Jewish club. And it's still a little Jewish club. It's a wonderful club to be in. My father couldn't wait to go to work. He didn't want to do anything else but work. Daddy met Larry Hart through friends, and in a very short time, they understood the same things that they wanted out of the musical theater, and nobody had done it yet, and they got along wonderfully. Gentlemen, you're about to be interviewed. Wait'll I fix my tie. Don't you like being interviewed? Well, I don't mind. As long as you don't ask us which we write first, the words or the music. I'm not going to ask you that. 
GREY: Richard Rodgers and Lorenz Hart lived uptown. They came from successful families and both attended Columbia University, but getting their songs to Broadway wasn't easy, as they re-enacted a few years later for the movie cameras. It's all your fault. My fault? All you did was talk about your lyrics. Why didn't you let me play the music for them? I'm sick of this racket. Now you'll have to go into the real estate business with your father. Come on. 
GREY: Just as Rodgers was about to give up music and go into the babies' underwear business, the team struck gold with a song that turned their hometown into an "isle of joy." Manhattan! We'll have Manhattan, the Bronx, and Staten 

[00:19:18]


-- 
MAN: ?????? Island too ?????? ?????? It's lovely going through the zoo ?????? ?????? It's very fancy on old Delancey Street, they say ?????? The song "Manhattan" starts with these Lower East Side streets. It starts with Delancey Street and Mott Street but it expands exponentially. It goes to Centralark. It goes to Coney Island. It goes to the theater district. Their dreams were taking over all of Manhattan, and, of course, that's exactly what they did in their song. 
GREY: While Rodgers and Hart rhapsodized about the Lower East Side in song, this predominantly Jewish neighborhood was one of the most congested places on earth, frighteningly crowded, noisy and filthy. Out of this rough and tumble world would emerge America's greatest songwriter. 
FURIA: In 1893, Irving Berlin, then five years old, gets off the boat at Ellis Island in New York. His earliest memory as a child growing up in Russia was of a pogrom, a vigilante attack on his Jewish village. And he remembers hiding in a ditch with his brothers and sisters and parents, watching Russian Cossacks burn down their village. Then he comes to America, gets off the boat, looks around him, sees all these Americans, and he says, "We stood there in our Jew clothes." He realized how different he was from everybody else. 
GREY: His father was a cantor who taught him how to sing the prayers in synagogue, but Berlin was drawn to all of the different kinds of music he heard on the streets. The ethnic songs were very popular at that point. So there was "Sadie Salome, Go Home!" There was the "Yiddishe Nightingale," a beautiful song. "The Yiddishe Professor." "Jake, Jake, the Yiddisha Ball Player." There was also, "Oh, How That German Can Love." There was "Sweet Italian Love." And so forth. They were humorous love songs. 

[00:21:29]


[ Orchestra plays ] 
GREY: Berlin was soon writing songs for Broadway revues like the Ziegfeld Follies and for shows built around talents such as the Marx Brothers. Ah, how do you do? Are you boys giving me the run around here? Come over here. ?????? And I'll be there with you ?????? ?????? When my dreams ?????? ?????? Come true ?????? Berlin wanted to write popular songs for a multi-ethnic America. And as time went on, the business of pop song writing, Berlin became the kind of poster boy for the immigrant Jewish sensibility transformed into the mainstream American. 
GREY: For many, becoming American meant changing your name. Israel Baline became Irving Berlin. Jacob Gershowitz, George Gershwin. Isidore Hochberg morphed into Yip Harburg, who wrote the lyrics to "The Wizard of Oz," with composer Hyman Arluck, better known as Harold Arlen. 
KUN: To be considered American, you've got to sound a certain way, you've got to look a certain way, and if your last name has too many syllables and makes people think of herring, you might not get the job. ?????? Someone's head resting on my knee ?????? ?????? Warm and tender as he can be ?????? ?????? Who takes good care of me ?????? ?????? Wouldn't it ?????? ?????? Be loverly ?????? ?????? Loverly ?????? ?????? Loverly ?????? 

[00:23:43]


GREY: Jewish songwriters almost never told Jewish stories. Instead, the main character might be a downtrodden flower girl with a Cockney accent in Alan Jay Lerner and Frederick Loewe's "My Fair Lady," or a biracial singer passing as white in Oscar Hammerstein and Jerome Kern's "Show Boat." ?????? Fish gotta swim ?????? ?????? Birds gotta fly ?????? ?????? I gotta love one man ?????? ?????? 'Til I die ?????? ?????? Can't help ?????? ?????? Lovin' that man ?????? ?????? Of mine ?????? 
KUN: One of the ways that Jewish songwriters on Broadway wrote about the experience of being Jewish is by writing about other outsiders. I'm not going to tell you the story of Jews in America, but I am going to tell you the story of an African-American on a riverboat. I'm going to use somebody else's story to tell you mine. The more the Jews are not writing about Jews, I think you could argue is when they're actually writing the most about Jews. 
GREY: The lyricist of "Show Boat," Oscar Hammerstein II, was part of a Broadway dynasty. He was raised Protestant but his grandfather and namesake was a German-born Jewish impresario, whose theaters helped to define Times Square at the turn of the century. As a teenager, Oscar went to summer camp and not only played sports but learned to put on shows. For many of Broadway's songwriters, summer camps offered invaluable experiences. At Camp Paradox, Larry Hart was known as "Shakespeare," because his trunk was crammed with books instead of clothing. Richard Rodgers went to the same camp, where he wrote songs when he wasn't teaching kids how to swim. 

[00:26:07]


HERMAN: My parents owned a summer children's camp, ly becamethe dram and I eventually became the drama counselor and put on shows there. I was learning about those simple songs that became "The Best of Times," that became "Mame" and "Hello, Dolly," without knowing it. 
MAN: The camp that I went to let me put on the shows. I was 13 or 14 years old, but I thought that's the best present anybody ever gave me. It probably changed my life. 
MAN: I was told when I went to Camp Wigwam that Steve Sondheim had gone there, but he said, "I never went to Wigwam, I went to Camp Androscoggin." 
GREY: Summer camps were not just initial training grounds for songwriters. Sometimes lifelong partnerships were formed there. 
WOMAN: My father was music directing at this camp and it was really his lucky day when this weird, schlubby guy, Adolph Green, arrived to play the Pirate King in "Pirates of Penzance." And Lenny had heard about Adolph through Adolph's friends, how Adolph knew everything there was to know about classical music. On their first meeting, when my father found out that Adolph purportedly knew everything, he said, "Oh, yeah, come over here," and they sat down at the piano and my father said, "What's this?" And he played something and Adolph would say, "Ravel, Piano Concerto No. 2." Two seconds, okay. Played another thing. "Tchaikovsky's...number 4." Two seconds, he knew it. And my father couldn't stump him, until finally he played this one thing. "What's this?" And Adolph didn't know what it was. And Lenny jumped up, grabbed him and kissed him. He said, "I just made it up on the spot to try to really screw you." 

[00:28:12]


JAMIE: They were best friends forever more, and the thing about Adolph is that he had this kind of impish spirit. He had this liveliness and this antic quality, and then when Betty Comden became Adolph's working partner, and she was so lively and quick on the trigger and funny and sassy, the three of them had so much fun together. They really spoke to this zany part of my father. This monstrous little duet is entitled "Carried Away." ?????? Modern man ?????? ?????? What is it? ?????? ?????? Just a collection of complexes ?????? ?????? And neurotic impulses ?????? ?????? That occasionally break through ?????? You mean, sometimes you blow your top, like me? ?????? I do ?????? 
JAMIE: If they hadn't come along, maybe my father wouldn't have written musical theater, or certainly not the kind of musical theater that he wrote with Betty and Adolph that was so delightfully fun and goofy. I mean, after all, he was supposed to be a very serious maestro. ?????? Carried away ?????? ?????? Carried away, I get carried ?????? ?????? Get carried a... ?????? ?????? Way! ?????? 
GREY: In the 20th century, New York City attracted a large Jewish population. In the 1920s, nearly one in four residents was Jewish. Even so, the preponderance of Jewish songwriters on Broadway was, and is, a phenomenon. 
JAMIE: They're almost all Jewish, but the great exception that makes you wonder whether it's a rule at all is Cole Porter. What the hell is he doing in there? Porter, though he tried very hd to write a successful Broadw show, hadn't succee Three shows flopped. And he met Richard Rodgers in Venice and played him some of his songs. Rodgers knew that this was an immensely talented man. And Porter confided at one point that he thought that he had finally figured out the secret of writing hits. "Oh?" Rodgers said. "What's that?" And Porter said, "I'm going to write Jewish tunes." I asked him if that story were true and he said yes. And then I thought about it, and I thought, well, gee, you know, Cole Porter... What could be more Jewish sounding than... ?????? You'd be so nice to come home to ?????? ...especially since my father used to sing a song that went... 

[00:30:53]


[ Singing in Yiddish ] He used to sing it to me when I was a little boy. So yeah, that... I wouldn't be a bit surprised if that notion occurred to him. There's something sort of Semitic about that as well. ?????? Strange, dear, but true, dear ?????? ?????? When I'm close to you ?????? ?????? Dear ?????? ?????? The stars fill the sky ?????? ?????? So in love... ?????? 
MAN: Yip Harburg, my father, said even Cole Porter was Jewish because back in the Inquisition times, he was really Jewish and they forced him to become a Christian, see? So, since then... And then Yip would sing some of Cole Porter's songs in a Hebraic Middle Eastern chant, you know. If you listen to "My Heart Belongs to Daddy," the part in it... ?????? Da-dah-da da-dah-da ?????? that sounds a little like davining... ?????? Da-dah-da da-dah-da da-daddy-ah ?????? ...like praying in temple. ?????? So I want to warn you, laddies ?????? ?????? Though I think you're perfectly swell ?????? ?????? That my heart belongs to daddy ?????? ?????? And my daddy, he treats it so well ?????? 
GREY: In the mid-1930s, Cole Porter's shows served as a great escape for theatergoers in the midst of the Depression. ?????? My heart belongs to daddy ?????? 
GREY: Across the ocean in Germany, however, only a fortunate few Jewish families would find a way to escape from the wrath of the Third Reich. 
[ Boots tromping ] 

[00:32:54]


[ Crowd chanting "Sieg heil!" ] 
WEILL: I decided to become a citizen on the day on which I arrived here, six years ago. I remember very well the feeling I had as the shi moved down the harbor past the Statue of Liberty and the skyscrapers. All about us were exclaiming in amazement at the strange sights, but my wife and I had the sensation that we were coming home. 
GREY: Kurt Weill was Germany's leading theatrical composer, but he was also Jewish -- the son of a cantor. His work, including the popular "Threepenny Opera," had been denounced by the Third Reich for being "degenerate." January 30th, the reason I remember it is my birthday. January 30, 1933, not my... my birth date, no, but my birthday, was when Hitler became chancellor of Germany. Kurt Weill left that day, and a lot of people left that day. It was a huge exodus. Goodbye. They knew. 
GREY: Weill and his wife and muse, Lotte Lenya, eventually ended up in the United States, where "The Threepenny Opera" had already been performed on Broadway. Kurt Weill had already brought his own radical musical revolution to America before he got there. "Come Join the Army" or... His love of the ambivalence of major and minor in so many of his songs -- "Pirate Jenny." There are Jewish melodic elements in his music. But he comes to America and you can see the evolution of musical style as he writes "September Song." ?????? But it's a long long while ?????? ?????? From May to December ?????? ?????? And the days grow short ?????? ?????? When you reach September ?????? 

[00:35:51]


GREY: "September Song" from the show Knickerbocker Holiday became Kurt Weill's first popular standard in America. 
PRINCE: He was immediately recognized as a great composer. One of the great landmark shows was "Lady In The Dark." Moss Hart took his own psychoanalysis and used it as a motivation for writing that show. No one had seen anything like it. 
GREY: "Lady in the Dark" paired Weill with Ira Gershwin, working on his first Broadway show since the premature death of his brother at the age of 38. A circus dream sequence made Danny Kaye a star when he was able to recite Gershwin's witty list of Russian composers in record speed. ?????? Stravinsky, Rimsky-Korsakoff, Mussorgsky, and Gretchaninoff ?????? ?????? And Glazounoff and C??sar Cui, Kalinikoff, Rachmaninoff ?????? ?????? Stravinsky and Gretchnaninoff, Rumshinsky and Rachmaninoff ?????? ?????? I really have to stop ?????? ?????? The subject has been dwelt upon enough! ?????? ?????? Stravinsky ?????? ?????? Gretchnaninoff ?????? ?????? Rumshinsky ?????? ?????? Rachmaninoff ?????? ?????? We really ought to stop because we all have undergone enough! ?????? 
[ Applause ] 
WEILL: What the immigrants of today are bringing to this country is not more and not less than what the immigrants from earlier persecutions have brought here. All they ever could bring was the work of their hands and the work of their heads. That's what they offer to this country and what the people of this country are so ready to accept. Kurt Weill was incredibly, I'd almost say obsessed with the idea of assimilation, obsessed with the idea of being different. He tried to make it in Hollywood and they said his stuff was too Jewish. Studio execs said, "Your stuff is too Jewish." And he was perplexed by that. He said, "Irving Berlin is a Russian Jew. I'm a German Jew. That's the only difference. We're both Americans." 

[00:37:59]


[ Foghorn blows ] 
GREY: Though both Kurt Weill and Irving Berlin were Jewish-American immigrants, Berlin's uncanny ability to write songs that felt American was unparalleled. Berlin humbly claimed he just had a little "knack" for songwriting, but time and again he would create beloved anthems for his adopted country. 
FURIA: This is the guy who will so assimilate to America, he will write the most popular Christmas song, "White Christmas." And even though he's Jewish, writes the most popular Easter song, "Easter Parade." It's the Horatio Alger story told in Yiddish. He grows up and becomes the most American of all of us. ?????? God bless America ?????? ?????? Land that I love ?????? ?????? Stand beside her ?????? ?????? And guide her ?????? ?????? Through the night ?????? ?????? With the light from above ?????? That song came from the heart, and it was his thank-you to this country that had taken him in and given him the chance to become who he became. 
YESTON: Who would think that in the most American major sounding work that Berlin wrote, there would be in it what I hear very clearly as this. Well, the Jewish word would be... But it would be a real cantorial... 
[ Singing in Hebrew ] Well, let's take that... and I'll just put a fundamental bass tone under it. ?????? God bless America ?????? ?????? My home ?????? ?????? Sweet ?????? ?????? Home ?????? 

[00:40:13]


[ Applause ] 
BARRETT: But there were people who protested "God Bless America." There were ministers who got up in church and said, "What does a Jew have to do with asking God to bless America?" There was real anti-Semitism. You know, you didn't feel that in the world of the theater, because that was a world in which nobody knew who everybody was or where they came from, just what they did. 
[ Band playing "Alexander's Ragtime Band" ] 
GREY: "God Bless America" became so popular, it almost replaced the National Anthem. With the onset of World War II, Jewish songwriters joined the effort to lift the spirits of servicemen and the country at large. Berlin mounted a new show called "This is the Army," with receipts donated to an army relief fund. The lyricist Dorothy Fields, who wrote "On the Sunny Side of the Street," cheered up servicemen at the Stage Door Canteen. And Private Frank Loesser, later known for "Guys and Dolls," wrote the wartime hit "Praise the Lord and Pass the Ammunition." Servicemen on leave were given free tickets to see Oscar Hammerstein's latest show, created with his new partner, Richard Rodgers. ?????? There's a bright golden haze on the meadow ?????? ?????? There's a bright golden haze on the meadow ?????? ?????? The corn is as high as an elephant's eye ?????? ?????? And it looks like it's climbing ?????? ?????? Clear up to the sky ?????? ?????? Oh what a beautiful mornin' ?????? ?????? Oh what a beautiful day ?????? ?????? I got a beautiful feelin' ?????? ?????? Everything's going my way ?????? 

[00:42:32]


GREY: Rodgers and Hammerstein brought a new level of drama to the Broadway musical, often dealing with moral and racial issues for both the characters and the audience to confront. Hammerstein wrote both book and lyrics, bringing a kind of open-hearted humanitarianism to his work, which informed his personal life as well. 
GUETTEL: I think Oscar was a liberal, Jewish in that respect, and cared a great deal about the world. You can tell by all the lyrics that he wrote. Like "Show Boat," which was the landmark un-prejudiced musical, that he felt keenly about those things. He was one of the people who started the Pearl Buck Foundation. Those children were the product of Asian women and usually American GIs. ?????? Bali Ha'i ?????? ?????? May call you ?????? ?????? Any night, any day ?????? ?????? In your heart, you'll hear it call you ?????? ?????? "Come away, come away" ?????? 
GREY: In their Pulitzer Prize winning show "South Pacific," Rodgers and Hammerstein dramatized the experience of servicemen and women abroad and delivered an urgent musical plea for racial tolerance. It's not born in you, it happens after you're born. ?????? You've got to be taught ?????? ?????? To hate and fear ?????? ?????? You've got to be taught ?????? ?????? From year to year ?????? ?????? It's got to be drummed ?????? ?????? In your dear little ear ?????? ?????? You've got to be ?????? ?????? Carefully taught ?????? 
GUETTEL: "You've Got To Be Carefully Taught" was something that they felt strongly about. Now they didn't try to do stories just because they could get their political leanings in front of the public. But it comes up all the time because it's there all the time. It mattered to them. ?????? There's a place for us ?????? ?????? A time and place for us ?????? 

[00:45:19]


[ Singing in Spanish ] ?????? Hold my hand ?????? ?????? And I'll take you there ?????? 
GREY: As the Broadway musical matured after World War II and issues like bigotry and racism were no longer entirely off limits, director Jerome Robbins began working on a show called "East Side Story" that featured a conflict between Jews and Gentiles. 
MAN: Jerry Robbins came to Lenny Bernstein and me to do a contemporary version of "Romeo and Juliet." One or the other was to be Catholic and Jewish, I forget which, and what finally happened was I realized it was "Abie's Irish Rose" set to music. That was an enormous hit in the Dark Ages, with a Catholic girl and a Jewish boy. And so we dropped it. 
GREY: "East Side Story" was transformed years later when the creative team found a way to project ion onto a new group of immigrants. With a score by Leonard Bernstein and lyrics by a 27-year-old Stephen Sondheim, the show musicalized the conflict between white ethnics and Puerto Ricans finding their way in America. ?????? Lots of new housing with more space ?????? ?????? Lots of doors slamming in our face ?????? ?????? I'll get a terrace apartment ?????? ?????? Better get rid of your accent ?????? ?????? Life can be bright in America ?????? ?????? If you can fight in America ?????? ?????? Life is alright in America ?????? ?????? If you're all white in America ?????? 
LAURENTS: That's something that has made the show more timely today than it was then. When the word "immigrant" is said on the stage today, you can feel the whole audience freeze because of all this -- I won't characterize it -- stuff going on in Congress about immigrants. It's a nation of immigrants, which we are very busy trying to deny. 

[00:47:59]


JAMIE: My father never gave up on the idea that the world could become a better place. But he struggled with it because all these ghastly calamities kept happening in his lifetime, starting with World War II, really, being the big one, and then the bomb, and then he went through McCarthyism, which was so evil. So all the way through his life he was constantly doing whatever he could to make the world a better place. Racism, not the least of these evils, that he was trying to repair. And I really think he felt somehow that if he wrote a great enough piece of music, he could change the world. And you can really hear that struggle in "West Side Story." It's about intolerance and hatred and the misery that that sows in the world. ?????? Somehow ?????? ?????? Someday ?????? ?????? Somewhere ?????? ?????? Let me entertain you ?????? ?????? Let me see you smile ?????? ?????? Let me do a few tricks ?????? ?????? Some old and then some new tricks ?????? ?????? I'm very versatile ?????? ?????? And if you're real good ?????? ?????? I'm gonna maku feel good ?????? ?????? I've been -- something to smile ?????? 

[00:50:06]


[GLISSANDO] Forgive me, Steve! ?????? Let me entertain you ?????? ?????? And we'll have a real good time, yes, sir ?????? ?????? We'll have ?????? ?????? A real good time ?????? 
GREY: Jule Styne emigrated from London and was raised in Chicago, where he became a classical pianist as a young child. Even with all his talent, he was insecure around the kids at school. 
STYNE: I wanted to be liked, wanted applause badly. And I went out and bought 20 Irving Berlin songs over the weekend, zed them... and I memorized them... "Alexander's Ragtime Band" was one of them. And I played it with all the power I had in my hands, my Beethoven power on "Alexander's Ragtime Band." And I walked into that gymnasium on Monday afternoon. I was an instant smash! 
GREY: After working as a band leader, a vocal coach, and a top composer in Hollywood, Styne longed for the creative freedom of Broadway. His score for the landmark show "Gypsy," which starred Ethel Merman, seemed to draw on all of Styne's experiences in show business. I'd wanted Steve Sondheim to do the whole score. Merman -- actually, her agent didn't want Steve, so we needed a composer and Jerry Robbins suggested Jule. but e from the old school. He was not used to writing this integrated stuff, so I would just give him lyrics to set for the most part. I would write out the rhythms and Ethel Merman belted songs. What can I say? ?????? That's okay for some people ?????? ?????? Who don't know they're alive ?????? ?????? Some people can thrive and bloom ?????? 

[00:52:09]


STYNE: Every star has a trademark and you better deliver that trademark somewhere for that audience. When I gave Steve the tune to... ?????? Some people ba-da-da-da ?????? But the release goes... ?????? But I... ?????? ?????? But I... ?????? 
STYNE: At that moment, the audience says, "Oh, there's Merman." ?????? When I think of all the sights that I gotta see yet ?????? ?????? All the places I gotta play ?????? 
STYNE: Steve understood what that was all about, and when he heard her do it, he knew what I was talking about. 
LAURENTS: When we were out of town, it was Easter-Passover and Jule decided to give a seder. Ethel Merman, who had been born Zimmerman and was always terrified that somebody would think she was Jewish. She was German, and if you ran into her on the streets in Philadelphia and you said, "What did you do today, Ethel?" she would say, "Oh I was praying for the show -- in church!" Anyway, at rehearsals, she always had a turkey sandwich. So Jule invites her to the seder. She says to me, "But what am I going to eat?" I said, "You're not going to have to eat any Christian babies, you'll have capon, which is chicken, Ethel, chicken." Well, the night came and she dressed very properly, a little black dress, she even seemed to have less hair. Jule escorted her to the seat of honor. And she sat down, she opened her bag and took out a ham sandwich and put it on the plate. And Jule looked at her. This was his star, but it was his seder. So he picked up the sandwich and threw it on the floor. He said, "Ethel, you're insulting the waiters." And then he turned around, she couldn't see him and he broke up. 
GREY: Styne's ability to write great material for renowned singers like Merman was called upon for "Funny Girl," a show based on the legendary Fanny Brice. 

[00:54:16]


[ Orchestra plays, crowd cheers ] ?????? Everyone was singing, dancing, springing ?????? ?????? At a wedding yesterday ?????? ?????? Yiddle on his fiddle played some ragtime ?????? ?????? And when Sadie heard him play ?????? 
GREY: It was no mean feat to find a performer to take on the role of Fanny Brice. Fanny was a one-of-a-kind musical talent who could make people both laugh and cry. After considering a number of versatile actresses, Jule Styne went to a cabaret show down in Greenwich Village. 
MARGARET: She opened her mouth, one note came out, and my arm was practically broken because Jule was pressing down so hard. "This woman must play Funny Girl!" He was absolutely, right then, convinced, totally, 1,000%, and from there that... was the beginning of "Funny Girl." ?????? Lovers ?????? ?????? Are very special people ?????? ??????hey're the luckiest people ?????? ?????? In the world ?????? ?????? With one person ?????? ?????? One very special person ?????? ?????? A feeling deep in your soul ?????? ?????? Says you were half, now you're whole ?????? ?????? No more hunger and thirst ?????? ?????? But first be a person who needs people ?????? What I wanted to do was take advantage of all these vocal talents that she had. When you know somebody, it's like you write for Merman, you go further because you know they're going to make it. ?????? The luckiest people in the... ?????? And I accomplished it in "Rain on My Parade." You know, like how's a girl gonna sing...?

Rain on my ?????? ?????? Parade... ?????? 
GREY: In 1964, the same year "Funny Girl" opened, the unimaginable happened -- a musil devoted entirely to a Jewish story came to Broadway. Seven decades earlier, a violent pogrom had forced Irving Berlin's family to flee their Russian village. Now a pogrom on stage would disrupt a wedding celebration in a Broadway musical. We should introduce ourselves. In place of your usual glamorous hosts, you have two frightened writers today. This is Sheldon Harnick, who wrote the lyrics to "Fiddler on the Roof." And this is Jerry Bock, who wrote the music to "Fiddler on the Roof." And conducting the orchestra today, Milton Green, who conducts the orchestra at the Imperial for us every night. There was the skeptical feeling that this might not be a universal show, if any show can be termed "universal," appealing to almost everybody. But this show more than others might be specifically designed for just a certain group of people. And we had this in mind, without destroying any of the authenticity or the folklore or the color of the show. We didn't want to limit it just for the appreciation of a small group. 

[00:58:48]


HARNICK: Many people have said, "Oh you were so brave." We didn't feel that way. I thought, I'm a Jew, I fought Hitler. Uh, certainly the American people, we all fought Hitler. What's so, what's so brave, what's so avant-garde about doing a show about Jews? So we did. We did many backers' auditions for the women who sell theater parties, and many of them were Jewish because they reped Jewish they represented Jewish groups. Usually the way the audition would go is that I would explain whathe book was in brief, and Jerry Bock and I would then sing some of the score. ?????? May the Lord protect and defend you ?????? ?????? May the Lord preserve you from pain ?????? ?????? Favor them, o Lord ?????? ?????? With happiness and peace ?????? ?????? O hear our Sabbath prayer ?????? ?????? A... ?????? ?????? Men ?????? Hal Prince, who was our producer, after we'd do the backers audition, he would have to get up and really try and convince these ladies that the show was going to be fun and not just a show that had a pogrom at the end of the first act and an exile at the end of the second act. So Hal had his work cut out for him because these women were very sensitive, and they thought, "Our audiences are not going to like this." They asked me to direct it, and I said, "I'm the wrong guy. You've got to get Jerry Robbins or someone like him." He can give it a universality with movement. So it won't be just for a narrow audience. And the first question that Jerome Robbins asked was, What is this show about? We explained what we thought the show was about and Robbins, to our surprise, said no, that's not what gives these stories their power. And time and again, at all these meetings, he would say, what is this show about? And we'd say, well, it's about this, this farmer, and we'd start to describe the plot, he'd say, "No." And then finally, one day, I believe it was Sheldon Harnick said, "Well, I mean it's about tradition, what else is it about?" And Jerry said, "That's what it's about, write about tradition." ?????? Who day and night must scramble for a living ?????? ?????? Feed a wife and children, Say his daily prayers ?????? ?????? And still ?????? Ah, that's the old lyric. Everything evolves. ?????? Who day and night must scramble for a living ?????? ?????? Feed a wife and children, say his daily prayers ?????? ?????? And who has the right as master of the house ?????? ?????? To have the final word at home? ?????? And the daughter's theme was... ?????? And who does Mama teach ?????? ?????? To mend and hem and fix ?????? ?????? Prepa me to mar ?????? Preparing me to marry ?????? ?????? Whoever Papa picks? ?????? ?????? Tradition! ?????? ?????? Tradition! ?????? ?????? Tradition! ?????? ?????? Tradition! ?????? 

[01:02:17]


PRINCE: The opening number, "Tradition," was common to every culture, so the show was as common to Japanese family life as it was to Jewish family life. And it went all over the world, and every single place it went, it became their family story despite the idiosyncrasies of what was Jewish about it. ?????? If I were a rich man ?????? ?????? Yubby dibby dibby dibby dibby dibby dibby dum ?????? ?????? All day long I'd biddy biddy bum ?????? ?????? If I were a wealthy man ?????? ?????? I wouldn't have to work hard ?????? ?????? Iddle-diddle daidle-daidle-dee ?????? ?????? Lord who made the lion and the lamb ?????? ?????? You decreed I should be what I am ?????? ?????? Would it spoil some vast eternal plan? ?????? ?????? If I were a wealthy ?????? ?????? Man... ?????? 
MASLON: "Fiddler on the Roof" is not just a success, it's a massive blockbuster. And it opens the door for Jewish stories on Broadway in a way that's absolutely unprecedented. There are musicals about stories from the Old Testament, musicals set on the Lower East Side with Jewish families. There's musicals set in the suburbs with Jewish families. So the fact that you could have a successful Jewish musical just ushers in a tidal wave of Jewish themed shows. 
[ Applause ] ?????? Willkommen, bienvenue, welcome! ?????? ?????? Fremde, ??tranger, stranger ?????? 
GREY: The time was finally right for Broadway to take on the most sensitive theme in the modern Jewish canon -- the rise of Nazi Germany. ?????? Willkommen, bienvenue, welcome! ?????? ?????? Im Cabaret, au Cabaret, to Cabaret ?????? 

[01:04:31]


GREY: The creative team behind "Cabaret" fearlessly dramatized the intolerance that had forced Kurt Weill out of his homeland. They would use his wife, Lotte Lenya, as the emotional centerpiece of the show. 
LENYA: ?????? With time rushing by ?????? ?????? What would you do? ?????? ?????? With the clock running down ?????? ?????? What would you do? ?????? 
KANDER: We were dealing with an historical moment in which Jews were very much involved. The fact that one of the characters is Jewish is very important to the plot. ?????? If you were me ?????? It took place in a world in which anti-Semitism would reach its zenith, obviously, with the slaughter. It's not about, I don't think -- It's not about Jewishness; it's about hatred. And the danger of not being aware of what's going on around you. ?????? I know what you're thinking ?????? ?????? You wr why I chose her ?????? ?????? Out of all the ladies in the world ?????? ?????? That's just the first impression ?????? "If You Could See Her Through My Eyes" was written for Joel Grey and a gorilla. It's a very gentle little vaudeville song which goes... ?????? If you could see her through my eyes ?????? It's just this kind of simple melody. Now what could be more innocent than that? And it was a love song to this gorilla across the stage, and it ended with, "If you could see her through my eyes, she wouldn't look Jewish at all." And it was clearly illustrative of what had happened to Germany. 

[01:07:10]


[ Audience chuckles ] That line -- "She wouldn't look Jewish at all" -- was a real slap in the face. We wanted people to realize what anti-Semitism is really like, what real prejudice comes with. It comes with jokes. What I guess we were naive about was how Jewish audiences would react to that. And it came as a shock to realize that they thought we were saying Jews looked like gorillas. 
GREY: The songwriters' aim to depict an aspect of anti-Semitism with a kind of dark humor did not play well with some of the theater-going public. I was not only the director but the producer of that show, and I said, "We're going to change it." We're playing with fire all over the place. We've got Nazis on the stage. We're asking so much of an audience at a time when this is not the currency of musicals. I won't do it. But when the movie was made, and that was that many years later, the public had followed us and caught onto it and was more sophisticated. ?????? Oh, I understand your objection ?????? ?????? I grant you the problem's not small ?????? ?????? But if you could see her ?????? ?????? Through my eyes... ?????? She wouldn't look Jewish at all! 
[ Band plays ] 

[01:09:21]


GREY: The anti-Semitism at the core of "Cabaret" may have seemed to some audiences like something long ago and far away, but it happened in America as well. 
STROUSE: When I was growing up, my father thought it would be good for us to work on a farm. He was in the tobacco business and sent us up to a farm. And we saw right away that the young men were virulently anti-Semitic. Everybody was, "the Jew boss," "the Jew driver." So my brother and I made a pact to say, if they shou ever ask us, that we were Greek Orthodox... Greek Orthodox, 'cause we were dark, you know, fairly dark. But one day they said that, "You guys are Jewish," my brother and me. And they started to beat up my brother. About six of them. And then they tied me to a tree, they tied me to a tree and put papers under it and lit a fire. I remember the smoke and inhaling it. And I remember them pummeling my brother. And then the straw boss, whose name was Murphy, came along and they said, "Aw, here comes, here comes the Jew boss, we better stop." And he set us free. Didn't say anything about it. He said, "All right, come on, lunchtime is over." That was all. 
KUN: One of the ways I think you can look at the "sing and be happy" poptimismof the Broadway stage is that it's a release valve. It allows you to sing your way into a new world. ?????? Gray skies are gonna clear up ?????? ?????? Put on a happy face ?????? ?????? Brush off the clouds and cheer up ?????? ?????? Put on a happy face ?????? ?????? Take off the gloomy mask of tragedy ?????? ?????? It's not your style ?????? ?????? You look so good that you'll be glad ?????? ?????? You decided to smile ?????? ?????? Pick out a pleasant outlook ?????? ?????? Stick out that noble chin ?????? ?????? Wipe off the full-of-doubt look ?????? ?????? Slap on a happy grin ?????? ?????? And spread sunshine all over the place ?????? ?????? Just put on a happy face ?????? 

[01:11:55]


PRINCE: He and his partner, Lee Adams, write quintessentially up, optimistic songs, what you associate with America. And it's, it's, it's wonderful. Probably one of the best songs they ever wrote was "Put On A Happy Face." It's a credo. And it's built into the material they write. 
STROUSE: The song became famous. You know sometimes people say, "Do you know what's going to be a hit?" I have no idea, but that song turned out to be one of the reasons I have this apartment. 
GREY: Strouse tapped into the Broadway optimism again when he scored an adaptation of the Little Orphan Annie comic strip, working in collaboration with lyricist Martin Charnin. ?????? Just thinking about tomorrow ?????? ?????? Clears away the cobwebs ?????? ?????? And the sorrow ?????? ?????? 'Til there's none ?????? ?????? When I'm stuck with a day ?????? ?????? That's grey ?????? ?????? And lonely ?????? ?????? I just stick out my chin ?????? ?????? And grin ?????? ?????? And say ?????? ?????? Oh! ?????? ?????? The sun'll come out tomorrow ?????? ?????? So you got to hang on 'til tomorrow ?????? ?????? Come what may ?????? ?????? Tomorrow, tomorrow ?????? ?????? I love you, tomorrow ?????? ?????? You're only a day away ?????? ?????? Tomorrow... ?????? 
KUN: Many have claimed that, in the late 20th century, Jews became mainstream American culture. That in the literary world, in theater, in film, Jews were American pop culture in a way that was very different from the pre-World War II years. Where no longer were they outsiders working in but they were now ders working on the inside. And that's a huge shift. 

[01:14:15]


MAN: We made it. We made it! But then you have Sondheim coming along, Stephen Sondheim. He's another generation along. And he's sort of saying, "Look, we have everything. Aren'te supposed to be happy?" And his shows consistently are questioning, is the American dream, in fact, fulfilling the promise? Yes, we've gained acceptance in this country. Does that mean we're happy? ?????? Isn't it rich? ?????? ?????? Are we a pair? ?????? ?????? Me here at last on the ground ?????? ?????? You in mid-air ?????? ?????? Send in the clowns ?????? 
GREY: Whether inspired by a Swedish film, a Victorian horror story, or assassination attempts on U.S. presidents, Stephen Sondheim's work has illuminated both the joyful and the terrible side of humanity. ?????? One who keeps tearing around ?????? ?????? One who can't move ?????? 
SONDHEIM: People do want you to come out and say something either positive or negative. They don't like the idea that you're saying something positive and negative. But even in the most simple-minded musicals, you know, you get a song, an Irving Berlin musical where, "I hate you but I love you." I mean ambivalence is the stuff of drama. I don't know why people have made so much out of it. It's just that I tend to deal with it on a more realistic level than it has been dealt with in musicals before. Or had been, I should say. And, uh, but ambivalence is what drama is about. 
MAN: Stephen Sondheim changed Broadway. He created a world where you can write about everything and anything and nothing is off limits. All sorts of music can be used. To go from "Sweeney Todd" and "Passion" to the pastiche work in "Follies" or the contemporary music of its time that was in "Company," and on and on and on. But the bad part is he made it that everyone is expecting that now from everyone. And not everyone can deliver that. And sometimes you go to the theater and you don't want that. Musicals started going in very interesting and offbeat directions. I had three major hits in the sixties -- "Milk and Honey," "Hello, Dolly!" and "Mame," all came pouring out of me. And I thought you just wrote a musical and it ranor seven years. But then the seventies came, I thought that the kind of stuff I did was over and nobody wanted the quintessential Broadway musical any longer. 

[01:17:19]


GREY: In 1983, Jerry Herman and his collaborators brought the old-fashioned musical back with the classic "outsider seeking acceptance" theme. But this time, the central characters were a gay couple, one of whom s a drag queen. 
MAN: The drag character does what's become a sort of anthem in our community 
-- "I am what I am." ?????? I am what I am ?????? ?????? I don't want praise ?????? ?????? I don't want pity ?????? I have been beaten, I've been made fun of, they've called me names, but I do not, for any of that, say I'm not me. ?????? So it's time to open up your closet ?????? ?????? Life's not worth a damn ?????? ?????? 'Til you can say ?????? ?????? "Hey, world ?????? ?????? I am ?????? ?????? What ?????? ?????? I am!" ?????? 
[ Applause ] 
HECHT: The musical represents mainstream America and I think that when a people are presented on Broadway and accepted on Broadway, groups that were formerly viewed with suspicion have a shot at acceptance, a way in. And this is largely because of what Jews did to create the musical. The 2001 Tony Award for Best New Musical, "The Producers." Behind me you see a phalanx, an avalanche of Jews who have come with their talent, their money, their spirit and their love for the theater. And that's what brings us all together tonight. We all love this thing called the theater. It was always my dream to marry comedy with music with dancing. That's called a musical comedy. ?????? Springtime for Hitler and Germany ?????? ?????? Look, it's springtime ?????? ?????? Winter for Poland and France ?????? 

[01:19:54]


GREY: In 2001, M Brooks' outrageous musical "The Producers" won a record- breaking twelve Tony Awards. It brought Nazi characters back to Broadway, but this time, Jewish audiences roared with delight. 
BROOKS: How do you get even with Adolf Hitler? How do you get even with him? There is only one way to get even. You have to bring him down with ridicule. ?????? Heil myself ?????? ?????? Watch my show ?????? ?????? I'm the German Ethel Merman, don't you know ?????? 
BROOKS: One of my lifelong jobs has been to make the world laugh at Adolph Hitler. ?????? Make a great big smile, everyone sieg heil ?????? ?????? To me ?????? ?????? Wonderful ?????? ?????? Me! ?????? 
BROOKS: Look at the musicals. Look at the musical comedies we have exported. They say happiness. They say hope. They say we're tough. They say we can survive. They say we're sharp. We're hip. We're America. The Broadway musical distinguishes us from every other country in the world. ?????? Who can say if I've been changed for the better? ?????? ?????? But because I knew you ?????? ?????? I have been changed ?????? ?????? For good ?????? 
SIDRAN: Americans have this self-image that we are the refuge of the downtrodden. We have this self-image that we care about one another. And this music has defined -- to us and to the world -- how we care and why we care about each other. ?????? Because I knew you ?????? ?????? Because I knew you ?????? ?????? I have been changed ?????? For good ?????? 

[01:22:28]


[ Applause ] 
SHAIMAN: The work of the Jewish songwriters who write for Broadway, have written songs and music that have become so universal. I'm proud to be a Jew, to be a part of this group of people that has this ability to put an emotion into music. 
JAMIE: American musical theater is one of the jewels in the American cultural crown. 
FURIA: It's the closest thing America has to a living, enduring body of classical music. That's the Jewish legacy to America and America's legacy to the world. more, first...

At the heart of austria's imperial palace of the hofburg, stands the magnifice baroque national library. This soaring space is a majestic symbol of an empire and its pride of culture. Hello everybody and a happy new year to you all. I'm julie andrews. Today we'll highlight the music of richard wagner on this, the 200th anniversary of his birth. And as tradition demands, vienna's musikverein will resound with the music of austria's waltz king -- johann strauss. Today, the celebrated austrian conductor franz velser-moest leads the vienna philharmonic in the golden hall, while the vienna state ballet performs at this splendid hunting palace in the austrian countryside. It's all happening next on great performances. >>> Great performances is brought to you by -- the irene dimond fund, major funding is also made possible by vienna maria and steven kellen arts fund, vivien milstein, vera von kufner eberstadt, the star

Thank you. [ Applause ] >> hello everyone, I'm so delighted to return to vienna at this magical time of year. Today, especially, the gleaming golden hall of the musikverein it is a treat for all the senses! As wen to the heavenly sounds of the vienna philharmonic, we're surrounded by the scent of thousands of spring-time blossoms from san remo on the italian riviera. This year the renowned conductor franz welser-moest is making his second appearance since becoming the musical director of the vienna state opera. He's also well known to many music lers in the states as the music director of the cleveland orchestra. Together, he and the vienna philharmonic have chosen today's program. Now, just to remind us all, the waltz king was the eldest of three brothers -- composers and conductors all. Today's concert will feature several beautiful waltzes by johann's middle brother, joseph. A shy, self-effacing man, he was known as the "schubert of the waltz." We'll begin with probably his most famous piece, the music of the spheres. This composition was based on an ancient philosophical concept that the movements of the planets and the stars produced a perfectly harmonious celestial music, inaudible to mere mortals 

[00:04:02]


such as us. Yet, their unique hum created harmony for life on earth. Examples of our ancestors' fascination with the skies are on display at the austrian national library's globe museum, the only one of its kind in the world. Here are terrestrial and celestial globes, armilla spheres and models of our solar system. Now, let us listen as the ethereal opening bars of "music of the spheres" transport us to other worlds.

[ applause ] >> we've just heard "music of the spheres" by the waltz king's brother, joseph strauss, a piece whose opening bars were inspired by richard wagner. This year in anticipation of the festivities surrounding the wagner bicentennial year, the national library has launched an exhibition with the provocative title -- "loved, ridiculed, worshipped: 

[00:14:53]


Richard wagneand the viennese." Now, I thought an expert might just be in order to enlighten us. Welcome maestro and first of all a very happy new year to you also. >> The same to you. >> So, tell me, what was wagner's relationship with vienna? >> A stormy one. >> Really? >> Absolutely. He came to vienna and before he conducted here, tannhaueser, he rented immediately the entire second floor of the hotel imperial with no money which was a very bold move. >> I'll say. >> And then there were two camps -- one which really admired him, and the other one which said that's not really good music. So, yeah absolutely. There's always a very conservative part of vienna and there's a part that always tries to look forward into the future and -- already then -- 150 years ago. >> And how was his relationship with the strauss family? >> You know all composers of that time admired the strauss family. And in the case of wagner, they, johann strauss' orchestra, was the first to play a note by wagner here in vienna. Won't you please introduce the next piece, and tell me why you chose it. >> We decided to go for something which is within the character of the entire concert, festive and happy so we picked "the four schpiel" to the third act of "lohingrin." >> Well, I look forward to hearing it and thank you so much maestro. >> Thank you!

           ??????
[ applause ] >> the historical period between 1815 and 1848 was known as the biedermeier period. For austria, it was an era of urbanization and the rise of the middle class. Art and music were now centered on the home and feelings of gemutlichkeit, a cozy domesticity and security, and simplicity. We are in the marvelous imperial furniture collection housing centuries of royal household treasures. This warm music room reflects the biedermeier style perfectly with these beautiful chairs and a stand set for a string quartet and also this fanciful viennese "giraffe" piano. The illusion of a brazilian jungle is brilliantly reflected in the extravagant wallpaper. The next polka "unter vier augen" -- roughly translated meaning between four eyes, directly reflects the intimacy of the biedermeier spirit. It infers that a conversation between two close friends is strictly "in confidence." Its composer, a colleague of the waltz king, was both concertmaster and conductor of

the vienna philharmonic.

>> our next piece was written by joseph strauss for a carnival ball given right here in the golden hall by the hesperus artists socy. Today, the tradition flourishes as the philharmoniker ball. For viennese society, it continues to be a highlight of each carnival season. Strauss's title, "hesperus' path," honors the society and paints a musical picture of the god's journey as the evening star through the night sky.

[ applause ] >> austria's greatest defender during the ottoman wars was a transplanted frenchman, eugene of savoy. His summer palace in vienna, the belvedere, was the wonder of europe, and this "little versailles," his princely baroque hunting lodge schloss hof has now been lovingly restored to its long lost splendor. Prince eugene's personal quarters in the palace, his bedroom, dining, and game rooms, seem so fresh and welcoming for us even today. Outsite the seven terraces of gardens have been lovingly reconstructed interestingly enough with the aid of none other than thomas jefferson. During his service as america's ambassador to france, h traveled throughout europe collecting seed and today the gardens of his home monticello in virginia remain a botanic showpiece of his time. Jefferson's seeds from monticello, donated in recent years to schloss hof, vibrantly 

[00:36:06]


recall for us that beautiful and graceful past. After a day of hunting, elaborate games, dance and music ensued. The vienna state ballet imagines a playful summer garden party where one is just never sure whose partner is whose!

      ??????
[ applause ] >> southwest of vienna, is a high land of alpine peaks and rolling farmlands, of monasteries, castles and churches. It is known as the green heart of austria called styria. Just 15 minutes from the musikverein, on the edge of the vienna woods, a little bit of styria can be found at the tavern steirerstoeckl. Originally built as a shelter for hikers in 1917, today the tavern serves the traditional old recipes from the styrian region with game, vegetables and fruit from the owner's own meadows, fields and orchards back home. More than 200 years ago, in rural taverns such as this, peasants would grasp each other arm in arm and dance in a rollicking three-quarter time. Eventually, two young viennese musicians, joseph lanner and johann strauss senior, would refine these dances into the waltz we know today. Lanner paid homage to these humble folk melodies with his beautiful styrian dances.

 ??????
[ applause ] >> the seminal works of the german poet johann wolfgang goethe ignited the romantic impulse for artists in every art form of the nineteenth century. His poem "mignon's lied" inspired compositions by beethoven, schubert, and, yes, johann strauss. Its opening line, a hymn to italy, is probably the most famous in all of german poetry. Translated, it says, "do you know the land where the lemon trees blossom? Where golden oranges glow among dark leaves, where the soft breezes blow in the blue sky, and the sweet myrtle and stately laurel grow? Do you of know it? There, I long to go, my beloved, to go with you." I'm here in the orangerie of the famed abbey church of klosterneuburg founded in 1114, which in 2014 means it will celebrate its 900th year. With its host of precious treasures, it's austria's escorial -- both royal palace and monastery in one. And in charming greenhouses such as this, the viennese nobility could cheat winter and dream of the distant south, of bella italia.

           ??????
[ applause ] >> this next piece, "the carnival of venice," started life as a silly little italian folk song, "my dear sweet mama." But austrian children for centuries have known it as, "my hat, it has three corners, three corners has my hat, and had it not three corners, it would not be my hat!" With its endless repeats, it's still gleefully sung in some form or another by children everywhere. Papa strauss' friend, the violin virtuoso heinrich wilhelm ernst, devised a showstopping set of variations on the tune for his fans' amusement. In tribute to the violinist and to demonstrate his own orchestra's technical brilliance, strauss senior wrote "memories of ernst."

>> wasn't that a delightful way to wrap up today's official program! It's a humorous tribute to the virtuosity of the variou sections of the vienna philharmonic. But the festivities are far from over! Tradition demands three encores from the orchestra. The first one will be a quick polka that joseph strauss entitled "little chatterbox." He dedicated it to his only child, karoline anna. The orchestra plays it today as a birthday surprise to celebrate joseph's great granddaughter's 90th year. She's with us in the audience as their special guest.

[01:09:54]


whose air lie the sounds which my ear gathers, which my heart takes in and my hand writes down. My vienna, city of songs and of spirit, which lovingly helped the boy onto his feet and which always offered the mature man its friendship. Vienna, bloom, prosper and grow!"

>> I'm pleased to yield two minutes to the gentleman from colorado. 
>> The colorado from colorado is recognized for two minutes. 
>> I want to acknowledge the long service of our chair in the house and that could well be the last time we have the opportunity to debate here on the house floor and I wish him well 86 want to express my gratitude to the great patriotism of colleagues democratic and republican particularly those in their lame duck period who have chose ton stay around and work right up to the final hour of the contract with the americ people in many cases without an office. In many cases without a home. We see them roaming the halls here of the capital. Regardless of how they come down on this particular issue applaud their patriotism and their will for voting for the 112th congress. What we have before us has some good aspects andome aspects that need to be improved. The question is on what side there is more weight. It is important to talk about what this bill does and what it doesn't do. What it doesn't do. Michael bennett is one of the small group of senators who voted against it because he like myself a an advocate of a comprehensive budget solution, reis storing fiscal parameters to our country. Along the parameters of what the bowles simpson commission the gang of eight ait tempted to accomplish. It is so important to the future of our country to balance the budget and restore the fiscal integrity. This bill is not that bill. However, what this bill does is it ensures that the american people will not have the largest tax increase in the history of our country tomorrow. 2,000 a year out of the pocket of families making $80,000 a year. Almost $4,000 a year out of the pocket of families making $150,000 a year. What does that mean to families? It might be the money that helps them stay above water on their mortgage. It might be the money that alous their child to attend college. Beyond the ramifications at the family level there aggregate effect across the economy. When families don't have that money they it are not able to spend the money to buy products that need to be produced. Have jobs in america and create jobs. I think we need to make sure that we don't raise taxes on the american people. The best way to do that is by supporting this bill. Anybody opposing this bill is supporting the largest tax increase in the history of the country. I call upon my colleagues democratic and republican to remove this tax burden from the middle class and ensure that taxes don't go up tomorrow. I encourage my colleagues to support the rule and the bill and I yield back the balance of my time. 

[00:02:43]


>> Gentleman, time is expired. The gentleman from california. 
>> Bret: By the way, the chair there is congressman ben quayle the son of the former vice president. And he lost his race in arizona but is now chairing this debate in the 112th congress. The debate on the rule. It continues before we get to the debate and the vote on the senate bill. As we talk about and look at live at the house floor we will cover all of the action here on fox news channel. I want to bring in our panel tonight. Steve hayes, senior writer for the weekly standard. A.B. Stoddard associate editor of the hill and charles krauthammer. Looks like it could be a long evening here. The bottom line is it looks like republicans going to hein up behind this fiscal cliff legislation. 
>> I think at the end of the long road or at the bottom of the cliff but we are now being returned to the top because nothing really happens until the markets open tomorrow. And this will be done before the markets open. And this will pass. And that means that everything drastic that would have happened automatically, the hike in tax rates, income tax rates for everybody, the alternative minimum tax, all of these things which have taken a huge bite out of consumers and citizens that is all going to be avoided. This was sort of written in stone for two reasons as of yesterday. Number one, the republican leadership does not have a fallback. They thought they might have one which is to do an amendment, send it to the senate but they realized that would be a loser. The president would come out and denounce and the senate wouldn't look at it. The other reason is the size of the vote last night in the senate. 89-9. I think it was 89-9. Which was so overwhelming it it really left the republican in the house with no option. Had it been a close vote say in THE THE MID 50s YOU COULD Have had republicans in the house saying we have to amend this. But if so many republicans agreed to this in the senate it is a done deal and it will be done tonight. 

[00:05:02]


>> Bret: A.B., We are watching well basically the sausage being made in washington and increasingly here it has been legislative action that is pushed up against a cliff and you have seen it time and time again and we are going to see it again in just a matter of weeks against the debt ceiling debate where republicans it appears if they pass this which it seems they will will really have their spending cut battle then. 
>> Right. What you will hear in the hours to follow, the passage of this band aid is that it is so great because it provided new tax cuts that expired yesterday for 99% of taxpayers and on and on. About how we were rescued from the cliff and the republic will survive. But it is true that this really didn't anything -- didn't do anything to address our problems and new fights ensue. The sequester which was designed in the budget control act of august of 2011 which ed henry was referring to originally to control our budget did not. The sequestered cuts that were so hideous that neither party could live with them live on. We have a two month patch until we deal with the cuts again. The debt ceiling increase to battle over. That fight is going to start right up again. But solutions to it will not come right away. So we are going to be again at cross hairs politically but then up against another brink. There will not be serious hearings and real negotiations, lots of give and take, concessions from both sides like we have seen in the last 48 hours. We will not have that in the next 48 days. It will be at the last minute again. It will be just like this. 
>> Bret: Steve? 
>> I will think that is exactly right. This was the case if you go back to july of 2011 it was clear at least I thought at that point that it was and the matter of time, it was matter of courage. You can lengthen the time as we have done repeatedly throughout the various commissions and discussions. And it doesn't solve the problem. You actually need to get to the point where you get serious about spending. I think first and foremost it will choir presidential leadership. This is something that has not been in evidence. We haven't seen this president eager to get serious about debt and deficits. From the very he beginning of his administration. Remember it was in the weeks before he was inaugural rated in inaugurated. He said entitlement reform would be central to the ability to rein in spending. Even in discussions in 2011 about the debt ceiling the president never put forward a real proposal. He talked about being open to serious medicare rforms. We didn't actually see it from the white house. I don't expect we will see it in the next couple of months. Once this is in it the rear view mirror republicans have advantages going into the next series of discussions. Not only will it be about the debt ceiling but you will have a focus on spending on the way that we haven't had to this point. The president of the united states starting with the state of the union last year focused on raising taxes and talked about it as the way to solve the deficit problem and talked about the buffett rule in 70sANTLY AND CAMPAIGNED ON Raising taxes on the wealthy and gave the american people the impression that he could take serious steps toward resolving our fiscal issues by raising taxes. Now, taxes have been raised. Done mostly what he wanted us to do. The focus now has to be on spending. I think the president can't very well say we need more revenues and we need to raise taxes. We have done that. Now, the focus really has to be on spending. 

[00:08:49]


>> Bret: If you looked at his deficit and debt commission, the simpson bowles commission and recommendations that came out of there and what has not been followed through now two years ago, is remarkable. 
>> He is not interested in that. He is not interested in cutting spending. I think if you look at this in the large view it is becoming clear who he is and what he wants to do. He is now in the is second term. He is liberated and he can be open about what he wants to do. He once said in '08 that ray regan was a historical president in a way that a clinton or a nixon was not. Regan changed the nature of the country and got it hooked on low taxes, less government and increase in inequality as obama sees it. He sees his historic role to undo reganism not to cut spending, it is to raise taxes. He let the cat out of the bag monday. In the little rally he held he said to republicans you are not getting any spending cuts today and you know that. He said if you think you can get spending cuts after this in the rest of the negotiations the answer is no. If you want to cut in spending you have to increase taxes on the rich. Remember he got an increase in revenues now by raising the rates on the rich. Well, now he is going to return as he said on monday and get increased revenue from the rich by eliminating deductions. The other way to do it. So he has no interest in anything other than raising the taxation to preregan levels so he can support the entitlement stake which is what his presidency is all about. A very long view and I think he is attacking it exactly the right way if you were of his ideology. 
>> Bret: We'll be back with the panel throughout the night and have breaking news. As we head to break, congressman david dreyle er from california. Take a listen. He is retiring. This could be one of the last speeches on the house floor.

>> Bret: Looking live at the house floor, congressman david dreier the chairman of the house rules committee, getting ready, preparing the house to vote on the senate-passed bill dealing with the fiscal cliff. We heard tonight already mike eman yell and ed henry talk about this legislation that passed the senate overwhelmingly and some of the sticking points that the house conservatives have had throughout the day. Now, white house correspondent wendel goeller takes an in depth look. 
>> The bill as amended is passed. 
>> The senate deal passed with overwhelming bipartisan support, extending the bush era tax cuts for families making less than $450,000 a year and making the lower rates permanent, something former president bush was unable to do because he wasn't able to get two thirds of the stat to go along. That part most republicans are happy with. 
>> Makes some things permanent in the estate fax area and permanent fix to the amt. There are some actual things we like about it. 

[00:15:20]


>> The deal saves 30 million people from having to pay the alternative minimum tax by indexing it to inflation. It raises the death tax but the payroll tax will go back to 6.2% an increase willle cost a worker making $100,000 a year about $2,000 more. On the spending side, the deal extends long-term unemployment benefits for are another year. Democrats had insisted on it. 
>> It is critical. Want to talk about the real cliff? It is for the people who are about to lose their unemployment compensation. If that is not in the deal that deal is a real problem. 
>> There is a five year extension of stimulous tax credits for alternative energy conversion and businesses can take a depreciation on new equipment and buildings. All cuts in medicare payments put another year. 
>>> The catch all measure even extends a dairy subsidy to keep milk prices from spiking. But the lack of a presidential agreement to cut spending means even if the senate measure passes the house mr. Obama can expect added pressure in a matter of weeks when the nation's debt ceiling must be raised again. 
>> We made the mistake when we increased the debt limit the first time and gave that guy all the money to buy votes with and we shouldn't make the same mistake now. 
>> The president says congress shouldn't do that because it holds the nation's credit rang hostage but some republicans say that s the only way the guts will happen. Bret? 
>> Bret: As you look live at the house floor we should point out that these are house controlled cameras. We don't control these familiar as. As you look at congressman dreier speaking on the house floor what you can't see is there are not that many lawmakers in the house chamber, in fact, just a few. We just got word that house minority leader nancy pelosi has walked in but there are just a few ple listening to congressman dreier. You are one of them here as we have dipped in a couple of times. Bring back our panel to talk about the specifics of this legislation. Charles the angst in republican circles was about the lack of spending cuts. What republicans who are look at this as a positive are saying is one a permanent protection against the alternative minimum tax, the amt. The deals that they got in here that they don't think they would have gotten up to the bush tax cuts making the tax rates extending for all income up to $400,000 individually, $450,000 for married couples. Are there things in here that republicans can say you know what, this is -- this is a good deal in one sense? 

[00:18:22]


>> Well, there are thing there's is a really a national consensus on. The doc fix which would automatically kick in a reduction in the amount of payment that a doctor would get for a medicare patient which there was a built in law in the THE '90s TO CUT THE SPENDING In medicare. It was a complete disaster. Every year it gets waved. And the idea of getting permanence with the estate tax is a good idea. Otherwise how do you plan and how do you invest and when do you hire. You know, when do you die. All of these things are really important to do. I think you could have gotten a consensus any day of the week. Real egregious stuff if you are a republican, the price you have to it pay if the other guys win the election and then of course o the fact that you got ciro in spending and not only that but you got a president who said you are not going to get any now and in the future I will extract higher taxes yet on the rich if you want any spending cuts. I think the fight on spending s beginning and obama is going to be very entrenched on this. 
>> Bret: There you see the wide shot from the house. Not that many lawmakers are there. The vote, the tally is on again the vote on the rule. Not the vote on the actual bill but seth the table for the actual bill. One minute left, a.B., Here. The no spending cut deal in fact increasing spending on the deficit and debt bill that originally that was the purpose of the supercommittee and the purpose of the whole process. 
>> That's true but tax cuts cost money. That is just the truth. And republicans wanted more. But there are some things that would have happened to our economy that really would have been quite scary and charles you mentioned some of them. Truly, the stimulus money doesn't -- is not -- was not going to affect the economy. But the medicare providing doctors closing up their clinics taking a 30% pay cut. The milk fromming go $4 a gallon to $8 or $3 to $8. The loss of the payroll tax cut along with the uninsured having checks cut off as we all lost our tax cuts was really going to be quite incredible and those things though they are not talked about the alternative minimum tax and medicare doc fix and form program that the farm state republicans are fighting for but the rest of the republican leadership was not. This was going be a huge consumer hit and felt pretty quick le. Those things had to be done and as I said earlier you will hear a lot of positive spin about how great they are. 

[00:21:07]


>> Bret: A quick break. Steve I promise you are on the other side with your thoughts about what is in this bill as we get ready for the house of representatives to take up the fiscal cliff legislation. We have you covered here on fox news channel throughout the night. A busy first day of 2013. rosa chantix. When the doctor told me that I could smoke for the first week... I'm like...Yeah, ok... Little did I know that one week later I wasn't smoking. 
[ Male Announcer ] ALONG WITH SUPPORT, Chantix is proven to help people quit smoking. It reduces the urge to smoke. Some people had changes in behavior, thinking or mood, hostility, agitation, depressed mood and suicidal thoughts or actions while taking or after stopping chantix. If you notice any of these stop taking chantix and call your doctor right away. Tell your doctor about any history of depression or other mental health problems, which could get worse while taking chantix. Don't take chantix if you've had a serus allergic or skin reaction to it. If you develop these stop taking chantix and see your doctor right away as some can be life-threatening. If you have a history of heart or blood vessel problems, tell your doctor if you have new or worse symptoms. Get medical help right away if you have symptoms of a heart attack.

>> Bret: Back live here in washington as the house of representatives takes up the senate passed fiscal cliff bill. This is as we as a country are already technically over the fiscal cliff which the deadline was new year's eve 2012. Actually when the clock struck midnight the first minute of 2013. But now the bill is being considered by the house of representatives currently they are voting on what is called the rule and then that will set up the actual debate and vote on the bill itself. We were talking about what is in this bill. There are aren't spending cuts. There -- there aren't spending cuts. There are tax cuts and some tax increases. Some rather spending increases, steve. Your take on the positives and negatives and how people will portray them? 
>> Well, think they are very few positives. I don't think there is any reason particularly if you are republican to go out and celebrate the fact that for 84% of people or whatever the number is it is a higher number than that, 84% of the bush tax cuts are going to be preserved. Are not worth celebrating the fact they will have the same tax rates for the middle class that they had for the past year. I don't see it that as a tremendous accomplishment. Particularly when you look at it in the context of the rest of the stuff in the bills from the tax enpen dithers and stimulus spending that charles is talking about to the tax hikes at a time when the economy isn't taking off. That doesn't sound like a great overall package. If would be like if I ordered a huge plate of nachos right now and pointed to the tomato as the nutritional value. We should focus on the tomato. 
>> Bret: I think I have seen this happen. 
>> And the sauce and jalapenos. Those are vegetables. A huge plate of nachos isn't good for you. Focusing on the tomato doesn't make it any better for you. It is just focusing on the tomato. 
>> Bret: There is something about the tax cuts being and liberal democrats arguing that the bush era tax cuts are going to help the economy, that is that some conservatives find refreshing. 

[00:26:46]


>> There is sort of a fun hypocrisy pop if you are a ervative or in favor of bush tax rates for the last decade and you know how strenuousl objected to them when they were first proposed. 
>> Bret: The big fight will happen really over the next six weeks as the debt ceiling we hit it probably the beginning of february, maybe middle of february. That debate and whether to raise the debt ceiling republicans have signald that they are going to use that to try to get spending cuts and entitlement reforms. 
>> And I expect it going to end up with a patch and what is from the point of view of our fiscal problems another failure as tonight. And the reason is if you have two elements in this the, the president and the republican house which will be on more equal strength and they will resist each other and go to the last minute and they will work out another useless extension and have to fight again. The reason I say that is that everybody spoke about what we would do tax reform after the election and entitlement reform after the election. We see a president now who is not interested in either and tax reform is the one thing that has debt reduction commission -- that his debt reduction commission had recommend the. When regan worked it out with tip o'neill in 1986 there was an enormous success. Eliminate the deductions and lower the rate. This will be a titanic struggle that will not be solved at debt ceiling time. 
>> Bret: Check in with mike emanuel up on the hill. We have cameras all over the hill watching things and the speaker of the house is on the move getting ready to vote for the rule. What are we looking at time wise here and what is the prospect for the big vote on the senate the-passed legislation? 

[00:28:52]


>> Bret, it sounds like they will wrap up this vote around 9:45 or so on the rule and then have another hour of debate. But honestly the vibe I'm getting from talking to different members is essentially this is kind of on the fast track at this point so to me it would be surprising if they took the full hour of debate to debate this measure when it feels kind of like they feel like they he have the votes to go forward with the bill. The fight really was earlier in the day when conservatives were arguing for spending cuts. They tried to see it they could find consensus on an amendment that would move forward but they were warned by their leadership if they passed the bill with the amendment there was no guarantee that the senate democrats would take it up and republicans could be blamed for going off the fiscal cliff. I can tell you from conversations with various conservatives up here on the hill, I asked them what should they like about this deal if anything and they talked about the permanence issue trying to avoid the washington -made crises if you will of expiring deals at the end of the year. Seems like every year the alternative minimum tax is a crisis at the end of the year. With the permanence it may give a little honesty in budgeting and some people may crack when congress actually does a budget. Honesty in terms of the cost of the alternative minimum tax will actually be on the books as opposed to something thrown in at end of the year and not counted officially.

>> Bret: Looking live at the house floor and an agreement on a resolution on the rule and you can see the yays at 263 and the nays at 4. Zero time remaining. The rule will pass. That is not a surprise. This is just laying the groundwork again for the vote on the major bill, the fiscal cliff legislation that passed the senate early in the morning with a vote of 89-8. And now it will be considered and voted on in the house. Just moments ago the house democratic caucus chair john larson said that he was happen ney they got a deal, wished it was a little different. Again, if a democratic perspective. Happy for the american people and glad speaker boehner kept his word on an up or down vote. We he just had new video of the speaker walking into the chamber, walking towards the chamber and there you see him getting ready to cast his vote on the rule. Let's listen. Do we have audio? It was the silent movie version of john boehner walking to the house chamber. But there was a lot of back and forth today among republicans and definitely within the media when the house majority leader eric cantor came up and said i do not support this bill. Mike emanuel back at his post on capitol hill. There was speculation, was this a move by cantor to create some friction? There will be a vote on speakership thursday when the new congress goes in, the 113th congress, noon on thursday. I guess his people are saying that that is not the case at all. 
>>> Well, that's right. They definitely were trying to walk us away from thinking that there s some soap opera going on here in the republican leadership in the house. But it has been a bruising fight in recent weeks for speaker john boehner. Remember, he was negotiating with president obama and walked away from the talks and brought up a plan b. And had 40 or 50 of his members say we will not support, that the idea of raising taxes on those making more than a million dollars. Behind closed doors is sunday night with the house republican conference multiple sources inside the room told me he got a standing ovation when thanked his rank and file for their support during this fight. So as of sunday night it sounded like the gang was essentially happy with the speaker but then you had a tough vote coming up here with a lot of conservatives in the house. The majority leader going out on the record saying I'm against this bill as it has come forward even though obviously reading the tea leaves and seeing the wide bipartisan vote from the senate a lot of people felt there was an inevitablity to the bill going forward. We we asked is there friction or a split they downplayed it and put out the same rehe action that there was unanimity of support and there was a lack of spending cuts in the deal but obviously with the ambitious politicians here on capitol hill you are always looking for the -- somebody trying to ascend to the throne if you will at a moment of weakness. We have been told that is not the case at this point. We saw the two men, eric cantor and speaker john boehner walking shoulder to shoulder earlier this evening. Undoubtedly after getting lots of questions about whether they were splitting and whether there was a feud in the family if you will. Bottom line, a difficult fight for speaker boehner and he will be up for reelection in a couple of days. 

[00:37:42]


>> Bret: One of the things that speaker boehner said is that he always wanted to maintain the denny hastert rule which is not to bring forth a vote unless they have a majority. In other words, that he wouldn't bring that piece of legislation to the floor. He likely is going face a scenario here unless he has whipped a lot of republican lawmakers into voting for this bill that he may have more democratic votes for this senate bill than republican votes. 
>> You are spot on there, bret. That is something we will be watching. You will be watching. We know that ty were outwhipping hard on this earlier this evening. They gave them two options essentially saying do we have 218 votes to go forward on one amendment that would cut spending or where are you on this deal. The senate passed deal that was negotiated between the senate the republican leader and the vice president of the united states. And so clearly they have counted heads. They know where people stand. And we will see. Obviously whether kevin mccarthy the house republican whip was able to get enough republicans to say at end of the day it is important that we not go off the fiscal cliff, that we not get blad for this or whether it is going be nancy pelosi's democrats that help pull this across the finish line in big numbers. 
>> Bret: Okay. Mike emanuel watching things up on capitol hill. You know, we just saw speaker boehner walk through what is called the will rogers hallway. Just the hallway right in front of the house chamber and beyond there is statutory hall where you see all of these statues of figures from really every state in the nation. The reason the hallway where we are positioned is called will rogers is because in the corner of that hall way is a giant statue of will rogers. So there is explaining that. We are back with the panel. Eric cantor just walked by as well. And people would say you know, why are you covering people walking by. You are getting ready for are this vote, a.B., Where as i mentioned you could potentially have a lot of democrats and maybe not as many republicans. Do you think that they have turned in the hours since there was all this back and forth enough republicans to say we are going to vote for this? 

[00:40:13]


>> It would be hard to imagine if they weren't given the option of the failed bill to say I really first voted for the spending cut amendment, it went down and then I didn't want to go over the cliff and ultimately voted for the senate bill. They usually like to give them a vote for something that fails so they can have an affirmative vote before they vote for the sellout bill that they can't stand. So it is hard to imagine that they would end up in these few hours between what was sort of this revolt to a majority of the majority. It is hard to imagine that it is going be majority of republicans on this. I think they probably found more support than they would have in 2011. But that is a lot of numbers to exceed the democratic vote the. 
>> Bret: What they are doing right now is the roll call. Still on the rule. They will call the actual roll call for every member and as we head to break, we are getting ready for the vote on the big bill and you will see it right here on fox news channel. wildberry is the same frequent heartburn treatment as plosec otc.

>> Bret: Welcome back to washington. Looking live at the house floor and they are getting ready. They just cleared the procedural hurdle the passage of the rule. Let's listen in just for a little bit. 
>> Clear the aisle. 
[Gavel pounding] let the house be in order. For what purpose does the gentleman from michigan. 
>> Mr. Speaker pursuant to house resolution 844 I call up the bill h.R.8 with the senate amendments thereto and I have a motion at the desk. 
>> The clerk will report the title of the bill and designate the senate amendments and designate the motion. 
>> Hr 8 to extend certain tax relief provisions enacted in 2001 and 2003 and to provide for expedited consideration of a bill providing for comprehensive tax reform and for her purposes. Senate amendments. Motion by mr. Camp. 
[Gavel pounding] 
>> pursuant to house resolution 844 the motion shall be debatable for one hour equally divided and controlled by the chair of ways and means. 
>> The chair recognizes the gentleman from michigan, mr. Camp. 
>> I ask unanimous consent that all members have five legislative days in which to advise and extend remarks and include extraneous material. 

[00:46:34]


>> I yield myself such time as I macon psalm. 
>> Gentleman is recognized. 
>> I rise today to urge what a colleague from georgia called a legacy vote. Making permanent the tax cuts republicans enacted back in 2001 and 2003. I couldn't agree more. And let me say why. Because we are making permanent tax policies republicans originally crafted. Now, back then despite having a majority in the house, a majority in the senate and a republican in the white house, those policies were only temporary. That is because democrats refused to join republicans in providing tax relief for working families. After more than a decade of criticizing the tax cuts democrats are finally joining with republicans in making the tax cuts permanent. Republicans and the american people are getting something really important. Permanent tax relief. As big as that s, and it is only the first step when it comes to taxes this legislation settles the level of revenue washington should bring in. Next we need to make the tax code simpler and fairer for families and small businesses. And we need to pursue comprehensive and fundamental tax reform to create the jobs we need and to make american businesses and workers competitive in the global marketplace. Simply put, the tax code is a nightmare. It is too complex. Too time consuming. And too costly. About 60% of individual taxpayers have to hire others to do their tax returns because the code is too complicated. As a result, if tax compliance were an industry it would be one of the largest in the united states and would consume 6.1 billion hours the equivalent of more than 3 million full-time workers. It is too costly. In 2008 alone taxpayers spent $163 billion complying with the individual and corporate income tax rules. Add to that the fact that the u.S. Has the highest corporate tax rate in the o.E.C.D. And an outkated worldwide system of taxation and it is not too difficult to imagine why many don't view america as an attractive place to invest and hire. Nothing about the bill we are considering tonight changes any of those realities. That is why the ways around means committee will pursue comprehensive tax reform in the next congress. So by making republican tax cuts permanent we are one step closer to comprehensive tax reform that will help strengthen our economy and create more and higher pay checks for american workers. I urge my colleagues to support this bill and get us one step closer to tax reform and i reserve the balance of my time. 

[00:49:20]


>> The gentleman's time is reserved. The gentleman from michigan. Mr. Levin. 
>> I yield myself such time as I shall consume. 
>> The gentleman is recognize. 
>> This is a bipartisan bill and I will try to keep it within that spirit to the extent possible. As we are here today on january 1, hours away from people, americans returning to work markets reopening around the world, around the world, and all eyes focusing on whether this institution can govern, this legistion allow os us to get done what we need to get done. This bill is vital for our nation's economic well -being and I want to emphasize for its standing as the world's most important economy. It is vital for 114 million middle class families whose tax cuts are made permanent. It is vital for two million unemployed american workers who need continuation of their insurance while they continue to look fowork.

[00:54:19]


>> Bret: Looking live at the house floor here mckinley, washington, where the house of representatives is now debating the senate-passed bill dealing with the fiscal cliff. Right now talking congressman darryl issa. Let's listen in. 
>> In the last night tore the last two days of a congress to say that two months from now a new congress s going to do what we are not doing here today is not something I can bring myself to do. I would like to vote for this because I do vote for lower taxes. I want americans to have lower taxes. But the other day in conference one of my colleagues pointed out that if in fact you are spending the money you are taxing our future generation. Are taxing $1.2 trillion next year. We are taxing $1.2 trillion. We won't collect it. But we are taxing $1.2 trillion of deficit. The chairman of the committee of the ways and means committee mr. Camp rightfully so said we are also not simplifying the tax code. We are not making it better or fairer. We are not getting rid of the nascar loophole. We are not getting rid of the electric motor scooter low speed lop hole. We are not getting rid of a whole lot of tax things that are here but most importantly we are not taking things that the president himself said he would be for like getting the calculation of change cpi of the consumer price index for social security and federal workforce and pensions right which would in fact reduce the deficit going forward. So because of what we are not doing I cannot believe that this tax cut will in fact be followed with the spending cuts to offset any part of the $4 trillion we are putting on the backs of future generations. So I thank all of you who will vote for it. 
>> Bret: Congressman daryl ice issa saying he will not vote for the legislation. Joining me now, the portfolio manager at capitalist pig .Com. Jonathan, the asian markets have opened. They have been open for a news and looks like they are seeing tentative gains with potentially looking at this deal up about 1% at this point. Your thoughts on the market reaction to all of this in washington? 

[00:56:43]


>> Well, it is a little early to know he just yet. Last the markets worldwide just opening after the new year's holidays. Our own markets aren't open yet. So far tentative. The u.S. Dollar is down and gold is up. My opinion is that markets in general will be happy to see any resolution to what has been a serious debacle going on for weeks. Unfortunately, it doesn't address as many of the previous speakers have talked about the underlying core issues here. This is a problem of spending in which spending is not addresseat all. In fact, it is increased as darryl issa pointed out. Many of the loopholes for nasa and green energy remains. Taxes for the biggest wealthiest producers go up as well. Hard to find that longer term markets will find anything to cheer about in what should have been a spending cut didn't happen in the bill. 
>> Bret: I want to listen in to nancy pelosi who is on the floor now. 
>> It was legislation that he helped negotiate working with the republican and democratic leaders in the united states senate. It was a remarkable accomplishment because as we all know while we share the same goals we sometimes have different paths to achieving them and reconciling our differences was a monumental task especially with the time growing short. So we appreciate the leadership -- we appreciate the leadership of the vice president. We appreciate the leadership of the republican and democratic leaders in the senate. And we thank speaker boehner for bringing this legislation to the floor. Hopefully we can duplicate the strong bipartisan vote that the legislation received in the united states senate. And why is that important? Is important because the american -- 
>> Bret: Minority leader nancy pelosi thanking the speaker for bringing the bill to the floor. Jonathan, a minute here before the top of the hour. Your concern, the market's concern about the long-term debt situation really this debt ceiling debate over the next six weeks that s where we could be seeing some real impact. 

[00:59:02]


>> Absolutely, bret. I think it is just a point, i mean although many legislators have said that this puts some certainty into addressing our economic troubles. In fact it doesn't at all. As you pointed out, the debt ceiling debate is up for review. So that is when you can real le start to see a lot of the bigger players not only in stocks but also bonds the ones who are lending the u.S. Government all this money really start to take its toll and we have question investors are reluctant to invest when things are done on a last minute ad hoc basis as has been the case for this congress. 
>> Bret: As more markets open around the world we would like to get your thoughts as we continue our coverage of the fiscal cliff legislation on the house floor live here on fox news channel. And nancy pelosi speaking on the house floor. Stick around. 
>>> They want us to strengthen the middle class.

=======================================================

>> You mentioned vice president biden swooping in at the last minute like superman and being able to secure this deal and that's certainly the perception a lot of people had. WE HEARD mitch McConnell speaking on the floor and he said this shouldn't have taken this long. Certainly, there have been discussions about this for months. So in terms of the political drama thas playing out behind the scenes, how did this happen this waif? All of the sudden, at the 11th hour, well passed the 11th hour, we're voting at two in the morning on this measure. 
>> Well, just as the way things happen in congress. Nobody does anything until their back is completely against the wall. And I've got to say, maura, it's not all said and done for all the reasons we've outlined. The house of representatives still has to act. There could yet be some hiccups if not major explosions along the way here. But, you know, I mean, in order for people to come together, they've really got to have their backs up against the wall. And if you can say one thing, one remarkable thing about what's happening here on the senate floor this evening, and that is there is an overwhelming vote, and, you know, a lot of people thought we would never see this, to vote for tax hikes to repeal -- even the wealthiest and those making over $400,000 a year. Republicans are upset that the revenues that they -- I'm sorry, the spending cuts that they have insisted on all along, some of the reforms to medicare, social security, reductions in spending there, have had to go by the board. Some democrats are angry that the debt ceiling has not been -- this fight over the debt ceiling that's not going to take place until two months has not been taken out of the equation. It is a remarkable site. Nonetheless, with the caveat it may not be over yet. 
>> We've heard that he reached out to harry reid and nancy pelosi and he spoke with them about everything that was going to take place tonight. What else do we know with how he responded to what's happening? 

[00:02:07]


>> Well, it's interesting. The president chose today to have one of those campgn-style events with ordinary americans in the white house and an auditorium in the white house compound today. The president st of came out in a jovial, joking matter. He painted a picture of a deal that was all but done, but he got in a lot of jabs, subtle and otherwise, at republicans and really angered folks. john McCain said he didn't know whether he was sad or angered by what the president had said. Cooler heads have obviously prevailed here. And we do know that the president had been on the phone working this, even though joe biden was sort of the front man, flying point, if you will. And negotiations with mitch McCONNELL. So, sure, the president has been very involved. He, you know, he has led this campaign style effort to try to force republicans' hand. Again, many of those folks are a little bit disappointed that that threshold was allowed to rise in these negotiations. But he did back republicans into a corner here to an extent that they're voting now on a tax hike that many thought they would never vote in favor of. 
>> I hate to look at the next fight before we conclude the one that we're in now, but since you mentioned the debt ceiling earlier and what we're facing in the next couple of months, what are we looking ahead to? What's the next struggle that we're going to see here? 
>> Folks are familiar with the debt ceiling. The debt in this country is $1 trillion and growing. We hit that debt limb. The treasure secretary says they can move some things around and buy us a couple of more months which happens to be the same time that congress is going to have to once again decide how they're going to defer the draconian spending cuts that was decided the last time we voted on the debt ceiling. So all of this time is going to come together and you add one more thing to it and that is the appropriations bill, the spending bill. It expires in march. So you have these three things happening in march. It's just going to lead to another grand bargain, drama-style negotiation and whether or not they come with if comprehensive bill to reform some of the entitlement programs, to reduce government spending, to simplify the tax code, all of the things we heard them talk about our political leaders in washington over the last year and a half. That will be the next chance they have to do that to come together, if you will. To either fight or come together in the grand bargain style agreement. But joe biden tonight, telling democrats behind closed doors when he met with them here on capital hill, he expects a donnie brook when he expects those things to pass. 

[00:05:31]


>> We will keep an eye on everything that's happening with this and on the debt ceiling. Thanks for coming on the phone late with me on new year's eve. I hope you had a good one. Again, to repeat the breaking news here, the senate has voted to approve a bipartisan compromise on the fiscal cliff. We'll have more on that tomorrow. Now, back to "hardball" previously in progress. 
>> Wealthiest americans including to a george washington university poll. 60% say yes, they should. On the question of immigration, the country is not as divided as people may think. Ron, on all of these fronts, people seem to be taking a tolerant view of people in trouble and no a particularly happy view of people with money that they feel have gotten off scot-free. I think that's a generalization. 
>> Well, indeed. It's actually one percent that doesn't represent the majority of the country. % Of the people, they're not going to say yeah, i really hate that. I really feel sorry for those very rich people. Who are going to have to pay a little bit more out of their pocket. But the fight goes on politically in washington, of course, in terms of taxes and budget and everything else. The assault on the welfare state continues. The right wing may give up on gay marriage and things like that, but they're not going to give up on tearing medicare and social security apart and privatizing them. 
>> I think there's a lot of americans who would like to get rid of all of the welfare programs we have. 
>> And the whole notion that comes from the right of big government, and there are times when you have a president, like obama, who makes the argument that we need government to come together and invest in innovation, and health care and the public accepts that. That's a fight. 

[00:07:45]


>> Anyway, on afghanistan, an issue close to my heart, the american public is sick of it. Ron, the question is 11 years and there's still 35% of the country that wants to stabilize afghanistan. I think the british and soviets are still trying to do that. It's not going to get done. 
>> No, it's not. But it is remarkable that the country has become, I would think, decidedly less pro-war than it was a decade or so ago. We have these grinding wars that have done really nothing for the safety of the country. And were illegitimate to begin with. So the country is really sick of war. We're war-weary. We don't want to be sending young people off to some central asian hot spot anymore to just spend a decade there, what? Building a nation in afghanistan? Is that really what we're going to? 
>> If you want to talk about the good news of the past year, you had romney really embracing the neo-con view. YOU HAD john McCain at the republican convention talk about six, seven, eight wars that were ready to roll off the shelves if romney got elected. They are war-weary. I think they're skeptical about wars. I think they looked at that and they didn't fall for it. This election was not decided on foreign policy, but romney tried real hard to say barack obama was weak and didn't know anything about national security and the american public didn't fall for that neo-con bait. 
>> The only way to get his kid in uniform is to photo shop. He wasn't exactly mr. Military, anyway. Thank you, david corn and happy new year. Coming up, the best of campaign 1, think of this as a football highlight show after the big game. 47%. The first debate, we'll go over all the hits and misses with some very smart observers. And we have the annual list of the most notable quotes of the year. The list is full of bloopers like legitimate rape and etch-a-sketch. Here's one from rush, democrats manipulated the weather forecast in tampa so that the republicans would cancel the first day of their convention. And at's not the nuttiest. Let me finish on whether we thought this was a good year for america. This is "hardball," the place for politics. 

[00:13:46]


>>> It's time for the "hardball" 
campaign 2012: The now infamous call to donors. We had 20 republican debates. It was absolutely nuts. And then the tone was set early. The august 2011 debate when they were assembled on stage, showed their intransigence on taxes. Let's listen. 
>> Say you had a deal. 10-1, as byron said. Speaker, you're already shaking your head. But who, on this stage, would walk away from that deal? When you raise your hand if you just feel so strongly about not raising taxes, you'd walk away on the 10 to 1 deal. 
>> Joining ne right now to review that list of greatness, former rnc chairman michael steele who never had a year like this. Seriously, both msnbc contributors. That was a scene where you come from the roots of the republican party, sir. Was that a good day or a bad day? 
>> I think it was a bad day and it's very interesting that later on, huntsman said, you know, i probably should have raised my hand and said I would have taken the 10 to 1 deal. I think he recognized after the fact that that was a definitive moment where he could have carved out a new space on that page and probably run the campaign free of that baggage. 
>> Jou know the politics, you never get blamed for it. Or else vote for the bill when it fails. 

[00:15:58]


>> He began to lock himself into a position of rover norquisting himself for the whole election. 
>> It's today's politics. It's like they used to say they have to be the most segregation in the south. You can never be an inch away for it. 
>> I guess you can say that whatever an early primary season crowd claps for furiously is going to kill you in october 15th in ohio. That's exact what happened. 
>> It's these moments that you bring up in me. Iowa is another unique state out there in the caucuses. Mitt romney was in a mission to annihilate all the ads. Just bomb the hell out of the city. Newt gingrich was the biggest threat. They destroyed him. Here's a romney-supporting ad destroying newt. 
>> Know what makes barack obama happy? Newt gingrich's backage. 1.6 million. Gingrich not only teamed up with nancy pelosi on global warming, but together, they co-sponsored a bill that gave $60 million a year to china's brutal one-child policy. 
>> I don't thinkhey work in presidential elections in october. But those ads out there -- tell me? 
>> Primaries, they are deadly. Particularly in republican primaries. That is particular for newt gingrich was devastating. It hit -- it was the kitchen sink. It threw it all in there. 
>> What did it say in there that you didn't like? 
>> It said he's an insider, he's a washington pal. And, look, he even pals around with nancy pelosi. Didn't we just fire her? 

[00:18:06]


>> Didn't y see those loving looks? 
>> You know, real quick on that. The interesng thing, if I were to pivot off of that caption of him and nancy together because that's what the people are looking for. That partnership working, getting things done. 
>> But they were talking about global warming. 
>> The other thing about that ad, that was symbolic of the entire mitt romney campaign strategy in the primaries. Which was a take-no-prisoners attack policy. It just showed that mitt romney had tons of money and some very clever consultants who could carve up anybody in his path. That left him with a lot of making up to do once he secured the nomination. The way he got the nomination is typified by that ad showed weakness in this camp. 
>> Let's go back to the strategy, which it was. Somebody is going to be the republican nominee and that person is going to be obama. Therefore, all you have to be is there. 
>> And as he just noted and as neil sodacca made famous, making up is hard to do. The reality came for mitt romney, once he secured that nomination in early spring, it just wasn't there. 
>> Throughout the republican primary, mitt romney pushed himself so far to the right. It was nearly impossible. And, by the way, I don't think he even tried one. It became a defining line on the hard right for romney. Let's listen. 
>> Governor romney, there's one thing I'm confused about. You say you don't want to go and round up people and deport them. But you say they would have to go back to their own country and apply for citizenship. So how do you send them home. 
>> The answer is self deportation. People decide that they can do better by going home. So we're not going to round people up. 

[00:20:07]


>> So what was wrong with that? 
>> First of all, the phrase, self deportation managed to summarize everything that people didn't like about mitt romney. 
>> You know, like firing you. 
>> The firing part of it in the sort of cold, technocratic part of it. These are just numbers on a spread sheet. I think the combination of the two, the cold hardedness and the cold-bloodedness just played into everybody's view. 
>> It's just not realistic. Your grand pop is going to wake up tomorrow saying mitt romney said I should self deport. I'm getting out of here. 
>> This was funny. I hope it didn't ruin the guy's life because it was so funny. Many thought he'd win this thing until some lackluster debate gave primary voters second thoughts. And then came this moment, NOVEMBER 9th, BIG DEBATE. Let's watch. 
>> I will tell you, it's three agencies of government when i get there that are gone. And what's the third one there? Let's see. Oh, five, okay. So commerce, education a the -- 
>> epa? 
>> Epa. There you go. 
>> Siersly? Is epa the one you were talking about? 
>> No, sir. No, sir. We were talking about the agencies of government -- the epa needs to berebuilt. No doubt about that. 
>> But you can't name the third one? 
>> The third division of government -- 
>> commerce? 
>> Commerce. And let's see. I can't, the third one, I can't. Sorry. 

[00:22:15]


>> He must have got a whole lot of help from his pals here. That's why they came out. You can't bring notes with you? They start scribbling the notes when they get out there. Howard, I've never heard oops before in the national debate. 
>> Up next, the most outrageous conspiracy theories. This is "hardball," the place for poll sicks. Ring. Progresso. Your soups are so awesomely delicious my husband and I can't stop eating 'em! What's...that... on your head? Can curlers! Tomato Basil, Potato with bacon... we've got a lot of empty cans. 
[ Male Announcer ] Progresso. You gotta taste this soup. 

[00:25:55]


>>> Back to "hardball." The final weeks of president obama's first term are upon us. It's hard to remember the many bizarre conspiracy theories pushed about the president the last four years. Let's look back at some of the worst first. President obama's 2010 trip to india. Others on the right were up in arms over rue nors about what the trip would cost. 
>> I think we know that just within a day or so, the president of the united states will be taking a trip over to india that is expected to cost the taxpayers $200 million a day. We have never seen a trip at this level before at this level of excess. And I think it's not a good signal to send to the american people when the american people are, quite frankly, struggling right now with high job losses. 200 million a day would have surpassed the daily cost of the war in afghanistan at the time. It was started by an unnamed source on an indian news web site. We can't talk about conspiracy theories without bringing up rush limbaugh. This past august was cancelled due to hurricane isaac. 
>> You've got a hurricane coming. The national hurricane center, which is a government agency, very hopeful that the hurricane gets near tampa. The national hurricane center is obama. It's a national weather service, part of the commerce department. It's obama. I can see obama sending fema in advance of the hurricane hitting tampa. So that the republican convention is nothing but a bunch of tents in tampa. A BUNCH OF RVs AND STUFF. Make it look like a disaster area before the hurricane even gets there. 
>> Did you ever think rush limbaugh would warn us of a skewed weather report? Float the idea of a tax increase in his state. Well, it's about the need to beef up the military personnel in case civil war breaks out in case president obama got elected. Here's jung herks edd on that one. 

[00:28:17]


>> I'm thinking worst-case scenario. Civil unrest, civil disobedience, civil war, maybe. We're not talking just a few riots here and demonstrations. We're talking lexington, concord, take-up-arms and get rid of the guy. The sheriff, I said are you going to back me? He said yeah, I'll back you. 
>> That was his idea of the worst-case-scenario. Here's iowa u.S. Congressman steve king with how president obama's mother managed to convince us all that her son was born in hawaii, not in kenya. 
>> I looked into that before he was sworn intohe presidency. We look sbood the library of congress and we found the microfiche of two newspapers, only two newspapers in hawaii. Each of them had published the birth of barack obama. That doesn't mean that there aren't some other explanations on how they might have announced that telegram from kenya. The list goes on. I guess she considered herself naming her son might be a minor setback for her son's future run for presidency. Up next, mitt romney's 47% video to obama's debate disaster in november. You're watching "hardball," the place for politics. 

[00:34:05]


>>> Welcome back to "hardball." First up, the video that turned out to be the low-point for the romney campaign. The candidates taped comments to donors down in florida that nearly half the americans are lazy and happy to be on the government doll. It's simply known as the 47% video. Let's listen again. 
>> There are 47% of the people who will vote for the president no matter what. There are 47% of the people who are with him who believe that they're entitled health care, to food, to housing, to you name it. So my job is not to worry about those -- I'll say they should take personal responsibility and care for their lives. 
>> Never trust the caterers. Let's take a look at the 47%. It seems to be one of the things, if you're right about this election, it's the numbers. First of all, they occupy people, 1%, all of the second-degreen, 1% became the thing to talk about. And then the 47% being anybody who's on any kind of benefit program, whether it's disability or retirement or military or pension. Everything was painted as bad. Where did he get that number. 
>> Look, this election was all about the numbers. 23 million unemployed, one in six on welfare. It was that 47% number that trumped them all at the end of the day. People galvanized them because it was me. It really drew out that disconnect between the romney campaign and everyone else. 
>> Do you really think it's his brand of ideology? That there's a few people out there pulling the load for everybody else? 

[00:36:05]


>> I disagree. I think it's his philosophy and I think it showed in that tape. 
>> How do you think it's his philosophy? You can't say it's his philosophy because he never told us what that was. 
>> I think he said some nice things about it. 
>> When you spoke at the democratic national convention, former president bill clinton brought the house down. This was one of the greatest speeches ever, I think. Let's listen to big bill at his best. 
>> Are we better off than we were when he took office? Listen to this. When president barack obama took office, the economy was in free fall, it had just shrunk to 9% gdp. We were losing 750,000 jobs are month. Are we doing better than that today? The answer is yes. 
>> The whole dynamism. 
>> Earlier this year, I wrote oh, who needs conventions. What are they for, anyway? They're for moments like that. I was on the floor for that moment. And it was one of the most memorable things I've seen live in a hall or anywhere. That was bill clinton at the summation of his career. That was everything he had learned about showmanship, about telling a story. And about how to make a case for the president. He made it so sitly, so clearly, so logically. You wonder why barack obama couldn't do it. And that's probably because the kind of case he had to make, somebody other than the president had to make. If the president himself says, you know, we were in a terrible situation when I came in, it doesn't sound as compelling when somebody else said it. 

[00:38:13]


>> I had a moment like that up in new hampshire when clinton was running the first time. He had all the problems with that girlfriend way back when. That was all behind him. And th he went out in front of these field houses and high school gyms and he spoke on the last question he would answer. He said to me noble in our generation can do that. Only he can do that. 
>> What also impressed me about that, I was covering that very same series of events was his will. Bill clinton's will to succeed. 
>> Anyway, another turning point that threatened to derail this campaign. And this is purely negative. It was a pretty good day for mitt romney. The president's listless performance in that first presidential debate which he says caused me to have a stroke averwards. Here's part of his closing argument, if you want to call it that, an aent. 
>> You know, four years ago i said that I'm not a perfect man and I wouldn't be a perfect president. But I also promised that I'd fight every single day on behalf of the american people and all of those struggling to get in the middle class. If you vote for me, I'mmise I'll fight just as hard in the second term. 
>> I think a lot of it had to do with how he feels personally about mitt romney. The idea that he was just on the stage with him was beneath him. This guy was someplace else. Yeah, yeah, it was his anniversary. Politically, he was thinking why I dealing with tier 2. And it showed. 

[00:40:23]


>> Right before it, we saw a democrat facing a really tough situation along with a pretty popular governor of new jersey. Here he is with the press conference witthe new jersey governor, chris christie. 
>> We are not going to tolerate red tape. We are not going to te bureaucracy. I've instituted a 15-minute rule, essentially, on my team. You return everybody's phone call within 15 minutes. If they need something, we figure out a way to say yes. It just keeps getting worse and worsz. I think it was just two people of different parties. 
>> The republicans and the democrats, conservatives and liberals coming together. 
>> Why do you think that bipartisan spirit seems to be stronger now? Why is that there? 
>> I think that was there. And I think to chris christie's credit, he galvanized the moment through action. But you saw a cooperation. You saw his government and the federal government coming together. 
>> They were wearing the fleece. 
>> Exactly. You had the fleece on, the sleeves rolled up. 
>> You guys are the best. I have to tell you, I love politics. I'm breaking the story here. 
>> There's certain things when people rise to the occasion and do the right thing. Anyway, thank you, michael. 
>>> Up next, from etch-a-sketch to legitimate rate to 47%. University has the list of the most notable political quotes of the year. This is "hardball," the place for politics. ring... Progresso This reduced sodium soup says it may help lower cholesterol, how does it work? You just have to eat it as part of your heart healthy diet. Step 1. Eat the soup. All those veggies and beans, that's what may help lower your cholesterol and -- Well that's easy 

[00:42:43]


[ Male Announcer ] Progresso. You gotta taste this soup. 

[00:46:07]


>>> We're back. 2012 is coming to a close. But, before it does, let's look back at a few of the most memorable quotes. Quotations that were uttered this year. Everything from the historic to the infamous to, of course, the absurd. For the seventh year, fred shapiro has released his list of the top ten quotes. Joining me right now is jonathan alder and ken voger. Gentleman, your starting gates, here they come. Romney had been pushed to the far right on a host of issues. And the question many were asking was could he pivot back to the center in the general election. And then one of his top advisors said this. Let's watch. He hit a reset button and everything changes. It's almost like an etch-a-sketch where you can shake it up and start all over again. 
>> Here's our secret plan for the general election. We're going to pretend we're moderates and he did. They didn't pivot to the center until that first debate many months later. So what that etch-a-sketch comment did, it almost cost them the election right there. It prevented them from scampering back to the ish shoe. It didn't allow romney the running room he needed. 
>> I also say I don't believe a word that I spoke since running for president. Here's one for you, ken. If one crystallized the overwhelm trouble, it was this. Take a look at number 6. 
>> First of all, from what i understand from doctors, that's really rare. If it's a legitimate rape, the female body has ways of shutting that whole thing down.

>> Let's start with the first part. If it's a legitimate rape? What did that mean? 
>> What it meant was absolutely unjustifiable. And it was the reason, the potential for todd aiken to go off the reservation and prepare to hit him on. It shows why democrats wanted him to be the nominee to the point where they advertise democratic super pacts in his primary for the republican nomination to run against claire McCASKELL TO SAY TODD AKEN IS Too conservative. He is opposed to abortion. Hey, this sounds like our kind of guy. 
>> You know, canadian mounted police like this say we always get our man. AND claire McCasken got her man to run against. Anyway, the president bounced back from a bad first debate. He was a memorable line from the third debate from the memorable quote of the year. You mentioned the navy, for example and that we had fewer ships than we did in 1916. Well, governor, we also have fewer horses and bayonets. The nature of our military changed. We have these things called aircraft carriers where planes land on them. We have these ships that go underwater, called nuclear submarines. 
>> The most memorable moment occurred in this second debate. 
>> I any it's interesting the president just said on the day after the itack, he went in the rose garden and said this was an act of terror. Is that what you're saying? 

[00:50:27]


>> Please proceed, governor. 
>> There's so much to that phrase. Please proceed. What was that? Was it the good wife? What was that? It was a corn scene, I think. 
>> He just led him right into the track and that was very harmful. It basically took foreign policy off the table. It made it seem like, in the third debate, romney barely showed up because he had basically seeded all of foreign policy to the president. That's what the polls were showing. It's something you very rarely see in a debate, chris, w is a clean kill. Two or three other examples. This is a perfect one where romney was very well-prepared and taken by his staff to a place that he shouldn't have been, where he's trying to score points on an issue where he shouldn't have been trying to score. Romney said obama did fot use that words. The moderator actually stepped in at the time and fact-checked him and said you're wrong. And that was just so devastating. 
>> Yeah, well said. It was critical. He's right, john. Twitter sbantly went wild. It's the number two line of the year. Let's take a listen. 
>> We took a concerted efrlt to go out and find women who had backgrounds who could find members of our cabinet. 
>> So what was the quote of the year? This probably won't shock you. In some ways, it defined what the election was all about. Let's watch. 

[00:52:52]


>> Agree, john? Agree, ken? This is the line that put him away? 
>> Not only was this unbelievably devicive in a country that likes to think of itself as one country. But it was kritically important that it was caught on serp tishs video. Now I'm seeing the real mitt romney. Not the one in the packaging. Television r it was like the true mitt romney in this setting,just so illustrative of what people's worst preconceptions of what mitt romney was. 
>> The worst thing that can happen to you in a criminal trial is just to hear the voice of your client on tape. There's something about caught on tape, ever since nixon, i don't know. You don't want to be caught on tape. Merry christmas. Happy new year, both of you guys. When we return, let me finish with my thoughts on the year that was. You're watching "hardball," the place for politics. ?????? ?????? 
[ Female Announcer ] HE COULD BE THE ONE. Soulmate. Husband. Loving father to your children. But first you've got to get him to say, "hello." New crest 3d white arctic fresh toothpaste. Use it with these 3d white products, and whiten your teeth in just 2 days. What will a 3d white smile do for you? New crest 3d white toothpaste. Life opens up when you do. 

[00:57:44]


>>> Let me in tonight end the year with this. A reasonable judgment about american 2012 is that we are a more diverse people than some imagined. We are a country more tolerant of our diversity than i imagined. Was it a good year for america? My answer is yes. As a country, we backed the rights of women, increasingly backed the rights of gay people. Not just in life and liberty, but the pursuit of happiness. We were very open to words in the declaration of independence. I never believed president barack obama had a second term in the bag. I thought he was on his way out of town. His vice president out-battled his rival. The president came back to show he was not a man to be taken down twice. Most important, he got some breaks. The supreme court upheld health care. Mitt romney showed himself a man at home but his fellow, rich, outn a limb when trying to be someone he isn't. A right wing simpleton. So we look forward to a new year, a second administration of a significantly ogressive president. It is on balance a centerist country that has rejected versions of policies it holds responsible. It likes its president. It roots for success and believes strongly that american will win again because of its deep resilience. We can change. We are changing. When we see failure, we find it hard to change. I learn that people are only truly paying attention to what they discover for themselves. We learned what must be done because we saw what was being done to our children and grandchildren if we didn't. We gave up cigarettes which gave us pleasure because we discovered the damage that they can do. We should be able to give up semi-automatic rifles. And that's "hardball" for now.

[00:04:16]


>> I could see his eyes were open, he was not moving. Lauren got a surge of superhuman strength. She lifted the 3,000-pound car off her dad, amazingly. She pulled him out but when she checked his pulse, the situation was grim.

>> Reporter: It's the most important dress a woman will ever wear, her bridal gown. 
>> It feels very special. 
>> Reporter: Candyce thought she had found her dream wedding dress when she fell in love with this designer dress by justin alexander. But at $4,000, it was way out of her range. 

[00:06:24]


>> It was my dream wedding dress. 
>> Reporter: That's before she found the same dress at a boutique. 
>> Here it was for me to order right then $300. 
>> Reporter: But when the dress arrived candyce was shocked. 
>> I was horrified because this isn't the dress they showed on the picture. It was the most hideous dress i had ever seen. 
>> Reporter: It was a poorly made knock off. 
>> Well it looks so awful. It looks like I'm wearing a white trash bag. 
>> The material of the counter fit dress is thin and cheap. And that's not all. 
>> This is the type of beading I was supposed to have on this dress. This is what I got cheap sequence. 
>> Reporter: And only weeks away from her wedding. 
>> I was in the brink of canceling my wedding. 
>> Reporter: Hundreds of brides say they have been misled by these websites that use the designers pictures to advertise the knock off. We decided to order this, it's one of the most popular gowns in the country and sells for about $4,000. But we paid half the cost. A month later, our wedding gown arrived. But it wasn't from the designer. It was from china. 
>> It feels like tissue paper. This is not the designer label. What's this? 
>> Reporter: And that's not all we got. 
>> Oh, no, this is believe it or not is the veil, it looked like mosquito netting. We put the real gown next to the guess we found online and called in an expert to take a look.

>> Reporter: Randy peneri is from the tv show, say yes to the dress. 
>> When you order this from maggie sotero you're going to get a really dramatic beautiful train on this dress. 
>> What a big difference. Look at that. 

[00:08:26]


>> It's a huge difference. 
>> Reporter: The beading on the counter fit looks nothing like the real dress. 
>> You're going to see glass crystals, glass cut beads and this is beautifully done and if you look over here at this one. What you're going to see are a lot of big plastic silver sequence. 
>> Reporter: Just like the counter fit dress candyce received. 
>> I would be horrified to see someone walking down the aisle, let alone myself in this. 
>> Reporter: Fortunately her friends pitched in and bought her a new gown. 
>> All my friends rallied together and said we will buy your dress, any dress in the store. 
>> Reporter: On her wedding dress, candyce says she felt like every bride should, beautiful. 
>> By the way candyce did try to return that gown to get her money back but she couldn't. And we tried to contact the website that told us those counter fit gowns. But they didn't respond to our request either. 
>>> Now the teenager who died on christmas day one year ago. But the 18-year-old left behind some heartwarming videos hoping to inspire others. Now we have the untold story. 
>> Reporter: He's the courageous 18-year-old with the fatal heart condition who shared messages of hope with the world.

>> Today is a celebration of the joy that ben brought to our lives. 
>> Reporter: More than 1,500 people attended a memorial service for ben breedlove a time for hugs and tears and memories of a boy who lived a short life but who's words will live forever -- but whose words will live forever.

>> Plus a song a day every day and she sings 

[00:14:20]


>>> it's the house for sale that perhaps no one will ever call home. All because of the serial killer who once lived there. It looks like any ordinary 1950s RANCH STYLE HOME. There are three bedrooms, 2-1/2 baths and a large dining room. The home near akron ohio is up for sale for $329,000. But for some, it's a tough sell. Because this was once the home of one of the most notorious serial killers of all time, jeffrey dommer. 
>> Some rs are shocked. 
>> Reporter: Jeffrey dommer first move into the house when he was 8 years old and it's here that he killed his first victim in 1978. The gruesome ordeal was seen in the movie dommer. 
>> I had fantasies about picking up a hitchhiker and taking him back to the house and having complete control and dominance over him. And the one week when the house was empty, that that was the week when I saw the first victim. 
>> Reporter: So who could live here? For the last seven years musician chris butler has called it home but he admits when he heard dommer was a former resident he was freaked out. 
>> Of course I was just, you know didn't stop shaking for about 24 hours. 
>> Reporter: The house sits on an acre and a half of lush green woods with a pond and walking trail. 
>> The house won me over by its beauty and serenity. 
>> Reporter: The nearly 2,200 home gets lots of light and even comes with a greenhouse. Real estate agent greg grecco gave us a tour. 
>> This room is the living room with a fireplace. We also have a library here as well. 
>> Reporter: The house was built in 1952, the style of the home was so innovative that it was actually featured in a photo spread in the akron beacon journal. The kitchen has updated stainless steel appliances and granite counter tops. But with all these upgrade it's past is hard for many to ignore. 

[00:16:33]


>> The house didn't kill anybody. 
>>> Jeffrey dommer was killed by another inmate while in prison in 1994. 
>>> It was a crime spree that happened throughout the country, crafty thieves stole millions from casinos. But how did they pull off the scam with surveillance cameras catching every move. We go behind the scenes to look at the secrets. 
>> Reporter: You're watching a casino heist in action. Inside edition has acquired surveillance pictures. It's almost like a theme from the movie the hang over where this character seems to know what cards are coming up next. 
>> Yes, come on. He can't lose. He can't lose. 
>> Reporter: And these real life card sharks did know the exact order of the cards because the dealer stacked the deck. But their luck was about to change when the cheats walked into the sequan casino outside of san diego. The scam can be difficult to detect even with surveillance monitors recording all the details. The casinos head of security who asked that his face not appear on camera took us into the top secret monitoring room where cameras capture all the action. He shows us how the dealers stack the deck with a false shuffle keeping the cards in the exact order. Watch closely, see that ace of spades. The dealer pretends to shuffle the card but doesn't really mix them together. 
>> That ace is still right on top. 
>> Reporter: The key to pulling off this scam is controlling the bets which is why all of the players and even the dealer are all in on it. This guy standing right behind the dealer is key to the scam. He looks like he's smoking a cigarette but he's actually talking into a hidden microphone up his sleeve. He reads out the cards being played. When the cards come up again after the fake shuffle. The cigarette guy signal it is players when the bet and when to fold. But this is when these thieves overplay their hand. See that special red card, it's a card that is used.

>> The dealer pulls the card and -- 
>> do it again. 
>> You messed up. You put it right in the middle of the deck I set up for you guys.

Mason: All rise! This court is now in session. The honorable judge alex ferrer presiding. 

[00:02:03]


Judge Alex: Thank you. Please be seated. Miss cunningham, you're suing your former tenant miss hubbard for back rent that you claim she owes you. 
-Is that correct? 
-Cunningham: Yes. 
Judge Alex: Okay. And, miss hubbard, you say that you don't owe her any back rent, because you were evicted when the property was being foreclosed on. In fact, you're counterclaiming because you say that she falsely put under your name some bills that weren't your responsibility... 
Hubbard: Yes, sir. 
Judge Alex: ...And for harassment, as well. All right, miss cunningham, so, tell me how you came across miss hubbard. Cunningham: I ran an ad in the paper, but she has friends that were living in one of my two-family flats, and the -- and the -- and the friend gave her my phone number. And she called me and she wanted to move in on taylor street. Taylor street is a -- is a two-family flat. It's about 1,700 square feet. It's three bedrooms. It's huge and it's beautiful. It's, uh -- 
Judge Alex: Are you trying to do, like, an advertisement to rent it again now? 
Cunningham: No, no, no, but it's -- it's a beautiful -- no, it's really -- it's -- it's a -- it's a big place. 
Judge Alex: Miss hubbard, what about taylor street? Was that a good unit? 
Hubbard: Well, it was a good unit at first. 
Judge Alex: Okay, well, before we get to that, you had a friend who was living in that area? 
Hubbard: Yes. 
Judge Alex: Another tenant of miss -- of miss cunningham's? Hubbard: Yes, that also moved on her. 
Judge Alex: Okay, but when that tenant talked to you, she encourage you to come move? Hubbard: She said -- yeah, she's like, "well, I know --" I told her I was looking for something bigger, because, at the time, I had three -- four children. And I told her I was looking for some bigger property than what I was in, 'cause I was in a one-bedroom. And she was like, "well, my landlord -- "she got some properties. "You know, talk to her. She might give you this property." 
-Judge Alex: Okay. 
-Hubbard: And I saw one of her properties on taylor street, and I liked it. It was a nice 2 1/2-bedroom, and I was like, "okay, it's big enough." 
Judge Alex: So, what was the arrangement? She was gonna pay you... 
Cunningham: She was gonna pay me $500 a month. 
Judge Alex: Uh-huh. 
Cunningham: She was gonna osit, which she did not pay. She started out paying -- she paid $700. I have a receipt here. She paid $700 down. What she did was, she lived on taylor street, and two blocks away, I have a two-family flat on gladstone. She had friends that live upstairs. She has five children. She's a con artist, your honor. Let me tell you. 

[00:04:15]


Hubbard: A con artist? 
Cunningham: She's a con artist. Hubbard: She's a con artist, your honor, and I got the proof. 
Judge Alex: Okay. I'll come there. One second. 
Cunningham: "I'm on welfare." "I got a job, and I do hair." Okay? And I felt sorry for her because she had five children living in a one-bedroom, and this place is a lot bigger, so I let her move in it. So, she put sympathy on my heart because I care about people. I've been doing this since 1977. And so I thought she was a nice person, and I let her move in my property, and she tore my property up. 
Judge Alex: Okay, so, she moves in to the taylor property, and she's paying you -- supposed to pay you $500 a month. 
Cunningham: Right. Judge Alex: Does she pay you $500 a month? 
-Cunningham: No. 
-Judge Alex: Okay. Well, when does she fall behind? 
Cunningham: She was never -- she was never current. She was never current. I have the list. E was never current. Judge Alex: Let me see your list. And from day one, she was behind? So, did you enter into some other arrangement with her? 
Cunningham: Yeah. I felt sorry for her because she always came up with a good excuse. Judge Alex: I know, I got you. I heard that. She put compassion on your heart. So, what was the arrangement you entered into? 
Cunningham: Okay, she paid me like $200 every two weeks. 200, $250, $300. 
Judge Alex: Miss hubbard, so, you move in to taylor street. Supposed to pay her $500 security deposit, $500 rent. You said you don't pay it at the outset completely, but you catch up eventually. But when you get there, she says you fall behind immediately on the rent. And my question was, did your circumstances change or something? Hubbard: I paid her for taylor. I paid her every two weeks for taylor. And when I got behind, I paid her with my taxes completely, sir. Judge Alex: The lease was $500 a month. And it was supposed to pay $500 at one time, at the beginning of the month. And you guys changed it to, "pay me every couple of weeks." So, why did you change it to pay her every couple of weeks? Hubbard: Because how I get paid. I get paid twice a month, and that's why. Judge Alex: So, you moved in thinking you'd give the $500 up front, but you realized, since you get paid every two weeks, it's a little hard to do that. She accommodated you and said, "okay, pay me every couple of weeks." 
-And you did that. 
-Hubbard: Yes. 
Judge Alex: How long did she live in the taylor apartment? Cunningham: She lived there a year. 
Judge Alex: Okay, and so any -- are there any other problems with her, other than the fact that she's behind on the rent? 

[00:06:21]


-Cunningham: No. 
-Judge Alex: Okay. Any problems with her, other than the fact that you couldn't stay current on the rent? Hubbard: Yes, there was major problems. Not for taylor, but for gladstone street. 
Judge Alex: I'm sorry? No, I'm talking about taylor. 
Hubbard: Oh. Oh, no, there wasn't any problem. 
Judge Alex: So, everything was fine at taylor? 
Hubbard: Everything was excellent, wonderful. 
Judge Alex: You should have stayed at taylor. Hubbard: But I -- see, I got pregnant. This is where the misunderstanding is. I have -- I have five total now. Judge Alex: So you had four kids? You're a single mom? 
Hubbard: Yes, I am. Judge Alex: Why do you want five? 
Hubbard: I believe, if you lay in your bed, you should lie in it. 
Judge Alex: Okay. 
Hubbard: That's -- I mean, you know what I'm saying, right? 
Cunningham: But as long as the welfare system can take care of you having babies, you continue to have babies. 
Hubbard: I've been at my job for four years. I take care of my children, sir. 
Announcer: Coming up, can schehear keep her story straight? 
Judge Alex: "Instead of getting out of there, I just stop paying rent"? 
Hubbard: No, I was -- no, I still -- I was still paying her what I could. Judge Alex: So it wasn't about the bedbugs. It was that you didn't have the money to pay rent. 
Hubbard: No, it wasn't about that I didn't have money, 'cause I was working. It was about the simple fact that I was, like, iffy about the house being on foreclosure. That's why I moved, sir. 
Announcer: And later, the mystery of the missing family pet is revealed. 
Judge Alex: She says, when she got to the apartment, you had left the dog behind in the dead of winter. And here, I'm looking at a picture in february or whatever it is. You're clearly already gone, because your furniture is out in the front yard. And enjoying your mattress is your dog. Announcer: back with t the case of brenda cunningham, who's suing her former tenant schehear hubbard for $3,196 in unpaid rent. Schehear hubbard claims the house was in foreclosure and infested with bedbugs, and therefore, she doesn't owe miss cunningham any back rent. She's countersuing for $4,000, claiming miss cunningham ran up an electric bill in her name. 

[00:10:40]


Judge Alex: So, let's get to apartment number 2. Now, apartment number 2 is the gladstone property. 
-Cunningham: Right. 
-Judge Alex: Okay. So, how were you paying your rent? 
Hubbard: I was paying her with my work check -- paying her, you know, money order and whatever. Judge Alex: Okay, so, let me see the receipts for your money orders. Let me see the stubs you have for all the payments. 
Hubbard: I -- I don't have all the payments. I just have the last ones I gave her before I moved out. 
Judge Alex: You're holding up two payments? 
Hubbard: Yes. 
Judge Alex: But you lived with her at the taylor apartment for a year and a half or so, right? 
Cunningham: Yes. 
Judge Alex: And then you lived at the other place for like seven months? Hubbard: Um, I moved there in -- Judge Alex: July to january? 
Hubbard: No, I didn't move there in january. I got evicted, which I have the eviction papers right here. I got evicted on the 29th of december. Judge Alex: Okay, all right. Let me -- let me -- let me see the receipts you have. What do you have? 
Hubbard: I have the receipts for the last one I paid her. 
Judge Alex: Okay. So, you move in to the gladstone property. You're living there for about six, seven months. You're -- are you making those payments every month? Hubbard: Yes, I was, until october, which is the last receipt, because I got some letters in the mail, which a man came to my door and taped this piece of paper on my door, and -- Judge Alex: Let me see what you have. Mason, would you bring that up? 
Hubbard: He taped these papers to my door, and I called her about them. And I say, "hey, you know, this house supposed to be in foreclosure, miss cunningham." She told me at the time that it wasn't supposed to be in foreclosure. I also have another piece of paper saying it went in foreclosure. So I say, "hey, well, you know, I'm not --" Judge Alex: Okay, so, you got a notice in -- Hubbard: And, plus, the bedbugs. I'm not gonna pay her for them bedbugs. She didn't even tell me about that. Look at my arm. My kids got ate up -- ate up. Judge Alex: What are you showing me, ma'am? 
Hubbard: These marks right here, them little dark marks. 
Judge Alex: Come on back up here. Come on up here. So, you're telling me that the apartment on gladstone had bedbugs? 
Hubbard: Yes. These are -- all them little dark marks right here, sir, are bedbug bites -- all of them. 
Judge Alex: Hold on, hold on, don't go turning your arm. Those don't look like bedbug bites. 
Hubbard: No, they -- they old 'cause it been months ago. No, these are burn marks from my job. I'm talking about the dark marks that you see that's covered -- like, those are bedbug bites, sir. 
Judge Alex: They don't look like bedbug bites. 
Hubbard: Okay. Judge Alex: First of all -- Cunningham: Because they're not. 
-Hubbard: Yes, they was. 

[00:12:40]


-Judge Alex: Okay, first of all, I don't know why you have so many scars on your arms, but -- but this is what you're asking me to believe, okay? You want -- what you're telling me is, "when I was staying at the gladstone property, "it was full of bedbugs -- so much that they were biting me and my children." Hubbard: Yes, they were. 
Judge Alex: But instead of getting out of there -- 
Hubbard: I told her. She told me that she -- 
Judge Alex: "Instead of getting out of there, I just stop paying rent"? 
Hubbard: No, I was -- no, I still -- I was still paying her what I could. 
Judge Alex: So it wasn't about the bedbugs. It was that you didn't have the money to pay rent. 
Hubbard: No, it wasn't about that I didn't have money, 'cause I was working. It was about the simple fact that I was, like, iffy about the house being on foreclosure. That's why I moved, sir. Judge Alex: This is what you gave me, okay? What you gave me says that the house -- there's a foreclosure -- judicial foreclosure hearing that will occur in february. Now, this is october. So, what was the plan? Was the plan, "i gonna live here rent-free until february 'cause I got this letter"? 
Hubbard: Unh-unh, no. Judge Alex: So, why does -- why does this have to do with anything? If she's gonna lose the property, she's gonna lose the property. If you want to get out, get out. But what I don't agree with is, "oh, she's got a problem with the bank/ so I get to stay here rent-free." If you stay, you pay. 
Announcer: Coming up, will this landlord-tenant dispute get flushed down the drain? 
Hubbard: The seat she had put on there was terrible. It was nasty, so I bought a seat from the dollar store, which was that plastic seat. 
Judge Alex: You bought a dollar-store toilet seat? 
Hubbard: You know, that's what I can afford, sir. 
Judge Alex: It's time for america to vote on today's case. Who do you think I'm going to rule for -- the plaintiff... 
Cunningham: She was gonna pay me $500 a month. 
Judge Alex: Uh-huh. 
Cunningham: She was gonna pay $500 in security deposit, which she did not pay. Judge Alex: ...Or the defendant? Hubbard: I -- I paid her for taylor. I paid her every two weeks for taylor. And when I got behind, I paid her with my taxes completely.

[00:26:14]


-Cunningham: That's the dog. 
-Hubbard: That's charlie! Judge Alex: That's your dog? 
Hubbard: Yeah. 
Cunningham: That's february the 15th when I took that picture. Judge Alex: Is this your furniture? 
Hubbard: Yeah, that was the furniture, yes. I left -- I left the couches behind 'cause they was filthy. 
Judge Alex: You just left him out in her yard?

Judge Alex: You left the furniture in the house? 
Hubbard: I left the furniture in the house because they had bedbugs. I'm not taking that with me. Judge Alex: This was your furniture? 
Hubbard: The couch and the dresser was, yes. 
Judge Alex: So, she says, when she got to the apartment, you had left the dog behind in the dead of winter. And here, I'm looking at a picture in february or whatever it is. You're clearly already gone, because your furniture is out in the front yard. And enjoying your mattress is your dog. Hubbard: I know. I was looking for him. They told me she called the humane society. 
Judge Alex: Well, did the humane society bring her back? 
Hubbard: No, they told me that she called the humane society. I thought that my dog was gone. Judge Alex: You left your dog behind. Hubbard: I didn't leave charlie behind. Judge Alex: How did he get there? 
Hubbard: I have no idea. 
[ Laughter ] 
Judge Alex: No, what do you mean, you have no idea?! 
[ Audience groans ] are you kidding me? Look, you didn't -- what you didn't know -- what you had no idea was, you did not know that she had a picture of your dog left behind. You left your dog behind in the winter -- in the dead of winter in detroit, in a house that you left to fend for himself. Hubbard: I wouldn't leave my dog. 
Cunningham: This is how she manipulates people. 
Judge Alex: No, I got it. This is not my first time, okay? This is -- this is not the first rodeo I've been at. 
[ Light laughter ] all right, so, let's -- let's take a look at what you have here. Unpaid rent -- $3,126. Okay? Do have any proof at all that you paid rent, other than your receipt for 2 out of the 20 months or 25 months you were there? 
Hubbard: I wish I did have my receipts, but I paid her. But, your honor, why would I be there that long and not paying her? I would have been evicted. 
Judge Alex: Because people do it all the time, miss hubbard. I get tenants who come in here and are used to milking the system, where they will stay there and they will -- they know how long they can stay without being evicted. They come in, they go, "oh, I got bedbugs. I wasn't gonna pay rent for living with bedbugs." And I go, "you stayed, you got to pay." "Well, it wasn't the bedbugs, it wasn't the bedbugs. "It was these documents I got. The place was under foreclosure." I go, "well, it wasn't gonna be under foreclosure till february, so why did you stop paying in october?" "Well, it wasn't this. That wasn't it. "I just fell behind, but I only owed $200. "And by the way, she reported my dog to the humane society. "I would not be the kind of person "who would leave my dog back to fend for itself "in an apartment in the dead of winter in detroit. That's not what I do." Lo and behold, charlie's using your mattress. 

[00:28:40]


[ Laughter ] that's what happens. Okay? So, bottom line is, you owe her $3,195, which includes the court costs -- $3,196, which includes the court costs. Now, you're suing her on a counterclaim for your gas and electricity because when you moved out, she went and found out there was like $3,000 in gas and electricity that has not been paid to the company. And so she gave the company a copy of your lease. You were renting the property, and you were responsible for the gas and electricity. So there are no damages. You were responsible for whatever the bill was on that property. So it's $3,196 for the plaintiff, zero on your counterclaim. 
-Good day. 
-Cunningham: Thank you. 
Mason: All rise! 
Announcer: Judge alex has ruled in favor of the plaintiff and has ordered the defendant to pay her $3,196. The judge has denied the defendant's counterclaim. 
Cunningham: I'm very happy with the judge's decision. He could see through her that she was a manipulator and a big liar. I am very happy with his decision. And I think that he did a great job, and you could see that she was disappointed and angry, and she ran out the door.

E knowledgeable about cars? 
Lex: Well, I race motorcycles professionally. Judge Alex: How long you been doing that? 
Lex: I've been doing it for six years. 
-Judge Alex: Since you were 10? 
-Lex: Yes. 
Announcer: But was his need for speed too much? 
Judge Alex: What happens after you buy the car? 
Lex: We were driving in that car along a street near my house. And all of a sudden, it started sounding funny. And I knew what certain sounds meant 'cause I had broken a lot of engines racing. 
Judge Alex: "The problem is internal in engine, "or oil pump is damaged, and also no oil coming to the valve train into the cylinder head." This is a massive problem. 
Announcer: Today, judge alex races to get to what really happened. Judge Alex: So what is your theory as to how this happened within 24 hours? Trexler: I've never had anything happen with the oil pressure before. 
Judge Alex: You ever have it lose compression? 
Trexler: No. 
Judge Alex: You're a 16-year-old who races motorcycles. Why shouldn't I believe that you got this sports car and took your friends for a very fast ride in it and damaged the car? 
Announcer: As a cop, he stood up for the law. As a trial lawyer, he fought for the truth. And as a criminal court judge, he commanded authority. Now he returns to preside over america's courtroom. 
--Captions by VITAC-- www.vitac.com Barbara hartl and her son, alexander "lex" hartl, are suing anthony trexler for $9,194 because they claim he sold them a car that broke down the day after they bought it. They want a refund on the price of the car. Anthony trexler says the car was in perfect working order when it left his property and lex is at fault for the damages. He says he owes the plaintiffs nothing. 
Mason: All rise! This court is now in session. The honorable judge alex ferrer presiding. 
Judge Alex: Thank you. Please be seated. Okay, ms. Hartl, you and your son are here suing mr. Trexler because you say he sold your son a car that broke down a day later. 

[00:02:04]


-Right? 
-Barbara: Yeah. 
Judge Alex: Mr. Trexler, you say you're not at fault. He's the one who broke the car after he took possession of it by racing it, so you're not liable for the damages. 
-Trexler: Correct. 
-Judge Alex: Okay. All right, lex, tell me what's going on here. 
Lex: So, basically, I'd been looking for a car in a price range between $5,000 to $10,000 for -- 
Judge Alex: How old are you, if you don't mind me asking? 
Lex: I was 16 when I started looking for the car. I'm 17 now. Ay. What kind of car were you looking for? 
Lex: I was looking for a front-engine, rear-wheel drive car. I like the german cars a lot. I was a big fan of those. 
Judge Alex: You're a little knowledgeable about cars? 
Lex: Well, I race motorcycles professionally. 
-Judge Alex: Really? 
-Lex: Yeah. 
Judge Alex: Are we talking about motocross or -- 
Lex: Road race bikes. 
Judge Alex: Road race bikes? 
Lex: Like grand prix bikes, like bikes for asphalt. 
Judge Alex: How long have you been doing that? 
Lex: I've been doing it for six years. 
-Mason: Wow. 
-Judge Alex: Since you were 10? 
Lex: Yes. Judge Alex: So, have you won awards? 
-Lex: Yes, your honor. 
-Judge Alex: You have? 
Lex: Yeah, with wera west, I won the 125 gp championship and the formula one championship. 
Judge Alex: I have no idea what that means, but it sounds impressive. 
[ Laughter ] so, obviously, you know about engines, the mechanics of engines and things like that. So, how do you come across mr. Trexler? 
Lex: I came across mr. Trexler from a craigslist post. So, I just basically googled e36, which is the numbers of the vin from a 1990 to 1999 3-series bmw. 
Judge Alex: [ Laughs ] this just kills me. So, you don't even -- you don't even google the model, which was a -- which model was it? Lex: It was a 1990 bmw m3. 
Judge Alex: Okay, so you don't even google "1999 bmw m3." You google the code in the vehicle identification number to find the car you want. 'Cause that's gonna give you more specifics? That particular model has these particular options and all of this. 

[00:04:06]


Lex: Yes. 
Judge Alex: Okay, so, mr. Trexler, why were you -- by the way, do you have a picture of this vehicle? 
Lex: Yes, I do. 
Judge Alex: All right, let me take a look at it. Mason, if you don't mind? 
Judge Alex: Mr. Trexler, tell me about the car. What's going on? 
Trexler: I've had the car for about eight years, your honor. It was my baby. I took very good care of it. I have all the service records. Judge Alex: Let me put the picture up here so we can see the car we're talking about. That's not a bad starter car for a 16-year-old. Bmw m3 this 28-year-old man has been babying and has been taking care of, and that's your starter? I really hate my parents at this point. 
[ Laughter ] so, what happened? So, did you get contacted by mr. Hartl here -- 
Trexler: Yeah, he was actually the third guy to want to test drive the car. 
-Judge Alex: How did it run? 
-Trexler: Ran great. You know, it had hiccups, but I took care of 'em. 
Judge Alex: Okay, what do you mean, "it had hiccups"? 
Trexler: Back in -- hold on, let me -- Judge Alex: What are you looking at? 
Trexler: I'm looking at the service records here from -- Judge Alex: Let me see the service records. That'll be quicker. Are those all the repairs you've done to the car, or just some? Trexler: This is the majority. The major work that I had done to it was $13,000. I replaced the engine head because a head gasket blew. A head gasket is basically, like, a $2 part that requires hours and hours of labor to get to. And they were, like, "if you're gonna spend all this money to replace the head gasket, why not just replace the head?" I'm, like, "yeah, that sounds great." We did a suspension job on it at the time. It was my baby, and I wanted to take care of her as much as I possibly could. 
Judge Alex: Okay. You are a mechanic's dream. I'm looking at your bills here. Trexler: They're a high-maintenance car. Judge Alex: Okay, I understand that, but what do you do for a living? 
-Trexler: I'm a bartender. 
-Judge Alex: You must be the highest-paid bartender in california. 
Trexler: [ Laughs ] 
Judge Alex: I'm serious. Look at this. These bills, okay. One bill -- $2,812. Then you take it in for another repair -- $867. Another repair -- $844. Then the famous $13,000 repair. Do you supplement your bartending income by, like, selling heroin? 

[00:06:22]


[ Laughter ] 
Announcer: Coming up, what's the mechanics behind the breakdown? 
Trexler: I have letters from both mechanics saying the car was in good order when it was sold, and that it was most likely abused. Judge Alex: What does your mechanic think he did in 24 hours? 
Trexler: I don't know. I have his statement right here. 
Announcer: And later, as the judge drives deeper and deeper into the case, what red flag is waved? Judge Alex: This I find disturbing. Announcer: back with the case of barbara hartl and her son, lex hartl, who are suing anthony trexler for a $9,194 refund because, they say, he sold them a shoddy car, which broke down the day after it was in their possession. But anthony trexler says he doesn't owe the plaintiffs anything, because lex is the one who ruined the car by racing it. He says the car was in perfect condition when it left his property. Judge Alex: You talked to mr. Hartl, and how does it go? Trexler: He test-drove the car. I think it was, like, two days later, he contacted me and was like, "what are you doing today? I want to buy the car." I was like, "oh, okay." 

[00:09:43]


Judge Alex: Did you ever talk to his mom? 
Trexler: Yeah, right before I went to go sell him the car, the mechanic that we went to -- it was like a mutual mechanic. Like, he found it, and it was right by my house. So, the mechanic was out to lunch, so I went and grabbed lunch, and his mom called me while I was at lunch, and we spoke briefly on the phone. Judge Alex: Okay, so that was it? 
-You never met his mom? 
-Trexler: No. 
Judge Alex: So, you sold the car to him, not to his mom. And tell me about the mechanic. First of all, what were you asking for the car? 
Trexler: I was asking $8,000 at the time. Originally, $9,950, but, you know, after a month of having it be on craigslist and all that kind of stuff -- 
Judge Alex: Okay, so, tell me about the mechanic. What did you do? 
Lex: So, basically, I called him. The day after, actually, I test-drove it. It was the next day. Me and my friend -- a friend of mine -- drove up in my mom's car. We went there. After the mechanic looked at it, he told us that the car would need a new clutch, and he told us about how much that was gonna cost, and then he told us that it would need two rear axles, and he told us about how much that would cost, too. 
Judge Alex: So, you take the car to a mechanic. He checks it out. He tells you, good deal. You go, and you buy the car. What happens after you buy the car? 
Lex: The next day, me and my -- I mean, a different friend -- were driving in that car along a street near my house. And all of a sudden, it started sounding funny. And I knew what certain sounds meant 'cause I had broken a lot of engines racing, 'cause those engines were made to only run a couple of races, then break. And so, I immediately pulled over right away, as soon as I heard the sound. I called my mom asked her to pick me up, and she picked me up. 
Judge Alex: You had the car checked out, I assume? What did the mechanic say? 
Lex: The mechanic said that the car -- 
Judge Alex: You have a statement or anything? 
Barbara: Yes. 
Judge Alex: Let me see what the mechanic says, please. Thank you. You have that happen to you while you owned the car, mr. Trexler? 
Trexler: Have I had the car run rough before? Yes. I don't know what he was experiencing, so I can't say, "yes, I've had this happen before," 'cause it could be a completely different problem with the car. 
Judge Alex: Uh-huh, so, the mechanic says, "engine stalls while driving in shift into second gear, "also made noise. "Check -- tested the oil pressure with gauge, "oil pressure switch. Found no oil pressure. "Removed the oil filter, found no oil coming to filter. "Problem is internal in engine or oil pump is damaged, "and also no oil coming to the valve train into the cylinder head." This is a massive problem. So what is your theory as to how this happened within 24 hours? Trexler: I've never had anything happen with the oil pressure before. 

[00:12:08]


Judge Alex: You ever have it lose compression? 
Trexler: No. I have letters from both mechanics saying the car was in good order when it was sold, and that it was most likely abused. Judge Alex: So, what does your mechanic think he did in 24 hours? 
Trexler: I don't know. I have his statement right here. And then I have the statement of the mechanic that we took it to together. 
Judge Alex: Okay, let's see what happened. All right. Here's the mechanic you took it to, who says, "they brought it for a pre-buy inspection. "At the time of the inspection, we found no engine problems, "namely any problem with oil getting to the engine. "Said car was in good condition. "We recommended to the seller that the car be purchased based upon the inspection." Okay, and the guy who works on your car, is that the other -- 
Trexler: Yeah, he's the owner of the place. Judge Alex: Okay, he says, you... "Diligently maintained his 1999 bmw m3 with us "until he recently sold it. "It was in excellent mechanical health. "If the new owner is having difficulty with his vehicle, "i can confidently say it's moskely from abuse or not being familiar with the manual transmission." Okay, so here's the question, mr. Hartl. You're a 16-year-old who races motorcycles. Why shouldn't I believe that you got this sports car and took your friends for a very fast ride in it and damaged the car? 
Lex: There's a lot of cops where I live, your honor. They're everywhere. 
Judge Alex: In other words, "i'm a careful driver and would never do that" was not the first answer that came to your mind. 
[ Laughter ] the first answer that came to your mind is, "there's a lot of cops, so I can't get away with it." Trexler: He actually got a ticket on the way to come pick up the car, and that's why he was running a few minutes late. 
Announcer: Coming up next, did anthony purposely hold back key information about the car? 
Barbara: I asked anthony if he had the service records. He said he did, and that he e-mailed them to lex. 
Lex: I didn't get that service record until after I bought the car. 
Barbara: The mechanic never saw any of the service records. 
Judge Alex: It's time for america to vote on today's case. Who do you think I'm going to rule for -- the plaintiffs... 

[00:14:13]


Lex: All of a sudden, it started sounding funny, and I knew what certain sounds meant 'cause I had broken a lot of engines racing. Judge Alex: ...Or the defendant?

Let the Making Begin Announcer: "Judge alex" returns with the case of barbara hartl and her son, lex hartl, who are suing anthony trexler for $9,194 because, they say, they bought a car from him that broke down the day after they purchased it. They believe anthony knew the car was a lemon. And therefore, they want their money back. But anthony denies their claim and says lex is at fault for the damages because he raced the car. Judge Alex: This I find disturbing. In january, before you sell it to him, right? Six months before, you took it to your mechanic who wrote the statement for you -- and by the way, I totally get why he wrote a good statement for you. You probably put his kids through college with all the repairs you did at his shop. 

[00:18:28]


[ Laughter ] "customer states car runs poorly -- advise. "Work performed -- recommend and replace cylinders 3 and 4, "ignition coils. "Additionally replace all spark plugs. Advise customer dme..." That's the car computer, right? "...Recorded mechanical over-rev OF 8,200 RPMs. "Car has low compression due to over-rev. "Advise customer car likely has a bent valve. "Recommend removal of cylinder head "for further diagnosis. The customer declined at this time." The car computer said you over-revved the car to 8,500, 8,400. 
Trexler: They mentioned that to me, and I was like, "i honestly have no idea when the car would have even done that." They were, like, "did you down shift?" Judge Alex: Here's the problem, mr. Trexler. 
-The problem is you -- 
-Lex: The computer wouldn't lie. 
Judge Alex: The problem is that you have a car that, while in your possession, gets over-revved to the point that your mechanic says, "that's the reason you have low compression." When you over-rev a car, the engine overheats. You can throw a rod. You can damage the head, which is where I thought you were going. You can mess up a lot of things on it. Trexler: I replaced the coils and all the spark plugs and everything. And I was like, "if the car runs rough after that, "then I got to take it back in, "and we got to do the bent valve thing and see if that's the problem." 
Judge Alex: So, what happened after you made that repair? 
Trexler: The car never had another engine problem. 
Judge Alex: When you test-drove it, it seemed fine? 
Lex: When I test-drove it, it seemerfect. 
Barbara: I was supposed to have talked to the mechanic while they were there because I had asked anthony, on the phone -- he said, "i'll meet you at the mechanic." I said, "i can't go there "'cause my daughter's in a dance recital, but I want to talk to the mechanic." I asked anthony if he had the service records. He said he did and that he e-mailed them to lex. The mechanic never saw any of the service records until after this whole thing, so they went to the mechanic. 
Judge Alex: Well, you know, the mechanic is gonna check out the car and see what's obvious. He's not a psychic. He's not gonna find everything that's possibly wrong with the car. 
Barbara: In his statement, he said had he seen that service record, where the customer declined to have the diagnostic done, he would not have recommended the car. He would have recommended that lex pay less than half. 

[00:20:28]


Lex: I didn't get that service record until after I bought the car. He didn't e-mail me the full set of -- he showed me the first -- the service record that said that he had done that whole head job and all the head gasket. 
Trexler: The only service record that I showed him was -- it had nothiine head. It was to show him that the speaker that was blown in the car had been purchased, and that I will mail it to him. 
Announcer: Coming up, what does barbara say that gets judge alex all revved up? 
Judge Alex: Who goes and sends their 16-year-old son to buy a sports car, $8,000, and sits at home making pancakes, or whatever you're doing? You should have been with your son.

Judge Alex: It's time for america to vote on today's case. Who do you think I'm going to rule for -- the plaintiffs...

We'll see you there. Announcer: back with the case of barbara hartl and her son, lex hartl, who are suing anthony trexler for $9,194 because, they say, he sold them a car that broke down the day after they bought it. But anthony trexler says the car was in pristine condition when it left his property and the plaintiffs are at fault for the car breaking down. 
Judge Alex: Typically, in a transaction between private individuals, unless there's something expressly stated, it's an as-is transaction. That's the way it goes, okay? Unless you're dealing with a dealership and things like that, okay? But that's not the bottom line. The bottom line, mr. Trexler, is you sold a car to a 16-year-old boy. 16-year-olds cannot legally contract. It varies from state to state, but in california, a contract with a minor is voidable. He has until the time he turns 18 to void that contract. He's 17 now. So the bottom line is, I can't prove fraud on his part. 

[00:25:17]


-I don't -- you can't prove -- 
-Barbara: Can I -- 
-can I say something? 
-Judge Alex: No, shh. 
Barbara: I don't want to use the word "fraud," but I think there was a deliberate attempt to mislead. And mislead me because I don't know a lot about cars at all, so when anthony called me -- Judge Alex: But when you're buying a car -- by the way, mislead you? You weren't even there. Who goes and sends their 16-year-old son to buy a sports car, $8,000, and sits at home making pancakes, or whatever you're doing? You should have been with your son. 
[ Applause ] his claim is supported by the records. He does find a claim of a low compression problem with the engine. The guy does repair. He even brings it back for a separate repair later. The car is clearly still running. He drives it for four additional months. You take it to your mechanic. Your mechanic checks it, and you want to blame him for not disclosing everything? Well, guess what. Salespeople don't disclose everything. That is why you take the steps you took. The one step you didn't take was going with him, okay? Now, I'm not sure it would have made a difference, but what I am sure is, I'm not gonna listen to you complain here today that he should have disclosed other things when you weren't even there to ask the questions thatoncern you now. Unfortunately, I can't award you your full claim because this court has a maximum allowable claim of $5,000. The bottom line is, upon your request, I'm voiding the contract as judgment for the plaintiff in the amount of $5,000. Title goes back to the defendant. 
Mason: All rise! 
Announcer: Judge alex has ruled in favor of the plaintiffs and has ordered the defendant to pay them $5,000. The judge has ordered the title of the car be returned to the defendant. 
Lex: I felt the judge's sion to rule "void the contract" was a good decision on his part. I definitely learned to make sure that I have my mom with me next time I buy a car. Trexler: I think it's great. It's kind of, like, somewhere in the middle of what either side was talking about. You know, I can sleep at night not feeling like the bad guy that, like, this kid doesn't have a car now. And, you know, he has the $5,000 to hopefully go out and get a new one, and I hope he does 'cause I think he is a great kid. Mr. McClendon, do you understand why she fusses at you? Do you get it? Because you're half ridiculous all the time.

>> This makes her third, your honor. She gave the second baby she just had up for an adoption. 
>> Judge Brown: You're not fit to be a parent. You know you've been acting bad... Bad... Bad! 
>> Announcer: Ooh! Bad girls you love to hate, today on "judge joe brown." 
>> Jeanne: Caring for a friend's child comes with some expensive strings attached. Plaintiff andrea volbert is suing a former family friend for back child support. Defendant melissa latterell is countersuing for basic-care necessities. Now it's "joe" time. 
>> Judge Brown: Let's see. Ms. Volbert, you are suing ms. Latterell? 
>> Latterell, yes. 
>> Judge Brown: And you're claiming that she owes you for child support she received that she was not entitled to. Is that right? 
>> Yes. 
>> Judge Brown: You deny that, and you actually have a counlaim saying that for the first year of this arrangement, you had to furnish basically the entire suite of the child's fundamental needs. 
>> That's right. 
>> Judge Brown: Clothes, all expenses, medication, and whatever else that maybe she didn't furnish anything. And you weren't getting child support from her. You were getting it from the state. Is that right? 
>> No, the first year and a half, I was not getting it from the state. I was getting nothing from anybody. 
>> Judge Brown: Nobody. You just did it out of the goodness of your heart. 
>> That is correct, judge joe brown. 
>> Judge Brown: Then, you started getting it sent to you as an allotment from the state. Is that right? 
>> Right. It was a court order. I was taken to a court order, and they -- 
>> Judge Brown: The court -- that's what I thought. The court ordered a certain amount sent to you. 
>> That is correct. 
>> Judge Brown: All right. You first. 
>> Well, my daughter moved back in with me in july of 2011. And I took full responsibilities then.

>> She was 4 at the time. 
>> Judge Brown: Let's see. That's your 7-year-old. So, you would have been what, 14? 
>> I was 15. 
>> Judge Brown:15. That's three-some years ago. 
>> Yes. 
>> Judge Brown: Well, why didn't the defendant get any compensation for keeping your daughter for this year and a half? Why? 
>> Because she told me she didn't want it. I was an active part of my daughter's life while she lived with the latterells for a really long time. 
>> Judge Brown: Well, why so long? 
>> Why was she there so long? 
>> Judge Brown: Since you just left her there, and there was no court order requiring it. 
>> Judge Brown: Where I was living was unsuitable for any child to live. 
>> Judge Brown: This is your new boyfriend, who's here as your witness? 
>> Yes. 
>> Judge Brown: Now, winds up, everybody goes to court. There's a court order essentially appointing the defendant as a foster parent. And what happens is, they order a certain amount of support to be paid for her. Now, you took the child back. 
>> I did not take the child back. 
>> Judge Brown: Well, then, why do you say in your complaint that your daughter moved back home in july with you, and defendant continued to be sent child-support payments by the statuntil march? 
>> They voluntarily gave me my daughter back because it was going that way in court. 
>> That's not true, your honor. 
>> Judge Brown: Stop interrupting. 
>> We had a guardian ad litem, and her recommendations were consisting of me getting my daughter back because -- 
>> Judge Brown: Well, where is the written order of the probate court approving that recommendation? 
>> I don't have that. 
>> Judge Brown: Your four months pregnant. 

[00:04:03]


>> Yes. 
>> Judge Brown: And this child support that's ordered by the state to go to her. Now, why are you entitled to any of it as a refund to you? 
>> Because I take care of my child by myself, and they were taking money from me. 
>> Judge Brown: Wow-ee-whoopee. The state that you live in, minnesota, awarded child support to her pursuant to their orders. 
>> I have -- 
>> Judge Brown: So, you can't stop that until they order it stopped. So, the order was that the child support was to be paid directly to the defendant. Now, you come by without a court order, and when that child is still supposed to be with the defendant, you take that child home in july, and she collects it till march. And you want to get the child support that was paid, pursuant to that order, to the defendant given to you? 
>> I have a delegation of parental powers that she signed. It's pretty much kind of like temporary custody. 
>> Judge Brown: Did it get approved and ordered by a competent court? 
>> Yes. 
>> Judge Brown: Now, let me hear your counterclaim. 
>> The counterclaim is that until -- 2/16 of 2012, ms. Volbert was still in arrears to me for the child support. That was after the year and a half, and they decided that she should be legally obligated to pay me $292 a month. 
>> Judge Brown: Yeah. See, you're talking about all of this. You didn't read it. She took you in for contempt. You have arrearages, and the court order is that you owe monthly payments to this lady for what you didn't pay her. And then you come in here, and you want a refund of what little part payment she did get? 
>> They took my taxes, and i paid child support -- 
>> Judge Brown: Well, then, why didn't you pay? And the court has said you didn't pay when you could pay. Willful and intentional failure to pay support with the means to do so. So, you had the means to do so, and you had something else to do other than pay the money for the support of your child. The state found that you were in arrearages and ordered that you make payments on the arrearages to the defendant. Now you come back in here and say, "because I violated the court order, I'm entitled to have her pay me something the state ordered sent to her." And because of your status, you were supposed to reimburse the state for part of what the taxpayers were paying for the support of your child that went to the defendant. Now you got another one, and you're already in hock and in contempt of the court's orders because you are further in arrears on the principal child support. 

[00:06:45]


>> This makes her third, your honor. She gave the second baby she just had up for an adoption. 
>> Judge Brown: Oh, really? 
>> Yes. 
>> Judge joe brown, we did -- 
>> Judge Brown: Stand up if you want to talk, but move next to your wife. Look, I'm well aware of what's going on here. 
>> Judge joe brown, we did make contact with the other minor child that andrea had and reunited erin and that child. 
>> Judge Brown: Very good of you. She was too lazy and trifling and unconcerned to do that. 
>> Jeanne: We'll be right back with "judge joe brown." 
>> Judge Brown: Children learn mostly from emulating or copying what they see adults around them do. So, your whole pattern is just tacky. 
>> Jeanne: And later today... 
>> I was riding my bike on a bike path, and I saw her approaching me, and I just kept riding, and the dog -- when i got a little bit past her, the dog bit me. 
>> Judge Brown: Dog on a leash? 
>> Yeah, it was on a leash.

[ Female Announcer ] Pillsbury Cinnamon Rolls. Let the making begin. ?????? ?????? 
>> Announcer: Bad girls you love to hate, today on "judge joe brown." 
>> Jeanne: We're back with "judge joe brown." The defendant in this case says she took care of the plaintiff's daughter when she was deemed unfit. She says the plaintiff wants a refund of child-support payments the defendant says she used to take care of the little girl. Let's see what the judge has to say. 
>> Judge Brown: Put one up for adoption. You abandoned another one to her. You didn't pay for that. You were ordered to make up for it. Now you want to come back in, and you look at your children as cash cows, and you're pregnant with another, and you got two you aren't supporting. And, by the way, it looks like that child is suffering because you just didn't care. 
>> You can look at it another way. 
>> Judge Brown: By the way, you know children learn mostly from emulating or copying what they e adults around them do. So, your whole pattern is just tacky. You come in here and want $3,000 worth of overpayment, when, actually, you are in delinquent status for much more than that? Your complaint's denied summarily off of the documentation from the state. From the point the plaintiff was ordered to pay child support, she is delinquent on those payments, and arrearage on the amount paid has been established. 
>> That's correct. 
>> That's correct, judge joe brown. 
>> Judge Brown: All right. I'll tell you what I'm gonna do. I've looked at your laundry list of what you supplied for the benefit of the child and for that exemplary extending outward. There's no reason for this laggard over here to enjoy the benefit when she repeats the error -- not once, not twice, but three times. 

[00:12:13]


>> I agree. 2,500 and your costs is awarded to the defendant, cross complainants. 
>> Thank you. 
>> Miss Sonia: This courtroom is now in recess. 
>> Jeanne: Childish behavior over child support. The plaintiff can't just pull the plug on what the court has ordered, and it turns out she owes the defendant. Now we're on to the next case. 
>> Miss Sonia: Please raise your right hand. 
>> Jeanne: Assistant editor kijana jones is suing the defendant for medical bills. Defendant kalima candelario says the plaintiff's wound was minor. 
>> Judge Brown: Let's see. Mr. Jones is suing ms. Candelario, and you're alleging that her pit bull bit you while you were riding your bike on a bike path at one of the local beaches here in los angeles. Now, ms. Candelario, you say you don't owe the plaintiff anything because, in your opinion, the wound was very minor, and you say the injury did not require a hospital visit. 
>> Yes, judge joe brown. 
>> Judge Brown: You first, sir. 
>> Well, your honor, I was riding my bike on a bike path, and the defendant -- 
>> Judge Brown: Where were you? 
>> I was in long beach. 
>> Judge Brown: Long beach. 
>> On ocean avenue. And I ride my bike on a bike path. I always ride my bike up there. And I saw her approaching me, and I just kept riding, and the dog -- when I got a little bit past her, the dog bit me. He jumped up on my leg and bit me. 
>> Judge Brown: She was on a bike path? 
>> Yeah, she was walking her dog on a bike path. 
>> Judge Brown: Dog on a leash? 
>> Yeah, it was on a leash. 
[ Chuckles ] 
>> Judge Brown: So, where did you get bitten? 
>> On my ankle right here -- on my left ankle. 
>> Judge Brown: I don't want to see it now. I think you submitted pictures. Did you not? 
>> Yes, I have pictures. And I also have, like, pictures of a sign that says, "no dogs on the bike path." 
>> Judge Brown: Well, that's where you got chomped. 
>> Yes. 

[00:14:13]


>> Judge Brown: I've seen those signs. They're symbols, but, I mean, they're in common usage -- no parking... No fires... No dogs. 
>> And there's also another -- there's a picture that shows where you couldwalk the dogs on ocean avenue. So I can't understand why she would walk her dog on the bike path, where bikes ride past. 
>> Judge Brown: Apparently, you went to the emergency room. 
>> Yes, I had the ambulance to come out and pick me up. 
>> Judge Brown: Ambulance? 
>> Yes. 
>> [ Laughs ] 
>> yes. 
>> Judge Brown: Why ambulance? 
>> Well, because I couldn't get to the hospital. 
>> Judge Brown: Why couldn't you get to the hospital? 
>> Because my leg was hurting. The dog bit me on my leg, and my leg was hurting. 
>> Judge Brown: Yeah, but that's not a debilitating injury. She's right on that. 
>> I was on my bike, your honor. 
>> Judge Brown: Well, the bike wasn't damaged. 
>> Iwas. 
>> Judge Brown: Not that badly. You had some skin broken. You got punctured, but, you know... 
>> It was bleeding. 
>> Judge Brown: Well, that's all right. 
>> [ Laughs ] 
>> it was bleeding. Plus, it was too far for me to ride my bike over there with my leg bleeding, your honor, from the location where I got bitten at. 
>> Judge Brown: You took an ambulance for that? 
>> [ Laughs ] 
>> Jeanne: We'll be back with more "judge joe brown" in a moment. 
>> We're walking along the beach, and he was on his bike, and he was -- 
>> on the bike path. 
>> Which is also a walking path. 
>> On the other side. 
>> Which I was on. 
>> No, you wasn't. 
>> Announcer: It's "joe" time after this. Dawn long... ...but he'd wait for her forever, for any reason, and would always be there with the biggest welcome home. For a love this strong, Dawn only feeds him Iams. Compared to other leading brands, it has 50% more animal protein. ...to help keep Rocky's body as strong as a love that never fades... if he ever lets her leave again. Iams. Keep Love Strong. 

[00:17:48]


>> Jeanne: We're back with "judge joe brown." The plaintiff in this case says he was riding his bike by the beach when a pit bull attacked. He said his leg was bleeding so bad, he had to call an ambulance. Let's see what the judge has to say. 
>> Judge Brown: The report is that the paramedics, when they rived on the scene, gave you rst aid. 
>> Mm-hmm. 
>> Judge Brown: There was nothing immediately life-threatening. I imagine you would have been prudent in getting a tetanus series and antibiotics, perhaps, as a prophylactic to prevent infection... 
>> Mm-hmm. 
>> Judge Brown: ...And ascertain the vaccination and health history of the offending dog. 
>> Well, your honor -- 
>> Judge Brown: But ambulance? 
>> [ Laughs ] 
[ laughter ] he was very overly dramatic about the whole event. 
>> I was bitten by a vicious animal. 
[ Laughter ] 
>> not vicious. 
>> So, I was -- I was frightened by the dog. 
>> Judge Brown: Now, didn't you used to be the cameraman on an animal-related -- acameraman on an animal-related reality show? 
>> Yes. 
>> Oh, wow. [ Laughs ] 
>> Judge Brown: So, your exposure to the animals -- wouldn't that kind of inure you to going through a blind panic or, "oh, my god, I'll bleed to death before I get to a medical facility"? And the paramedics come on a 911 call, and they bandage your leg. At that point, what you do is go home, go to your personal physician or a clinic, get a tetanus shot. So, you went to the emergency room. 
>> Yes, I was. I got a tetanus shot. They gave me a tetanus shot. 
>> Judge Brown: What'd you do with your bike? 

[00:19:49]


>> I was picked up from the hospital. 
>> Judge Brown: Well, where did the bike go? The bike go with you on the ambulance? 
>> Yeah, yeah, they put it on the ambulance. 
[ Laughter ] they put it on the ambulance. 
>> Judge Brown: Okay, let's go to the defendant. 
>> Okay. I was walking on the beach with my daughter, my niece, and my sister. And we were walking my dog, which is ni??a. She's about 2 years old, and she's a pocket pit bull. So, she's a very small breed. 
>> Judge Brown: She's not a big one. 
>> No, she's a small breed. 
>> But vicious. 
>> She's not vicious. The poor dog is afraid to go up the stairs at my house. 
>> Your honor -- 
>> we're walking along the beach, and he was on his bike. And he was -- 
>> on a bike path. 
>> Which is also a walking path. 
>> On the other side. 
>> Which I was on. 
>> No, you wasn't. 
>> Judge Brown: Well, the point of the exercise is, he was where he was entd to be. You were entitled to be there, but what about that sign? 
>> Well, actually, I had never been up to the long beach to walk her before. I normally take her on walks through signal hill, which there's a lot of people, a lot of bikes. No one ever has an issue with her. She doesn't even bark. And we were -- 
>> she bites instead. 
>> We were walking, and he actually was on the bike path. 
>> Judge Brown: Maybe she smelled fear. 
>> Right. 
[ Laughter ] and he was actually a little too close, and she reacted, I guess, and she nipped at him. Now, had she lock-jawed on him, he would have gotten injured. But it was a superficial wound. Even the paramedics that came, the lifeguard -- 
>> Judge Brown: Fascinating. But, by the way, you haven't given me a defense yet. 
>> No. 
>> Judge Brown: Well, let's put it this way. You are taking it out of the category of vicious animal. 
>> Yes. She's not a vicious animal. 
>> Judge Brown: No, but the animal reacted to somebody being in your space. But now that gets right back to you. 

[00:21:52]


>> Yes. 
>> Judge Brown: No dogs allowed on that particular pathway, leash or otherwise. 
>> They just got signs all up and down there saying that. 
>> They have signs, but the entrance that I came in from the beach was all the way down at the end. 
>> Judge Brown: You entered at the wrong part of the pathway and didn't see them. 
>> Jeanne: Judge joe brown makes his ruling after this. 
>> Judge joe brown. 
>> Judge joe. 
>> Judge joe brown. 
>> Don't tell me I was punked. 
>> Judge Brown: [ Laughing ] things happen! 
>> Oh, my goodness. 
>> Judge Brown: Wait a minute. 
>> [ Laughs ] 
>> Judge Brown: I'm enjoying myself. It's entertainment. 
[ Echoing ] IT'S ENTERTAINMENT. 
>> It's all his fault. 
>> Judge Brown: Why? 
>> Announcer: Closed captioning for "judge joe brown" sponsored by... ] me? Healthy joints and vv new move free. It helps my body maintain and repair up to 38% more cartilage. Healthy joints move free. lisa, quit. I honestly loved smoking, and I honestly didn't think I would ever quit. 
[ Male Announcer ] ALONG WITH SUPPORT, Chantix is proven to help people quit smoking. It reduces the urge to smoke. It put me at ease that you could smoke on the first week. 
[ Male Announcer ] SOME PEOPLE HAD CHANGES In behavior, thinking or mood, hostility, agitation, depressed mood and suicidal thoughts or actions while taking or after stopping chantix. If you notice any of these stop taking chantix and call your doctor right away. Tell your doctor about any history of depression or other mental health problems, which could get worse while taking chantix. Don't take chantix if you've had a serious allergic or skin reaction to it. If you develop these stop taking chantix and see your doctor right away as some can be life-threatening. If you have a history of heart or blood vessel problems, tell your doctor if you have new or worse symptoms. Get medical help right away if you have symptoms of a heart attack. Use caution when driving or operating machinery. Common side effects include nausea, trouble sleeping and unusual dreams. With chantix and with the support system orked. It worked for me.

[ Male Announcer ] ASK YOUR DOCTOR IF CHANTIX Is right for you. 

[00:26:57]


>> Judge Brown: Now, I'm not worried about a man having a permanently scarred ankle. If you get around, you're gonna have scars anyway. Ambulance bill? No. So I'm gonna knock $650 off of this. That's like somebody decided they were gonna get a limo to the emergency room, and that's way overdoing it. So, what I will allow is $1,628 and your costs. 
>> Miss Sonia: This courtroom is now in recess. 
>> Jeanne: Land shark? No, it was a pocket pit bull at the beach, but it did take a bite out of the plaintiff's leg, so the defendant is on the hook for the bills. Gets a reduced judgment. We'll be right back. 
>> Jeanne: We're back. The dog bite mige been minor, but the defendant's reaction to it was a major mistake. She is responsible for the actions of her dog -- a dog that was not allowed on the path.

erS ITS C CACT Or a con job? 
>> Judge Brown: When they show up, you said, "no, that's not enough." 
>> Look at the agreement. 
>> Judge Brown: That's almost bait and switch. 
>> Announcer: All rise for judge joe brown. 
>> Judge Brown: Whoa! 
>> Announcer: Experience... Knowledge... And a passion for the truth... 
>> Judge Brown: ...Protecting womanhood and promoting manhood. 
>> Announcer: ...Bringing no-nonsense justice to americans everywhere. 
>> Judge Brown: If you listen, you might learn something. 
>> Announcer: It's time for judge joe. 
>> Jeanne: A couple's car is hauled away after their change of heart on a home. Plaintiffs ciarrah and kenneth manning are suing their prospective landlord for rent and stolen items. Defendant clyde julion says the plaintiffs owe the first month's rent. Now it's "joe" time. 
>> Judge Brown: Let's see. Mr. And mrs. Manning, you're suing your prospective landlord, mr. Julion. It seems confusing, but if I can cut through it all, what it looks like is, you made an agreement with the defendant. And what you're alleging is to move in to this apartment, you were required to give him the first month's rent, $561, plus a $561 deposit. When you showed up, the apartment was not ready for habitation, and before you could move in, when the apartment was ready, you say the defendant demanded another month's rent, another $561. 
>> Yes, sir. 
>> Judge Brown: And by then, you say you weren't prepared to pay that, and he refuses to return your deposit and first month's rent. 
>> Yes, sir. 
>> Yes, sir. 
>> Judge Brown: You also suffered a loss through theft because you were not able to move in, and you say that's the direct consequences of the defendant, right? 

[00:02:10]


>> Yes, sir. 
>> Yes, sir. 
>> Judge Brown: Now, on your side, mr. Julion, you say that they put up a $1,122 deposit to hold the unit for one month. So, they were required to put up a $561 payment for their rent for the month upcoming, when they would have been able to move in the apartment. Is that right? 
>> That's right, as they signed. 
>> Judge Brown: And you say you don't owe them anything. All right. Which one of you wants to talk for the couple? 
>> I will begin talking. 
>> Judge Brown: Yes, ma'am? 
>> Okay. On march 3, 2012, we rolled down ashland, my mom and i. 
>> Judge Brown: This is in st. Louis? 
>> Yes, sir. 
>> Judge Brown: To make a long story short, based on your complaint, which is sworn, you say you needed a place to move to, and you wound up contacting the defendant about a certain apartment. 
>> Yes. 
>> Judge Brown: Now, you indicate that you were advised that the apartment was not ready, but you were further advised it would be available on the 5th of april this year. 
>> Yes, sir. 
>> Judge Brown: So, you were told that there was a rent of $561 and a deposit of $561, which would equate to a total deposit of $1,122. That's what you're alleging, is it not? 
>> Yes, sir. 
>> Judge Brown: All right, ma'am, you say that you called the defendant on the 31st of march. What was that for? 
>> To make sure that the apartment was finished so that we can pick up the keys and move our things in. 
>> Judge Brown: Was it ready? 
>> The apartment was not ready. He said that him and his crew will be working all that WEEKEND, AND BY THE 5th, THE Apartment will be ready for us to move in. 

[00:04:19]


>> The apartment was ready a week later. 
>> Judge Brown: All right. Now, basically, what you allege is you had made a request, when you first contacted him in march, to be allowed to move in, even though the construction was going on. Is that right? 
>> Yes. 
>> Judge Brown: But you were advised that it would not be READY UNTIL APRIL 5th. 
>> Yes, sir. 
>> Judge Brown: When did you tender the $1,122 total to the defendant? 
>> IT WAS ON MARCH 4th. 
>> Judge Brown: March 4th. Did you do that, sir? 
>> Yes, sir. 
>> Judge Brown: Now, you indicate that before you were able to move in, april 5th or whenever it was, you were told on march 31st that you would have to come up with another $561 for the month of april. 
>> Yes, sir. 
>> Judge Brown: So, you say that you were refunded $561. Is that right? 
>> Yes. 
>> Judge Brown: And what was that supposed to be? 
>> That was for the last month's rent. At that time, when he gave us that $561 back, he said he will not give us the other part, because, in march, he could have been showing the apartment to other tenants. 
>> Judge Brown: Well, you paid THE MONEY ON MARCH 4th. Is that right? 
>> Yes, sir. 
>> They agreed, your honor, to hold the apartment, and they put a deposit on the apartment. 
>> Judge Brown: And you consider that $1,122 a deposit? 
>> Yes. And as you see in that agreement that they were supposed to come back to rent the apartment. If it's true what they were saying -- 
>> Judge Brown: Well, hold on. They did. 
>> Yes. 
>> Judge Brown: The way the lease agreement works is the deposit's first and last months' rent. THEY TENDERED, ON MARCH 1st, First and last months' rent. The way this lease, or the rental agreement, is written, sir, that would have entitled them to have moved in forthwith ON MARCH 4th. So, you rented them an uninhabitable apartment. 
>> If that was the case, onor, they would have left with keys and a lease when they paid -- 
>> Judge Brown: Well, you said they couldn't move in while the work was being done, but now they tendered you what you asked. So, then you say, "i want another $561 because first and last months' rent is not enough." And they haven't even gotten the first month. 

[00:06:29]


>> That's not true, your honor. 
>> Judge Brown: Well, that's what it equates to. 
>> They knew that the apartment wasn't ready. They came -- actually, she came with another person. 
>> Judge Brown: Well, excuse me. First and last months' rent -- they can't move in till april, so they paid you first and last MONTHS' RENT ON MARCH 4th. 
>> Yes, sir. 
>> Judge Brown: That meant they prepaid it. So, they didn't need to pay you one dime to be entitled to move IN ON APRIL 5th. 
>> Incorrect. They paid to hold the apartment for 30 days because it was not ready, and they paid a deposit toward the rent for the next month. 
>> Jeanne: We'll be right back with "judge joe brown." 
>> And read the bottom of it. 
>> On number 2, it says to return to rent, and it doesn't say to -- 
>> if you're gonna return to rent something, you got to return -- how are you gonna move in somewhere and not pay your first month's rent? 
>> Jeanne: And later today... 
>> Whenever his do were coming towards mine, I saw that one of the german shepherds was crouching and coming closer to me. And so, at that point, I tried to go upstairs to where the restrooms were. But then, one of the dogs quickly came and grabbed on to my 8-month-old dog. And I didn't want to watch my dog die.

[ Female Announcer ] Pillsbury Cinnamon Rolls. Let the making begin. ?????? ?????? 
>> Jeanne: We're back with "judge joe brown." The plaintiffs in this case say they paid a deposit on an apartment that was being remodeled. When they showed up to move in, the defendant demanded even more money. Let's see what the judge has to say. 
>> Judge Brown: If you take that MONEY MARCH 4th, AND THEY'RE Ready to move in, that is their contracting with you, under your lease agreement, for being in there one month. 
>> Sir -- 
>> Judge Brown: And the last month's rent, another $561, totaling $1,122, that you can't DELIVER UNTIL APRIL 5th. You've had the money they paid you that they could have been earning interest on for a whole 31 days. And then, when they show up, you say, "no, that's not enough. You can't move in here until you pay me the first month's rent." Well, what the hell did you call that $561 first month's and last month's rent? 
>> On number 2, it says to return to rent, and it doesn't say -- 
>> iyou're gonna return to rent something, you got to return -- how are you gonna move in somewhere and not pay your first month's rent? If you paid your money up front, you would have left with keys and the lease. 
>> Judge Brown: It says, "deposit will be applied. Apply deposit of $1,122 to rent apartment degnated." They showed up, ready and prepared to move in with their furnishings and belongings. You barred the door. They had to park outside. And their belongings were stolen in st. Louis as a result. 
>> No, sir, they called -- first of all, I cannot be responsible for something that happened to them after our agreement was over with. That is their business. 

[00:11:29]


>> Judge Brown: 'Cause the contract did not give you any contractual right to demand an additional $521. See, you only were considering $561 as a deposit. He's claiming $1,122. I find that there's no good-faith retention of the deposit. Since he was not harmed, he got the use of your money for 31 bloody days. You suffered, reliant to your detriment on his representations and the written agreement, which both of you signed. So, guess what? He wants to say it's $1,122? I find that the missouri penalty of failure in good faith to return your rental deposit in the time given doubles it. But it's not $521. It's $1,122, which makes it $2,244. In addition, I find, by you relying to your detriment on his representation and then him changing the deal, that's almost bait and switch. So, he's liable for your consequential damages. 
>> Your honor -- 
>> Judge Brown: So, instead of this, instead of getting the $1,400, you're getting $4,200, and that will be your costs, and your costs. 
>> Thank you. 
>> Judge Brown: And you ought to be ashamed of yourself! 
[ Applause ] 
>> Jeanne: The deposit shall be applied to rent -- a simple sentence, but a big turn for the plaintiffs in their case. Makes the defendant liable, and the plaintiffs win big. And we're on to the next case. 
>> Miss Sonia: Please raise your right hand. 
>> Jeanne: Production coordinator casey dady is suing a dog owner for an adoption fee and vet costs. Defendant jeffrey walton says the plaintiff's dog was off-leash. 
>> Judge Brown: Mr. Dady, you say mr. Walton's dogs set upon your dog and that his dogs were off the leash. Now, mr. Walton, you say that mr. Dady's dog was off the leash and threatening your safety. Your dog just simply reacted, or one of them did. In fact, you say you actually got bitten by his dog. Mr. Dady, you give me your version of facts, please, sir.

>> I was hiking on april 18th with a friend and our two dogs. And we had just gotten to chantry flats in los angeles national forest. And whenever I saw two dogs -- two german shepherds off lead -- come towards my dog, I was trying -- 
>> Judge Brown: You're aware that the defendant says categorically that his dogs were on a leash -- on leashes -- and yours was off. But okay. So, there is a discrepancy. I guess we've got a swearing match here. 
>> Yeah. And I also have witness statements that show that his dogs were off lead. But whenever his dogs were coming towards mine, I saw that one of theerman shepherds was crouching and coming closer to me. And so, at that point, I tried to go upstairs to where the restrooms where, to get away and seek refuge. But then, one of the dogs quickly came and grabbed on to my 8-month-old dog. And she was shaken by a rag doll, and I couldn't... At that point, people were starting to gather because we were at the trailhead by the bathrooms. The parking lot was all right there. And I didn't want to watch my dog die. 
>> Judge Brown: Well, he didn't die then. Apparently, he did a day later. 
>> Yeah. You're correct. 
>> Judge Brown: You let go of the leash, and you left your dog there and ran so you didn't have to watch it. 
>> That is correct. 
>> Jeanne: We'll be back with more "judge joe brown" in a moment. 
>> The dog was in shock. He wasn't moving, and so I took the dog and took him and ran him under some water to try to cool him off, 'cause their body temperature is what goes up when they're in shock. And I thought he was gonna be all right for a minute. But they graed him real fast and jumped in their car and just took off down the hill. 
>> Announcer: It's "joe" time after this. ] Dawn long... ...but he'd wait for her forever, for any reason, and would always be there with the biggest welcome home. For a love this strong, Dawn only feeds him Iams. Compared to other leading brands, it has 50% more animal protein. ...to help keep Rocky's body as strong as a love that never fades... if he ever lets her leave again. Iams. Keep Love Strong. 

[00:17:07]


>> Jeanne: We're back with "judge joe brown." The plaintiff in this case says he was hiking with his chihuahua mix when a german shepherd attacked. He says he let go of his dog and n away because he couldn't bear to see his pet die. Let's see what the judge thinks. 
>> Judge Brown: You tell me your side of things. 
>> Well, what I saw -- we were coming up -- we were just ending our hike. We were coming up the hill right to the parking lot, where he's talking about, and a lady had stopped me to ask me where the waterfalls were. And I looked over and saw a dog barking and, like, coming towards me a little bit, you know, how little dogs do that stuff? And I had a leash in my hand, and I didn't have ahold of the leash when he got ahold of the guy's dog, 'cause when he pulled on me, he jerked the leash out of my hand. And then I was right behind him, chasing him. 
>> Judge Brown: You say this dog was barking. Is that all it was doing? 
>> I just heard a bark. I heard him bark, and I looked over and saw my dog pull, just yank towards him. 
>> Judge Brown: Well, was the plaintiff's dog on a leash? 
>> No, I didn't see him on a leash. When I was chasing him, I saw the dog running back to him, like, running to his legs. You know what I mean? My dog caught him right there. I was right behind him. I actually had two dogs with me. And it wouldn't have been for a girl -- he had a girl with him that held my other dog, 'cause i couldn't do anything at first. I had two dogs. I could grab him with the one hand, but if I let go of this dog, she was gonna get in on it, too. So, I had to hold both dogs, and I was yelling at his friend, "hold this dog. Hold the dog." And she finally grabbed the leash, and that's when I could get him off, 'cause then I had both hands to get him off. 
>> Judge Brown: Now your two dogs are champions, right? 
>> Well, yes, the mother and this one both. 
>> Judge Brown: Usa schutzund champions. 
>> Well, he does a sport where he's not dog-aggressive. He has to be on the field with other dogs all the time in his competition. It's like a triathlon for dogs. It's a 3-phase... 
>> Judge Brown: They go over all the obstacles and everything? 

[00:19:08]


>> Well, he has to track footsteps, and he has to do a lot of obedience and stuff like that. But he can't be dog-aggressive to do this sport at all. Then, I took the dog. The dog was in shock. He wasn't moving. And so I took the dog and took him and ran him under some water to try to cool him off, 'cause their body temperature is what goes up when they're in shock. And he started moving around, and I thought he was gonna be all right for a minute. But they grabbed him real fast and jumped in their car and just took off down the hill. 
>> Judge Brown: Now, how'd you get bitten? 
>> Well, when I was breaking the fight up, when I grabbed him, i had him by here, and I started flanking him from the back -- lift him up off the ground and make him let go. And the other dog was kind of flinging around. It just spun around and bit me right here in the leg. I mean, he bit me, not trying to bite me. It was an accident bite. 
>> Judge Brown: Now, what did you do, charge up these stairs when you saw his dog coming? 
>> Well, yeah, 'cause I was putting on my sun cream -- 
>> he didn't help his dog at all. I can tell you that much. 
>> Judge Brown: So, in other words, you saw his dog react to the barking, and you just let yours go and ran up the stairs? 
>> No, he yanked out of my hand. 
>> Judge Brown: Yeah, what I'm saying is, the defendant's dog yanks out of his hand, so you just abandon yours and take off up the stairs? 
>> Because the other people are around. My friend was with me. 
>> Judge Brown: [ Sighs ] 
>> he was with a girl and another guy. 
>> Judge Brown: Well, you know what? A lot of veterinarian offices have 10 commandments of owning a dog, and number 10 is, "don't leave me in difficult times because you can't take it." So, you adopted this dog. 
>> I did. 
>> Judge Brown: But you just ran off and left the dog. 
>> I did. 
>> Jeanne: Judge joe brown makes his ruling after this. 
>> Judge joe brown. 
>> Judge joe. 
>> Judge j brown. 
>> Don't tell me I was punked. 
>> Judge Brown: [ Laughing ] things happen! 

[00:21:09]


>> Oh, my goodness. 
>> Judge Brown: Wait a minute. 
>> [ Laughs ] 
>> Judge Brown: I'm enjoying myself. It's entertainment. 
[ Echoing ] IT'S ENTERTAINMENT. 
>> It's all his fault. 
>> Judge Brown: Why? 
>> Announcer: Closed captioning for "judge joe brown" sponsored by... me? Healthy joints and vv new move free. It helps my body maintain and repair up to 38% more cartilage. Healthy ints move free. lisa, quit. I honestly loved smoking, and I honestly didn't think I would ever quit. 
[ Male Announcer ] ALONG WITH SUPPORT, Chantix is proven to help people quit smoking. It reduces the urge to smoke. It put me at ease that you could smoke on the first week. 
[ Male Announcer ] SOME PEOPLE HAD CHANGES In behavior, thinking or mood, hostility, agitation, depressed mood and suicidal thoughts or actions while taking or after stopping chantix. If you notice any of these stop taking chantix and call your doctor right away. Tell your doctor about any history of depression or other mental health problems, which could get worse while taking chantix. Don't take chantix if you've had a serious allergic or skin reaction to it. If you develop these stop taking chantix and see your doctor right away as some can be life-threatening. If you have a history of heart or blood vessel problems, tell your doctor if you have new or worse symptoms. Get medical help right away if you have symptoms of a heart attack. Use caution when driving or operating machinery. Common side effects include nausea, trouble sleeping and unusual dreams. With chantix and with the support system it worked. It worked for me. 
[ Male Announcer ] ASK YOUR DOCTOR IF CHANTIX Is right for you. 

[00:25:15]


>> Judge Brown: The adoption fee you paid out, $350, is more a contribution to the center that you adopted the animal from so they can keep operating and they don't have to euthanize the animals they get. I think 25% of this is your fault because you let your dog go. So, you're gonna get stuck, on a comparative-negligence basis, with three-quarters of this. So you got to pay three-quarters of the medical bill, which i have authenticated as $512. Seems like a nice-enough dog 
>> I feel bad he lost his dog. 
>> Judge Brown: Everybody does. 
>> I appreciate that. 
>> I got a puppy I'll give you if you're ready to have another dog. I got a 10-week-old puppy I'll let you have. 
>> I'm fine, thanks. 
>> 'Cause I usually sell them for... 
>> Profit? 
>> It's what I do. 
>> Judge Brown: And if you get one of those big ones, please get yourself trained in how to train and handle a dog. There's an art to raising and training dogs. There's an art to raising and training children. And nobody seems to be interested these days. 512 and the costs. 
>> Miss Sonia: This courtroom is now in recess. 
>> Jeanne: A mountain hike resulted in a mountain of vet bills for the plaintiff. That's a fact. The rest of the story depends on who you ask. So, they'll share the bills. We'll be right back. 
>> Jeanne: We're back. GERMAN SHEPHERD vs. CHIHUAHUA -- Not exactly a fair fight, especially when the owner chooses flight over fight. For that, he shares some responsibility he gets a reduced judgment. To submit your case to "judge joe brown," visit facebook or click on judgejoebrown.com.

[00:02:00]

>> Judge Judy: Prior to that, who were you working for? Name of the company.

>> No. 
>> Judge Judy: ...Prior to august.

>> Judge Judy: So you needed some money when you moved into the apartment.

>> Ms. Rocco loaned me money for the move-in.

>> Judge Judy: Did you pay her back? 
>> I PAID HER BACK ON JULY 21st, Your honor. 
>> Judge Judy: How do you know that, sir?

>> Yes, I do, your honor. 
>> Judge Judy: How much money did ms. Rocco give you for your child-support payments when you were unemployed? 
>> I believe a total of $900. 
>> Your honor, it's a total of $1,105, I believe, that I paid off for child-support payments to the two separate moms. The first copy is for the one mother, and then the bank-account statements are for the second mother. 

[00:04:02]


>> Judge Judy:1,005. 
>> Okay, your honor. 
>> Judge Judy:2,365. What else, ms. Rocco? 
>> There's also additional rent for the month of august and september in the amount of $900 for each month. 
>> Judge Judy: Now, mr. Wimer, who paid your rent in august and september? 
>> At the forefront of the month, it was ms. Rocco, your honor. However I -- again, as I just said -- I just paid her $1,260, but without a receipt, I can't prove that, and if she's gonna deny that -- 
>> Judge Judy: Forget the $1,260. I'm talking about rent for two months. 
>> Yes, she paid the $900 on both of the firsts of those months on august and september. 
>> Judge Judy: Did you pay her back? 
>> Yes, I had, but, again, she's gonna deny this. 
>> Judge Judy: How? How did you pay her back? 
>> Well, the v.A. Money that i do get comes through. So, that comes through about the 5th of the month. The rent's due on the 3rd of the month, so -- 
>> Judge Judy: How much do you get from v.A.? 1,586. 
>> Judge Judy: For what? 
>> School -- education g.I. Bill. 
>> Judge Judy: Do you go to school?

>> Judge Judy: Then how do you work? 
>> I work thursday, friday, saturday, and sunday. 
>> Judge Judy: Mr. Wimeryou have sort of a little bit of a nasty smirk, and I'm trying to figure it out, sir. I'm trying to figure out what it is that you're smirking about. 
>> Your honor, I'm actually gritting my teeth and biting my tongue not to respond to -- like I said, I made a payment, and it's being denied. 
>> Judge Judy: Let's go. Respond. I would like to hear you respond. 
>> Well, the fact is, I paid her $1,260 on the 5th of the month. When $900 was due back, I paid that back. That's why I'm saying, flat out, she's lying. 
>> Judge Judy: So far, all I've heard is $1,260. There's a total bill for $4,100. All I've heard is $1,260. 1,260 was the first month's. IT WAS PAID ON JULY 21st. On the 5th of the month in august, I was paid $1,500. 
>> That's not true, your honor. 
>> Judge Judy: Just a second. Mr. Wimer, do you have any proof that you were paid $1,500 from the v.A. In august? 
>> I don't have it on me, but i can easily prove that by going into the computer. It's -- I was paid full payments I mean, I'm sure ms. Rocco would love to contend that, but the fact of the matter is -- 

[00:06:03]


>> Judge Judy: No, no, no. I'm just asking you, sir. Do you have any proof to show me? 
>> I do not have to show you, which is -- that's my fault. 
>> Judge Judy: Well, that's not my fault. 
>> You're right, your honor. 
>> Judge Judy: What you're here for is a lawsuit that -- you knew what that aegations were, you knew what it was alleging that she loaned to you. You knew what your defense was, and your defense was, "i paid back practically everything that I borrowed from her." So all you had to do was bring those -- see, we're not talking about something that happened two years ago. We're talking about something that happened a couple of months ago. So all you have to do is bring me the stubs. I mean, you have paperwork with you. What kind of paperwork do you have with you? 
>> The paperwork is regarding -- after ms. Rocco was removed from the lease on my apartment, which she says she wasn't attending -- 
>> Judge Judy: Just a second. And? 
>> She broke into my apartment. 
>> Judge Judy: So, you brought the stuff for... 
>> I have a... 
>> Judge Judy: ...Your counterclaim... 
>> Yes, your honor. 
>> Judge Judy: ...But none of the material that would be helpful to me in disposing of her claim. 
>> Yes, your honor. I do not have that. 
>> Judge Judy: Well, that's unfortunate, sir. You owe her $4,165. 
>> Your honor, there's also a cash loan that I gave him. 
>> Judge Judy:4,165. You shouldn't have given him a cash loan. 
>> Mm. 
>> Judge Judy: Now, you moved into the apartment on august 15th, AND WHEN YOU MOVED INTO THE APARTMENT ON AUGUST 15th, Your 13-year-old child was living with you? 
>> WE MOVED IN ON JULY 8th. 
>> Judge Judy: July 8th? 
>> Yes, your honor. 
>> Judge Judy: And your daughter was with you for the summer. 
>> My daughter moved in for approximately 28 days. She was only there for one part of one month, 'cause I was in school full time up until that point. 
>> Judge Judy: And where were you living before that, sir? 
>> I was living in a different apartment. I moved -- in the same city, i moved two miles away, your honor. 
>> Judge Judy: Why? 
>> [ Laughs ] 
>> I was living with another woman and, at that time, it was just a bad idea to be living with her, so I moved out, got my -- I had my own apartment. 
>> Judge Judy: Just a second. 
>> Yes, your honor. 
>> Judge Judy: So what you're telling me was you were living with somebody else -- another woman -- in her apartment, and the only way to move out of that apartment was to have ms. Rocco loan you money for this apartment so that you could move out from being with the other lady, while you still lived in an apartment with your husband. Is that what you're telling me? You people actually deserve each other. 

[00:08:19]


[ Laughter ] 
>> Announcer: "Judge judy" continues in a moment. 
>> Judge Judy: We started this case, and I asked you what you do. You said you work for somebody in a business. And now you tell me, you're the lead guy and people work for you. That, all of a sudden, mr. Wimer, became from a worker bee to an entrepreneur in about 11 minutes. 
>> Announcer: And later today... 
>> Judge Judy: A service dog doesn't bite. And, quite frankly, a "three-pound" dachshund sounds more like a bette midler joke than a service dog.

>> Announcer: Real cases. Real people. "Judge judy." Amanda rocco says ex-boyfriend rob wimer owes for loans to pay his rent and child support. Rob is countersuing for unpaid rent, bills, and stolen property. 
>> Judge Judy: Now, I don't want to hear about rent, mr. Wimer, because there isn't any question in my mind that it wasn't intended that ms. Rocco be with you on a full-time basis, because at some point in november, ms. Rocco says she used a key that she had, and when she came home, you were entertaining another lady in your apartment. Well, you would have to be psychotic to be living with one lady and be entertaining another lady in the house when it was the first lady's full-time residence. So I don't believe that your apartment was ms. Rocco's full-time residence, so I don't think she's responsible for any of your rent. Now I'm gonna entertain the part of your counterclaim that involves her breaking into your apartment, because you say she broke into your apartment. Is that true? 
>> Yes, your honor. 
>> Judge Judy: Sir, you can't break into your own apartmen do you understand? 
>> She was removed off the lease one month prior to her entering. 
>> Judge Judy: And she removed a bottle of alcohol that belonged to you. That's the second part of your counterclaim. 
>> Yes, it is, your honor. 

[00:12:51]


>> Judge Judy: Tell me about it, and prove it to me. 
>> I had a 1977 bottle of jim beam, unopened. It's an antique bottle. I've had it for several years. It was in the apartment prior to my apartment being entered without my permission. My only assumption -- which is based on, I knew where it was prior to, now I don't know where it is. And she took several items. 
>> All the items I removed from the house, your honor, were items that I had paid for. 
>> Judge Judy: The only thing he's suing for here is the bottle of 1977 jim beam. 
>> Right. 
>> Judge Judy: And I can't deal with his assumption as to whether or not you took it. Now, you want to get to the property damage, mr. Wimer? 
>> After I broke up with her, then she came over without permission and saw the woman -- 
>> Judge Judy: You broke up with her in what month? 
>> Broke up with me? 
>> Judge Judy: Shh! 
>> And broke up on the month of november, the 1st of november. 
>> Judge Judy: And when was she removed from the lease, sir? 
>> She was removed on SEPTEMBER 30th. 
>> Judge Judy: Well, give me what happened in october. 
>> We still had, you know, business transactions that were going on together. 
>> Judge Judy: What kind of business transactions, mr. Wimer? 
>> Somebody who works for me also works for her. 
>> Judge Judy: Explain that to me. What do you mean, "somebody who works for you"? Works for you doing what? 
>> On moving job he works -- you know, he's one of my guys that works for me. 
>> Judge Judy: Mr. Wimer, we started this case, and I asked you what you do. You said you work for somebody in a business. And now you tell me, you're the lead guy and people work for you. That, all of a sudden, mr. Wimer, became from a worker bee to an entrepreneur in about 11 minutes. 
>> That's actually what happened. 
>> Judge Judy: That's really very successful. Judgment for the plaintiff in the amount of $4,165. Your counterclaim's dismissed, mr. Wimer. That's all. 
>> Thank you. 
>> Byrd: Parties are excused. You may step out. 
>> I'm happy with the decision. Obviously, I paid out money over the course of our relationship, and I'm glad to be getting it back. 
>> I was a little bit unprepared, but I believe it was a joke anyway. 
>> You know, you kid of want to give people the benefit of the doubt when they're in a hard time. 
>> Goodbye with bad rubbish. It's not even a point to sit there and throw anymore dirt in the situation. 
>> The signs are there -- they don't have a job. People are telling you stuff to listen to it because the chances are that it's true. 

[00:14:54]


>> You live, and you learn. I'm learning a lesson today. The lesson is, don't waste time with bad rubbish. You know, it took this many months. She's got a husband at home. Go back home to him. 
>> Announcer: And now the next case. 
>> Byrd: All parties in the MATTER OF WEGENER vs. TANGEN, Step forward, please. 
>> Announcer: Jim wegener is suing his former tenant, taragen, for rent, the return of a barbecue and foosball table, and for damages to his property. 
>> Judge Judy: Mr. Wegener, the defendant was a tenant of yours. The gravamen of your complaint is that she owes you rent. I mean, you have some other things sort of floated in there -- that there was some damage to the property. The damage to the property consisted of those little styrofoam balls that were scattered throughout the property, which, really, involves clean up. And then you say she took two items -- an old barbecue and a foosball table that I assume was also there from a previous tenant. So with regard to those two items, the defendant says you told her that she could have what was there from the previous tenant. She says she doesn't know how those little annoying things that you can't pick up got into the bushes. But she has an explanation with regard to why she did not pay rent. 
>> I sure do. 
>> Judge Judy: Which I find interesting. Not compelling,but interesting. 
>> Announcer: "Judge judy" continues in a moment. 
>> Judge TELL ME WHAT THAT Service training consisted of... 
>> [ Laughs ] 
>> Judge Judy: ...For this three-pound dachshund. You're playing with me, and we're not gonna play with each other. 
>> I'm not playing with you, your honor.

>> Announcer: Real cases. Real people. "Judge judy." Jim wegener says his former tenant, tara tangen, owes for rent, the return of property, and the cost to clean up his backyard. Tara is countersuing for slander, invasion of privacy, and assault. 
>> Judge Judy: Okay. When did she move in? 
>> FEBRUARY 15th. 
>> Judge Judy: And with om did she move into this property that you own? 
>> Her 7-year-old son, anthony. 
>> Judge Judy: Did you have a lease? ??> yes. 
>> Judge Judy: I'd like to see it. While I'm looking at that, when did she move out? 
>> MAY 7th -- I THINK THAT WAS On a friday. 
>> Judge Judy: What was the rent on the apartment, ms. Tangen? 
>> It was $900. 
>> Judge Judy: And the rent was due on the 15th of the month? 
>> By the 15th of the month. 
>> Judge Judy: Okay. Did you pay rent in february? 
>> I did. 
>> Judge Judy: March? 
>> Yes. 
>> Judge Judy: April? 
>> No. 
>> Judge Judy: Why? 
>> Well, about the end of march -- he was hounding me for rent before even the 1st of the month. And, you know, our rent, my rent was due middle of the month. And weeks before, he's coming by, asking for rent and for supposed pet deposit for a companion animal for my child. And I just -- I didn't even have the money in to pay my rent, let alone the extra $900 for the pet deposit. 
>> Judge Judy: When you moved in, were you supposed to have a dog with you? 
>> Yes. And I also submitted a copy of the doctor's note from his doctor for the companion animal. Federal regulations and state regulations of the state of idaho state that with a doctor's note and accommodation, he cannot charge me a deposit for a companion pet. 
>> Judge Judy: I'm just curious about the regulation that you're talking about, ms. Tangen. I would like to take a look at what it says. I still don't understand why you didn't pay april's rent. You lived there. 
>> I'll get into that with you, your honor. I'll tell you. 
>> Judge Judy: Well, i understood what your defense was. Your defense was, you didn't think he was paying the mortgage and you thought the place was going into foreclosure, so you didn't pay rent. 

[00:20:07]


>> Yeah. 
>> Judge Judy: Well, that's not a legitimate reason for not paying rent. You have to pay rent -- you lived there. So you owe him $900 for rent. Okay. Now, first of all, what kind of dog do you have? 
>> It was a piebald dachshund -- a little wiener dog. 
>> Judge Judy: Did you discuss with the plaintiff the dog? 
>> Yes, I did. 
>> Judge Judy: And he didn't say anything to you at that time about a pet deposit. 
>> He said that he would come up with a fee. And at that time, I gave him the letter from the doctor. 
>> Judge Judy: Just a second. When he said he would come up with a pet-deposit fee, did you say, "i'm not paying a fee"? 
>> I did. 
>> Judge Judy: Did she say that to you? 
>> No. 
>> Judge Judy: I think you're making that up as you're going along, madam. Because if he said, "i'm gonna do a fee," and you said, "i'm not paying a fee," he would have said, "this is somebody i probably don't want as a tenant." Okay. You have a counterclaim. I'm prepared to hear it for 30 seconds because it's a little fuzzy. 
>> Okay. Yeah, it's a little fuzzy, all right. 
>> Judge Judy: Your complaintis fuzzy. 
>> Oh. 
>> [ Laughs ] 
>> well, I filed a counterclaim... 
>> Judge Judy: I got it. 
>> ...BECAUSE ON FEBRUARY 21st, Mr. Wegener came to the house to install some mini-blinds in our living room. 
>> Judge Judy: Go ahead. 
>> Okay. Well, mr. Wegener was, you know, shaking the mini-blinds out of the end of the box when the dog was sitting there, and he had nudged over and kicked the dog a little bit out of the way. Well, when the dog turned around and went after him, he got angry and started yelling and started using profanity in front of my year-old son. 
>> Judge Judy: Did the dog bite him? 
>> No. The dog growled at him. 
>> Judge Judy: The dog, according to you, bit his pant leg. The service dog doesn't bite. 
>> Well -- 
>> Judge Judy: Service dogs don't bite. And, quite frankly, a "three-pound" dachshund sounds more like a bette midler joke than a service dog. 
[ Laughter ] 
>> I don't think that's legitimate. 
>> Judge Judy: What specific training did your dog have to be a service dog? 
>> He went through obeence training. 
>> Judge Judy: Tell me what that service training consisted of... 
>> [ Laughs ] 
>> Judge Judy: ...For this three-pound dachshund. You're playing with me, and we're not gonna play with each other. 

[00:22:11]


>> I'm not playing with you, your honor.

Some people had changes in behavior, thinking or mood, hostility, agitation, depressed mood and suicidal thoughts or actions while taking or after stopping chantix. If you notice any of these stop taking chantix and call your doctor right away. Tell your doctor about any history of depression or other mental health problems, which could get worse while taking chantix. Don't take chantix if you've had a serious allergic or skin reaction to it. If you develop these stop taking chantix and see your doctor right away as some can be life-threatening. If you have a history of heart or blood vessel problems, tell your doctor if you have new or worse symptoms. Get medical help right away if you have symptoms of a heart attack.

>> Judge Judy: Now, if he was a companion for your child because it was good for your child to have a companion, then say that. And if you say that that's a service dog, that, to me, isn't a service dog. That, to me, is a pet that you got to help calm your child. But that doesn't mean it's a service dog and it's been trained. 
>> The reason why the dog is considered to be a service dog is because he was trained -- my son would get up and sleepwalk at night, and he has been found blocks away from the house. 
>> Judge Judy: Well, that's your fault. That's your fault for not creating an environment where, if your 7-year-old child -- who suffers from autism -- you know gets up and walks around and can get out of the house, then you haven't prepared your house in such a way that that doesn't happen. And if what you're telling me is that this three-pound dog followed him when he went for a stroll, that doesn't make your dog a service dog.

=======================================================

Er, she gave me the money. 
>> Judge Judy: Got it right the first time. 
>> Announcer: ...Mom got the cold shoulder. 
>> He started refusing to pay. And I says, "hey. You need to give me this money or I'm gonna have to sue you." He is my son, so I wasn't counting on that. 
>> Judge Judy: Well, then, if he's your son, then you don't come to court with him. 
>> Announcer: "Judge judy." You are about to enter the courtroom of judge judith sheindlin. The people are real. The cases are real. The rulings are final. Captions paid for by cbs television distribution bonnie moore is suing her son, brent reichert, for a loan to pay an irs debt and for the return of furniture. 
>> Byrd: Order! All rise! Your honor, this is case number 461 on the calendar in the MATTER OF MOORE vs. REICHERT. 
>> Judge Judy: Thank you. 
>> Byrd: You're welcome, judge. Parties have been sworn in. You may be seated. Ladies, have a seat. 
>> Judge Judy: Ms. Moore, this young man is your son. 
>> Yes. 
>> Judge Judy: Your complaint alleges several things, but to me the most important thing is the claim that he has an outstanding loan to you for a debt that he owed to the internal revenue service. You took out a loan to pay off that debt or did you have the money? 
>> I had the money, your honor. 
>> Judge Judy: And it was an agreement with your son that that money would be paid back, and, according to you, he did, in fact, faithfully pay back payments on that loan up until, I believe, december of 2011, when he stopped. 
>> Yes, your honor. 
>> Judge Judy: How much was the original loan that you made to him? 
>> It was $4,900 altogether. 
>> Judge Judy: Why did you owe so much money in back taxes, mr. Reichert? 
>> I ended up filing taxes incorrectly and ended up paying it off with my credit card. In doing so, it ended up doing a, you know, high interest rate, which ended up costing me about $200 a month, and she loaned me the money -- er, she gave me the money to -- 
>> Judge Judy: Got it right the first time. 
[ Laughter ] 
>> sorry. She gave me the money to pay off the debt. 
>> Judge Judy: Which was $4,900? 

[00:02:01]


>> No, $4,000.4,000. 
>> Judge Judy: She says it was $4,900. You say it was $4,000. 
>> Yes, ma'am. 
>> Judge Judy: Your mother says that you made payments to her faithfully and only $2,100 of that $4,000 is left. Are you denying that youade payments to her? 
>> No, I'm not denying. 
>> Judge Judy: In what amounts did you make payments and from when to when? 
>> It wasn't really a set base, but what happened -- 
>> Judge Judy: From when to when? 
>> I would say july to december. 
>> Judge Judy: And approximately how much each month did you send her? 
>> Actually, it really wasn't a monthly basis. 
>> Judge Judy: So how much money did you give her between july 2011 and december 2011? 
>> I would say about $2,500, roughly. 
>> Judge Judy: Did you give it to her in check or cash? 
>> Cash. 
>> Judge Judy: Where were you when you gave her the money? 
>> At my house. 
>> Judge Judy: She would come and get it? 
>> Yes, ma'am. She would stay with me. 
>> Judge Judy: For how long a period of time would she stay with you? 
>> Sometimes months at a time. 
>> Judge Judy: And when she stayed with you for months at a time, was it just the two of you in the house? 
>> I do have a roommate. 
>> Judge Judy: And when your mother stayed with you in the house, did she help out with the rent? 
>> No, ma'am. 
>> Judge Judy: She just stayed as a guest. 
>> Yes, ma'am. 
>> Judge Judy: Tell me why. 
>> You know, I love my mom to death. She's a disabled vet. I would do anything for her. You know, I drive her to appointments and everything like that. You know, make sure that she's taken care of. I would drop her off at her house. She lives three hours away, so it's a six-hour drive. 
>> Judge Judy: What was she staying in your house for? 
>> I'm really close to the v.A. Hospital, which, again, she lives three hours away, so it's a very -- lot shorter commute. 
>> Judge Judy: So that when she was receiving whatever treatments she was receiving, she would stay at your house. 
>> Yes, ma'am. 
>> Judge Judy: Is that correct? 
>> That is correct. 
>> Judge Judy: Okay. 
>> Not for a month at a time. 
>> Judge Judy: Was it during that time, though, that you made this loan to him? 
>> Yes, your honor. 
>> Judge Judy: Did he pay you back at the same time every month? 
>> No, your honor. 
>> Judge Judy: Tell me about payments that he made to you. 
>> If I needed my car insurance paid, he would pay that. If I needed extra money for a bill or my car to be fixed, he would pay that. Then he started refusing to pay me money so I can fix my car. He says my car is too old to be fixed. 

[00:04:14]


>> Judge Judy: So he didn't pay you money. What he did was, you advanced him this money, and if you needed an insurance payment paid, he would pay it. 
>> Correct. 
>> Judge Judy: Uh-huh. And if you needed a meal or if you needed something else, he would take care of it. 
>> Correct. 
>> Judge Judy: Well, how in the world do you expect a court to figure that out? 
>> I don't, your honor, but when he paid me my last payment in december -- 
>> Judge Judy: What kind of payment? 
>> He gave me a $500 payment... 
>> Judge Judy: Yes? 
>> ...To my account. 
>> Judge Judy: Well, is this the first time he hamade a cash payment instead of paying your insurance or your meal? 
>> No, your honor. No, your honor. He would give me cash sometimes for just when I needed the extra cash. 
>> Judge Judy: As he was paying for your insurance or a meal or something to pay off this alleged loan -- 
>> well, he was all caught up. 
>> Judge Judy: Listen. Listen to me. Do you have a roster of what monies he paid towards this loan. 
>> No, your honor. He kept that file at work, and when I asked him how much he owed me still, he said he would get back with me. When he finally got back with me, the amount was, like, $3,600, so I kept track of it from then on. I never kept a roster because he was my son and I just didn't think nothing of it. 
>> Judge Judy: How am I supposed to figure it out? 
>> I posted it and I says, "hey. You need to give me this money or I'm gonna have to sue you." And then he would make -- 
>> Judge Judy: Just because he said that to you -- that's not my question to you, ms. Moore. My question to you, ms. Moore, is if you make a loan -- let's for the moment say that this is not your child. Let's say it's a friend or somebody that you loaned money to, and you say, "you have to pay me back" -- according to you -- and I'm reading your statement. "I lent him $4,900 with the agreement that he would pay me $200 a month until the debt was fully repaid. He was paying me steadily." Well, that's not what you just told me. What you just told me was sometimes he paid for an insurance bill, sometimes he paid for a meal for you, you needed gas for your car, he would put that in, and that's how he was making his payments to you for the loan. And I'm asking you how do you expect a court to figure out what, if anything, he owes you. 

[00:06:26]


>> He acknowledged that he -- 
>> Judge Judy: Show me. Show me how he acknowledged that he owed you money. Then acknowledgement of the debt I will receive. 
>> Well, here's a text message. And it says that -- I says, "when can I get my money?" And he writes, "very nice. Correct. Congrats." He never tries -- he cuts it off and he doesn't... 
>> Judge Judy: All I want to see is where he acknowledges that he owes you money and how much. 
>> It says, "i have to sue you, then." I don't know where it is, ma'am. 
>> Judge Judy: Do you understand what I'm saying to you. 
>> Yes, your honor, I do. 
>> Judge Judy: How do I know what he owes you? He says you lent him $4,000. Not $4,900. He says you gave it to him. Let's say you loaned it to him -- $4,000. He says he's paid you back $2,500. That's what you say. 
>> Yes, ma'am. 
>> Judge Judy: You say, "he hasn't paid me back $2,500. He's paid me back..." 2,700. 
>> Judge Judy:2,750. 
>> Yes, your honor. 
>> Judge Judy: How am I supposed to figure all that out if you don't keep tabs on what's going on? 
>> Right. He is my son, so I wasn't counting on that. 
>> Judge Judy: Well, then, if he's your son, then you don't come to court with him. 
>> Correct. 
>> Judge Judy: However, I'm gonna take his figure of $4,000, unless you can prove that you gave him $4,900. Can you? The answer is -- can you? In a writing, in a check, in a something. 
>> No, your honor. 
>> Judge Judy: Fine. 
>> I have the amount of money that I pulled out of the account. 
>> Judge Judy: That doesn't tell me that you gave it to him. Did you write him a check? 
>> No, your honor. 
>> Judge Judy: Okay. Let's say $4,000. And you say he paid you back $2,750. Leaves $1,250 left. That's what's left. That's according to your number and her number. 
>> Mm-hmm. 
>> Judge Judy: Okay. Which is not a way to do business, but it's the best i could do. Now, the next part of your suit is that he has certain property that belongs to you. 
>> Yes, your honor. Sometimes I would stay up there and he would give his bed up for his buddies or myself, and instead of doing that, I brought my twin bed up so that they could use it and I could use it. And he's moved three different places with that furniture and that bed, and then now he don't want to give it to me. 

[00:08:41]


>> Judge Judy: He's not gonna give it to you. He's moved to three different places and now you want your bed back? Forget it. 1,250. Now, you have a nonsense counterclaim, sir. You want t me about it? I have 30 seconds for you. 
>> Ma'am, I lent her a cellphone. 
>> Judge Judy: I don't do cellphones. Next. 
>> I lent her a laptop. 
>> Judge Judy: A laptop is a different story. You lent her a laptop when? 
>> It was roughly, I would say, november. 
>> Judge Judy: Roughly in november? 
>> Yeah, I would say around that time. 
>> Judge Judy: This must have been very important to you. 
>> No, I got it from my grandma for school. I'm a full-time student at i.T.T. Tech. 
>> Judge Judy: Do you have another laptop? 
>> I do. 
>> Judge Judy: So you gave her an old one? 
>> Yes, ma'am. 
>> Judge Judy: That you got from your grandmother? 
>> Yes, ma'am. 
>> Judge Judy: And you want to complain that she broke it. 
>> Yes, ma'am. 
>> Judge Judy: Forget it. What else is next? Next. 
>> The next -- it would be the monitor that I lent her for her computer. 
>> Judge Judy: Did you have another monitor? 
>> Yes. 
>> Judge Judy: Where'd you get the monitor from? 
>> I bought it. 
>> Judge Judy: When? 
>> Probably two years ago. 
>> Judge Judy: Goodbye. You owe your mother $1,250. That's all. Thank you. 
>> Byrd: Parties are excused. You may step out. 
>> It just looks really bad, you know, bringing your son to court. 
>> No, it's not about the money. I actually wanted my furniture back. 
>> We should have been able to handle this within -- internally. 
>> I felt like he was using me. 
>> I think she didn't approve of grandma -- er, my girlfriend... 
>> And I think it had to do with his girlfriend. 
>> ...That I was dating. And I think really that's what sparked it. 
>> That maybe she didn't like me. I'm not sure. 
>> I think this is gonna spread us apart, you know? We might have been able to save something, but... 
>> He has severed all ties. 
>> You know, it's totally, you know. 
>> Which is -- that's his doing, not mine. 
>> Announcer: And now the next case. 
>> Byrd: All parties in the MATTER OF MILLER vs. ARRIGONI, Step forward, please. 
>> Announcer:20-year-old stacey miller is suing her former roommate, 21-year-old mollee arrigoni for rent, damages to their apartment, and for breaking their lease. 
>> Judge Judy: Ms. Miller, it is your claim that the defendant, who used to be your roommate, owes you some money for rent, damages to the apartment, and the fact that you had to pay for breaking a lease because of something that she said. Now, when were you roommates? From when to when? 

[00:10:46]


>> July 7, 2011, until she moved out on october 1, 2011. 
>> Judge Judy: Do you have a lease? 
>> I do. 
>> Judge Judy: Is the lease in your name and hers? 
>> Yes. 
>> Judge Judy: Why did you move out? 
>> Because she actually had up to 23 animals in our apartment, and I couldn't deal with the stench. She wasn't picking up after them. 
>> Judge Judy: Okay. That's why. She had 23 animals that you couldn't deal with. 
>> Correct. 
>> Announcer: "Judge judy" continues in a moment. 
>> Judge Judy: Your lease prohibits pets. And how many pets did you have? 
>> Five. 
>> That's not correct. I have pictures, first oall. I also have a birthday card where she signed most of the animals' names on it.

>> Announcer: Real cases. Real people. "Judge judy." Stacey miller says former roommate mollee arrigoni broke their apartment lease. She is suing for rent and damages to the apartment. 
>> Judge Judy: Okay. And did your lease prohibit animals? 
>> I agreed to four in the beginning. 
>> Judge Judy: That's not my question. I said, did the leaseprohibit animals? 
>> It allows two animals in the apartment. 
>> Judge Judy: "No pets are permitted without an additional pet agreement. Tenants will be responsible for any and all damage caused." You have a pet agreement? 
>> There was no pet agreement. The landlord knew about one dog. 
>> Judge Judy: Don't tell me about what the landlord knew. I'm telling you that your lease... 
>> Yes. 
>> Judge Judy: ...Prohibits you from having pets. 
>> Yes. 
>> Judge Judy: Your lease prohibits pets. And how many pets did you have? 
>> Five. 
>> That's not correct. 
>> Yes, it is. 
>> I have pictures, first of all. I also have a birthday card where she signed most of the animals' names on it. 
[ Laughter ] 
>> Judge Judy: How many ani-- let's not say "pets." How many animals did you have? 
>> I owned five animals. The rest were in and out. I work for my father at a pet store, so they come in and they leave. 
>> Incorrect. 
>> Judge Judy: I don't care. At any one time, did you have more than five pets in your house? 
>> Yes. 
>> Judge Judy: Okay, well, then, she has a right to move out. You're violating the lease. She doesn't have to hang around when you have a dozen animals coming in and out of your house. Okay. Now, tell me what you're suing her for. 

[00:15:31]


>> I'm suing her for a month's rent. 
>> Judge Judy: Which month? 
>> November. 
>> She wasn't living there in november. 
>> Judge Judy: Shh! Shh! If you shout out again, she's gonna win, and you won't like that. Got it? 
>> Okay. 
>> Judge Judy: November 2011. 
>> Yes. 
>> Judge Judy: Were youliving there in november of 2011? 
>> No. 
>> She was entering and coming in and out of the apartment in 2011. I have a picture of her actually reclaiming her key with a bunch of comments underneath it saying that she was coming in and out of my apartment while she was not living there. 
>> I was -- 
>> Judge Judy: No! 
>> It's right here. 
>> Judge Judy: No. When did she move out of the apartment? 
>> OCTOBER 1st. 
>> Judge Judy: Did she pay you for the month of october? 
>> Yes. 
>> Judge Judy: Who was living in the apartment in october? 
>> Me and chris -- my room-- my boyfriend. 
>> Judge Judy: He's not on the lease. 
>> He was not. 
>> Judge Judy: In july, when you moved in, who moved into the apartment? 
>> Me, mollee, and chris. 
>> Judge Judy: Chris moved in when you all moved in in july. Is that correct? 
>> Correct. 
>> Judge Judy: So, the landlord only allows two people in the apartment, and that's ms. Miller and ms. Arrigoni. 
>> Mm-hmm. 
>> Judge Judy: So, now there are twothings that are the breach of the lease. First of all, the boyfriend is living there. And then you have animals there in violation of the lease. 
>> Our apartment manager knew and accepted the fact that he lived there. 
>> Judge Judy: No. This is your lease. Anything outside of this lease, any verbal change to this lease, is inadmissible in a court. So, whether your landlord knew that you had a dog, whether your landlord knew that your boyfriend was living there -- i don't even hear it. It's like a windshield wiper in a car. It's only meaningful -- if you have a written lease -- if any change to this written lease is also in writing. 
>> I understand. 
>> Judge Judy: Got it now? 
>> Yes. 
>> Judge Judy: S she wasn't living there in october. 
>> No. 
>> Judge Judy: But she paid october's rent. 
>> Correct. 
>> Judge Judy: So, you had a month, if you wanted to, to replace her, replace... 
>> That's what we were trying to do. 
>> Judge Judy: That's all right. You had lots of animals there to keep you company.

>> She owes me for the damages due to the apartment and the lease-breaking fee. 
>> She had someone else --

>> Judge Judy: Now, november, she wasn't living there. So, you explain to me why you think she's responsible for november's rent when she moved out in october. 
>> She was coming in and out of the apartment with a key from the manager all throughout october and november. 
>> Incorrect. 
>> Judge Judy: All I want you to do is prove that to me. What's your name? 
>> Chris. 
>> Judge Judy: Chris what? 
>> Lowery. 
>> Jud Judy: So, youdid these e-mails with her. 
>> Yeah. 
>> Judge Judy: Back and forth. Okay. What converter boxes are you talking about? 
>> Those were the comcast converter boxes that were in my name. 
>> Ourname. 
>> Judge Judy: Shh. Don't interrupt again or you're gone. 
>> Sorry. 
>> They were in myname, and i had texted stacey on multiple occasions, asking for those converter boxes back after she had signed me off the lease. And she had to reapply for the apartment on her own, which she didn't do. Technically, I was still on the lease, and she wasn't -- 
>> Judge Judy: I don't want to hear "technically." 
>> Okay. 
>> Judge Judy: All I want to do is hear about the converter boxes because chris, mr. Big mouth, seems to talk about these thin. 
>> Well, those were actually the converter boxes that I was paying for. The comcast bill was actually in my name. I was paying for them. She wasn't gonna give them back. So, since I was still technically on the lease, the landlord gave me a key so i could go in and retrieve those converter boxes. 
>> Judge Judy: Did you get them? 
>> Yes. I gave the key back to the landlord after I had retrieved the comcast converter boxes. 
>> Judge Judy: You have any proof that that's not true? 
>> Not written down, no. 
>> Judge Judy: Not anywhere. 
>> Except for my visual proof that I saw her coming in and out of the apartment-complex parking lot, the fact that my door was unlocked when I came home. 
>> When? 
>> Judge Judy: She doesn't owe you for november's rent. What else? What else?

[ Laughter ] listen to me. I'm not here to discuss her social life. I'm asking you what else do you think she owes you for? 

[00:21:38]


>> She owes me for the damages due to the apartment and the lease-breaking fee. 
>> Judge Judy: Okay, now, she moved out in october. 
>> Yes. 
>> Judge Judy: Did you take photographs of the damage that she did to the apartment in october? 
>> I did not. 
>> Judge Judy: And you lived there in october? 
>> I did.

>> Judge Judy: Now, do you have proof in writing, when she moved out in october, that you gave her notice in october that she caused damage to the apartment? 
>> No, I do not. 
>> Judge Judy: Are you still living in the apartment? 
>> No. 
>> Judge Judy: When did you move out? 
>> NOVEMBER 29th. 
>> Judge Judy: Did you break the lease? 
>> I did. 
>> Judge Judy: So, what do you think she owes you money for? 
>> Damages and repairs and the leas- 
>> Judge Judy: She's not paying any money for damages and repairs. What else? 
>> The lease-breaking fee. She's the one who left me with five days' notice that she was leaving. She did not tell me she was leaving 30 days in advance. She gave me five days' notice. 
>> Judge Judy: No, she didn't. If she paid you for october and SHE MOVED OUT ON OCTOBER 1st, That means she gave you 30 days' notice, which is actually pretty nice of her tw do, considering the fact that you had broken the lease by having a menagerie in the apartment. So, what you told me -- I'm going based upon what you told me alone. What you told me was she paid october's rent, and she moved OUT ON OCTOBER 1st, WHICH MEANS You had 30 days' notice. Not only did you have 30 days' notice, but she wasn't even there. 
>> She was on the lease the entire time, coming in and out. 
>> Judge Judy: Goodbye. 
>> Byrd: Parties are excused. You may step out.

>> I think she got what she was -- what was coming to her. Pp>> there was marks on her wall ppFROM ALL THE PARTIES. 
>> Actually, I only had one party. 
>> She was absolutely disgusting. She would get high. 
>> And I did smoke weed once in there. 
>> There was pot-stain holes in the carpet in her room. 
>> But she actually smoked with me. 
>> And then she would just eat and put all of her stuff everywhere. 
>> So, it's kind of a catch-22 for her. 
>> It was just a disgusting mess, and it was her fault.

Captioning sponsored by th CENTURY FOX TELEVISION Good evening. Customer service. Yes. I had, uh, some suggestions I'd like to talk to you about. (sighs) Oh, a talker. (stilted voice): You have reached our Automated Suggestion Center. Please leave your message for... Phillip Martin. But then the rash went away, and I couldwear pants again! Yup. Yup. Dale. Hank's going to become a tugboat captain. Yup. Gla-gla ixnap bongo. Mm-hmm. (sighs) No one listens to me. Do you guys think horses remember things from when they were little? The picture's so blurry. Is that what's-his-name from 90210, or what's-his-name from Growing Up Brady? I'm fed up with this TV. We have got to get a new one. (gasps) Perhaps even a flat-screen TV? Absolutely. Hank! Dad! Okay, whatever it is, let's just slow down here. We don't need an expensive flat-screen TV, Peggy. That CSIlady looks just fine on the TV we've already got. Well, sure, we don't needone, Hank, but I want one, and I am prepared to pay for it myself. You haven't sold a house in six months, Peggy. You know, if you put it on a credit card, I still have to pay for it? You don't think I can pay for this TV, do you, Hank? Well, uh... (sighs) no. Bobby, get ready for the biggest, flattest TV you have ever seen in your life. Peggy, you don't

have to do this. We'll just keep the TV we have. No, let her do it, Dad. It will help her to heal. I shopped around all day, and the good flat-screens still cost a lot more than I have in my savings. Good flat-screens? Oh, you mean, like... this? (dramatic music plays) Yes, Minh,ike that. I will get the money somehow. I just have to come up with a clever invention. Something that lights up and that kids put on their shoes. Or you could get another job. I bet there's a lot of wives that would like you to be their husband's secretary. No need to work for TV money. Make your personal savings work for you. Listen to my secret friend. The Dow Genius. So, we had a down day in the market. Automated voices: Oh! Do we get scared? (scream) No! We go to Brazil where they are cornering the bird flu vaccine market. Buy Bioteca De'Brasilia! Symbol: Bdsa. (bells clanging, horns blaring) Well, this is amazing! I am in for a thousand. I will buy a gigundo new TV. For Hank, it will be 79 inches of "So there!" Hey, maybe I go in for a grand myself. I'll sell a few guns and invest, too. Financial dignity might be an interesting switch for me. (mugs clinking) Minh, our stock has lost 20% in a few days! Is there any chance we can return our stocks at the earlier price? Dow genius: Okay. So the market's had a downturn. The Genius feels your pain! Ow! Ow! Ow! This is crazy. Every time we obey his shouting, I lose more money. We should just cut our losses. I'm gonna admit failure and ask Nancy to reinstate my allowance. 

[00:04:00]


No, I will not be a failure or look like one. I have got to win at this. Come on, you idiot. Tell us something brilliant. People, you have to remember that everybody invests differently. When the market is slow, buy what you know. Buy the companies that make what the average people are buying. He has a point. We need to study America, and invest in what America wants to buy. Okay, good. What? What do people like to buy? I don't know. Lychee nuts? Opera CDs? Those new Russian bullets that will go through anything! Uh, no, not you two. America. What does Joe Blow buy? Beats me. I give up. Then we are going on a field trip. America, roll up your sleeve. Peggy Hill is about to take your pulse. Okay, they out of pretzels, but not popcorn. Chocolate snack cakes are sold out, too, but not pound cake. There has to be a pattern here. There's no pattern, Peggy! It's like Americans are just a bunch of pigs rooting aimlessly in the dirt. Look at that! Who on earth would buy something as repulsive as chocolate-covered potato chips? (grunts) Sorry, Minh. Oh, hi, Minh! I'm just so excited they restocked the chocolate-covered potato chips! These things fly off the rack. I need this and this, and this and this... Mine! I need extra, so I'm covered for the weekends. (whispers): Minh, look what's in Bill's cart. He got the snack cakes, the pretzels, the aerosol cheese. What he buys, the rest of them buy. Think about it. Bill is middle-aged, obese, with disposable income, and poor impulse control. He is the average American consumer. Bill is our golden pig! Ho, yeah!

Hmm. Oh! I need jumbo wrap! Mega-Lo-Wrap. Check. What on earth he wrapping with that much wrap? The American consumer doesn't know. All it knows is it must wrap. You know, I know it's just Bill, but something doesn't feel right about this. Do-Do you think we should tell him? We can't tell him. People act most natural when they don't know they're being observed. I cite as evidence several hundred episodes of Candid Camera. Hmm. Let's... see. I like shopping with all of you. Usually, the only people who talk to me in stores are older gay men who've dropped their standards. Well, buy something already! Okay! Ooh! I read about this. A mini jungle gym for your cats to play in. You don't have any cats. Well, I might... someday. Bill: Ooh! Castle Wolfehammer 9! "Sergeant Vengeance battles the Furious Fuhrer!" Hey, C-Hammer Nine! Right on! So, Bill, where ya feel like going for lunch, huh? So. Heh. "That's a Real Italiano!" Heh-heh. Home of the Spaghetti Sandwich. I recommend the Jumbo Spaghetti Sandwich. It's my favorite. Well, it certainly is... popular. (whispers) And publicly traded. Ho, yeah. (cheering) All right!

This one here is top-of-the-line. If it's the top of the line, I'll take it. Uh, care to add a "Super-Surround" system, with ultra stereo boost? Throw it in. Well, here we go. Everyone ready? (blaring): It's third and eleven. The Cowboys have got to pass... (shrieks) Oh, my gosh, Hank, turn it down. Turn it down, Hank! I can't tell... which button. Dad! Make it stop! Oh, goodness. Well, it's got a little something under the hood there, doesn't it? I'm proud of you, Peggy. I cannot believe this amazing TV is really in our house! Yeah, Peggy, how did you afford this? I mean, it had to be pretty expensive. Hugely expensive, but at does not matter anymore. I am so excited I can finally tell you. I have discovered a secret gold mine. Uh, I don't like the way you just said "gold mine." What do you mean? ...so we made all this crazy money, just by studying Bill. You don't look proud of me anymore. Well, I wonder why not. Peggy, you used Bill. You have to fix this. I hope you're not gonna say we should get rid of the TV. Well, of course not-- it's incredible-- but you have to tell Bill what you've been doing. Promise me you'll do that. Then let's go back to watching this amazing thing. So... you were... studying me? You listened to me! My opinions made a difference! So you're not mad? No. I'm honored that you cared what I thought. You folks feelin' like dessert? Yeah. Bill, dessert! What do you, want to have? Huh? 

[00:12:41]


Hmm... Good point. What doesBill want for dessert? Hank: And it displays windows within windows. I still haven't figured out how to make those go away, though. It's so nice when people care what you have to say. Hank, why didn't you ever tell me what it was like? Well, I'm just happy you're okay with it. I thought it might make you angry. Of course you thought Bill would think that. But only Bill knows what Bill thinks. You have this nice TV because I have the power of being me. Bill, you don't have powers. It works because you're so... typical. not the one who's typical, I am. I buy things, and it makes money, so we can buy more things. I'm like an ecosystem. Bobby: Dad, look! Two Rob Schneider movies on-screen at the same time. You're welcome, Bobby. So, how are our profits this week? Minimal. We need to diversify. All our positions are still in junk food and cat toys. "Hedge funds... global indicators..." Hey, thiech sector" stuff must be important. The article on it is really long. Check this out: There's a big computer trade show in Austin next week. Okay, computers. What will Bill pick for us? Robots? I hope he chooses some robots. Wow... it's so incredible. So this is the future, huh? (sighing) I don't know. Everybody's so cool. It's not about being cool, Bill. This is about what regular Americans are going to buy. Now-- digital cameras. What do you like? Well, I just... I don't know... I mean, I, I think... Don't think about it. Just be Bill. PEGGY: Come on, Bill. Just pick something.

(mumbling): I don't know. I don't know. I... I... I... Damn it. We broke him. He's useless now. This is classic Heisenberg. The observer effect. Observer? Wha...? The very act of observation interferes with the outcome, often misattributed to Heisenberg, who was wrong about the bomb, but right about uncertainty. See, now you're watching you. And that's the problem. It shows up in AI theory, too. Quite so. Anyway, this thing is a wash. You're broken. Game over. Oh, dang it. I was gonna get Hank a La-Z-Boy with a fridge in it. They have those. Eh, it was pretty good while it lasted. No! It's not over! I can still do it! America will love, uh... this! No, wait. Come back! Come ba... I'm still Bill. I can pick winners. Nobody can be Bill like me. I'll show them. I have to show them. (tones chiming) (woman's voice): This is 24-7 Stockz. So, what are we trading? Hi. If, if I use my savings and take out a second mortgage on my house, can I open a trading account? You betcha. Good because I want to buy, buy, buy. King of the Hill did hours? I played a round of golf. Then I read a book while teaching myself how to play guitar; ran miles while knitting myself a sweater; jumped out of a plane.

[00:18:59]


Well, what do we do next? Now that Bill's melted down, he won't be any help anymore. How about we try the Dow Genius again? Dow genius: Let me put it this way, ZNE Technologies is like a Mafia wife... Do not touch! Okay, next caller is Bill from Texas. Howdy, cowboy. Bill: I've gone broke. Well, maybe it's not our Bill. Okay, Bill from Arlen, Texas is broke. Happens to the best of us, big man. Uh-oh. Please, please help me. I've mortgaged my house; I used all my savings to invest in a sure thing, but then... Whoa, slim, you telling me you bet your whole nut on one stock? Give me the nutcracker. Let's see it. (chuckling) Don't laugh at me. I was once a stock-picking genius, but I made so much money for my friends... (sobbing) (clicks TV off) We're still not 100% certain that was ourBill. (doorbell ringing repeatedly) Minh? Are you home? Peggy? Anyone? Maybe we should just go out there and, and talk to him. And say what? Sorry, your life is somehow even worse than it was? Yeah, and besides we didn't do anything. Oh, come on, we used him for our own gain until we broke him, and then we cast him aside? Then, in a desperate attempt to regain our love, he lost everything he owned. But other than that, we're good, right? (Bill blubbering) (blubbering and sobbing) (speaking Turkish) What are these words? Can't we get rid of those guys? Who are they? No idea. Dang it. There are so many buttons on this remote. Ew! Ew! Oh, it hurts my eyes! It's too detailed! This is what madness must feel like! 

[00:21:03]


Oh, thank goodness. Somehow it went to sleep. (Bill sobbing) Now what? What's that voice? It's just Bill. (Bill blubbering) (crashing) (sighs) He doesn't sound too good. Bill: My strategy was sound. I leveraged liquidity, but there were negative market corrections. Overall I give myself an "A" for theory. Bill, you don't know what any of those words mean. I just wanted people to listen to me, Hank. It's so awful being ignored. You know what's gonna be even more awful? You're gonna lose your house. How much are you on the hook for? (sighs) A lot. And not my usual "a lot." This time I'm being accurate. ighs) Dang it. All right, I'm gonna go find the others. (loud fanfare) (all gasp) (classical music blares) It was on "Sleep." And then it stopped sleeping. Don't leave us alone with it. Unplug it to be sure. Who knows what it'll do next? (screaming) Oh, thank God! I thought you were Bill! How could you three do this? You know the way Bill is, but you took him out for a spin anyway. We feel terrible. I want to help, but the Gribbles have a long history of making things worse. Well... I guess we could sell off our holdings to pay off Bill's mortgage ourselves. Hank, I know how much you love it, but the TV came from using Bill and... Sell it. Yes, anything to, uh... help our friend. You are an inspiration, Hank.

[00:23:16]

(cheering) 5,000? That's nowhere near enough. The man mortgaged his house. How about this: Instead of selling off more guns, I could just leave a few out on Bill's doorstep, and let come what may. (sighs) Let's just give him this much. It's better than nothing, and at least we tried. Thank you all. It's awfully generous. But I won't need this money now. It turns out after all that... You know where a working man can get a cold beer around here? In the kitchen. Even total strangers don't care if they interrupt me. Sorry, Bill. Looks like he's here helping Buck move the TV today. Go on. What's the use? Anyway, thanks for the money, but I'm safe now. I declared bankruptcy this morning. You declared bankruptcy? Well, it's Texas, Hank. They're pretty efficient about this sort of thing. They even had a special E-Z-Broke phone line. Anyway, I won't take up any more of your time... Whoa, hold on, friend, not so fast. Did you just say you got a bona fide, state-certified bankruptcy? Yeah. Ooh, how does that work? Do you have to declare all of your assets or can you keep your offshore money? And who were you hiding your money from? Your wife? The government? I want to go bankrupt some day. I just want to owe a little more fit. Is it hard to pull off? Oh, no, it was so easy, even I could do it. Well, don't just repeat that part, my man. Give us the whole gory details. Wow, I can't believe you want to hear what I have to say. Well, Buck, if you'll hand me that beer, I'll tell you all about it. Fantastic. Darrin, this could take a while. Man, I'm all over this. Apparently, there are a lot of bankruptcies. The E-Z-Broke guy was very helpful... Let me tell you, it's pretty scary seeing all those zeroes at first, but...

>>> Breaking news, house republicans have just wrapped up a meeting to discuss the fiscal cliff deal worked out by vice president joe biden and senate MINORITY LEADER mitch McConnell. The deal which passed overnight will see income taxes rise on individuals making over $450,000 a year, and families making over $550,000 a year. Let's listen in now as house democrats speak. 
>> Caucus meeting which -- in which the vice president not only roused the entire membership, but also gave us a very thoughtful and detailed explanation of what's gone on, and how it was that he and the president working with the democratic and republican leaders in both houses were able to come together on this compromise. We first want to say thank you to the vice president for being so gracious. Quite honestly, so frank in his conversation with us in explaining as much as he could about what's transpired over the last several weeks. We now are waiting to hear from our republican colleagues, whether or not they want to do at the senate did in a very bipartisan fashion and give the men people an opportunity to have a vote. There are people throughout this country who might look at this deal and love it. Some might hate it. Some may not and were it. But we firmly believe that every american in this country should have a right to have a vote in the peoples house. The senate sent us the bill. We're hoping the house will respect the wishes of the american public and let the representatives of those people vote up or down on that legislation. And with that, will the me turn to our leader, nancy pelosi. 

[00:02:05]


>> Thank you very much, chairman. Last night the senate -- I guess it was early this morning, the united states senate voted in an uncharacteristically strong bipartisan way, 89 votes in favor of the compromise legislation. This is -- that was historic. That legislation was sent over to the house. Up until now our speaker has said when the senate acts, we will have a vote in the house. That is what he said. That is what we expect. That is what the american people deserve. So we look forward now, as we go forward in this day, to see what timing will be for a straight up or down vote on what passed 89-8 last night in the united states senate. Today we had the privilege, as our chairman said, of hearing from the vice president. He talked about what's in the legislation and what lies ahead and difficult negotiations as we go forward. We had a frank, as you said, mr. Chairman, frank discussion in that regard. Right now other members after thoughtful deliberations and review are continuing to review the legislation, weighing the pros and cons. Weighing the equities of not going over the cliff, but we are all eager to see the form that the republican leadership will put on to the floor today. I think that we've made gigantic progress. I hope that we can have a bipartisan agreement as we go forward. But as I said, our members are making their decision now, and we look forward to hearing what the republicans have to say. The person who will know best what our numbers are in this regard at some point during the day is our distinguished master counter, distinguished mr. Hoyer. 
>> Thank you very much, madam leader. 112th congress has about 46 hours left to go. This congress unfortunately has been most known for an unwillingness to compromise. An unwillingness to come together to act on behalf of the american people. TODAY IS JANUARY 1st. Taxes will be going up on everybody in america if we don't act. Those who are relying on unemployment insurance, millions of americans relying on unemployment insurance to make sure they can support themselves and families, if we don't act will be at risk. Vice president biden has worked very hard to come to a compromise. By definition, a compromise has elements in it that each party does not like. But by definition, it has things in it that each party should like. The speaker said that if the senate passed a bill he would put it on the floor for a vote. The leader has pointed out that we expect that to happen. We think that's the best interest of the american people. We hope that our colleagues on the other side of the aisle can reach compromise. Our members are reviewing the specifics of the compromise that has been reached to determine whether they can support that compromise. I'm hopeful this congress will, as one of its last acts, act not only on this compromise, but I'm also very hopeful and would expect that we would provide the emergency assistance needed for the victims of sandy. One of the country's worst storms in history that damaged the northeast so badly. So, I'm hopeful we will be able to move on both of these issues and that we will have members on both sides who perhaps will not agree, but hopefully we will have members on both sides who will agree and we can act as the mesh people expect us to do so. 

[00:06:19]


>> Can I ask you -- 
>> you're from -- we'll hear from the incoming vice chairman as well. 
>> Thank you. I'll be very brief. I think the difference between a divided government and disfunctional government is the willingness to compromise. We saw that in the senate as leader pelosi and mr. Hoyer have said. That means looking at an agreement and deciding whether on balance it helps not democrats or republicans but whether it helps move the country forward. And we're hopeful that republicans in the house will do as democrats and republicans did on the senate and weigh all the equities here, but decide at the end of the day not everybody gets 100% of what they want. Democracy means a willingness to come together for the good of the country, that's what compromise is all about, especially in an era of divided government. Our members are taking a look at the bill. And, you know, we just would ask our republican colleagues to bear in mind the good of the country as they also weigh all the equities here. With that, I turn it over to the distinguished vice chairman, mr. Crawly. 
>> Thank you, chris. I will add briefly we all appreciate the vice president coming to the caucus today in a straightforward, thorough way, explaining the process, the negotiation and why we are where we are at today. I do think, though, the time for discussion and talk is coming to an end. And it's going to be time for us to vote soon, or all this would have been for naugt. Our being here new year's eve, new year's day, would have been for naugt if we don't come to a vote. That's what the american people expect and deserve out of this process. We can either move forward in a bipartisan way, hand in hand to avert the fiscal cliff, or our republican colleagues could help lead us off of that cliff. 

[00:08:32]


>> Questions? 
>> I think you were first. 
>> Can I ask, what are your spies on the other side in a sense telling you how it's going over there? You have to count heads with them as well. 
>> I'm not stipulating to any characterization of any information that we received from our friends in the press. I really have no idea. 
>> You have to get with them as well to approve this. What are you hearing from the other side? 
>> I think that your question is better addressed to the republicans coming out of their conference. We just came out of ours, and we know what you tell us as to what's coming out of their conference. 
>> Let me just say, we have not had an opportunity to talk to their leadership at this point in time. 
>> Since our votes. 
>> You said just a moment ago you would prefer a straight up and down vote on that. 
>> Absolutely. 
>> Is that because of the time or this was a deal brokered by the vice president? 
>> No, it was a bill passed in the united states senate, 89-8. Tell me when you had that on a measure as controversial as this. I hope we don't have a re-enactment of that where the republicans in the house painted themselves in the extreme of not wanting to find compromise an a solution. Let's be optimistic. Let us all, as mr. Hoyer and others have said, that they decide in favor of the country as we go forward. The issue of whether we have an up or down vote shouldn't be a question -- there shouldn't be a question. We were told when this -- we would not have any legislative -- legislation on the floor until or unless the senate acted. When they d we would have a vote. So we want to have that vote. We look forward to what the timing is on that. This is all about time. It's about time we brought this to the floor. As mr. Hoyer mentioned, it's only been a matter of a couple of months since the election, eight weeks. In that period of time we've been pushed to even into a new year. It's long overdue for us to have this solution go forward and remove all doubt as to how we go -- what comes next for our country. So we expect, the american people deserve an up or down vote on what wed in the senate. 

[00:11:14]


>> If there is an up or down vote, how many democratic votes will you be able to deliver? 
>> That's not a subject that I'm going to talk about now. 
>> Members are considering the legislation. They just heard from the vice president. And we will find out which members -- 
>> you're saying you want bipartisanship from the other side, don't you have to say that you're willing to support had piece of legislation? 
>> I don't think there's any doubt that we'll have bipartisanship. She asked me for the number. I don't have a number. I can tell you we will have a bipartisan vote. 
>> Thank you very much. 
>> When will you start whipping? 
>> We just finished hearing about house democrats about the physical cliff negotiations ongoing. To give a little tick tock of what we've seen, both house democrats and house republicans had separate meetings about the legislation passed early this morning in the senate overwhelmingly, 89-8. We saw vice president biden leave the vice president leave, then boehner did leave. A number of house democrats did come out and speak at length and take questions. We are going now to mike who is standing by with more on this. The message from the house democrats seem to be very clear, they want a vote on this. What can we deduce? 
>> I'm hearing from our crack production team, they're standing outside the gop conference, eric canter, the number two in the house of representatives, he says that he cannot support the bill. He cannot support the senate bill what does that mean? That means the house is going to vote to amend the bill. They do not think there are enough spending cuts in this bill. That's what we've been hearing consistently as news trickled out from that closed-door meeting. They have broken up that one meeting. They will have another later today. This is not going as smoothly as a lot of people had hoped, particularly after that 89-8 vote in the senate in the wee hours of the morning, about 1:45 a.M. In the senate when they voted. Unprecedented, amazing bipartisan vote, really. Up to the house now. The senate has gone to the winds. Here's what happens, this is complicated and vital. Not to mention interesting. Let's assume that the house amends the senate bill. The senate is gone. They don't expect to come back to the next congress that begins ON JANUARY 3rd, THAT'S THURSDAY. Let's assume the house votes tonight or tomorrow to change the bill. If the senate doesn't act by the time the next congress is sworn in on thursday, we're in a brand new congress. A congress must be sworn in on january 3rd that means we start over again on the floor of the house and senate. The stakes could not be higher at this point. This is big news. 

[00:14:30]


>> And what are you hearing about what happened in the meeting that the republicans had? Speaker boehner had said repeatedly if the measure went through the senate, they would take it to a vote. 
>> Eric canter, the number two republican in the house of representatives, has come out of that gop conference, outside that conference and told the conference the gop members that he could not support the senate bill. Other members have come out and said they want to change the senate bill. 
>> I'm sorry to cut you off, mike. You have such great information. We have to go. Just to recap the headline, it doesn't look like we'll see a vote on this today. We'll be following the latest. Find us online,

>>> Women's health care, equal pay for equal work, birth control. Those were the issues that republicd to tackle in 2012. It was a year when women were almost forced to have an invasive and unnecessary ultrasound. Governor tom corbitt didn't understand what the fuss was about. 
>> Did that go too far in your mind? 
>> Make anybody watch? Okay. You have to close your eyes. 
>> It was a year in which republican presideial nominee campaigned on defunding planned parenthood. Would not take a position on the lily leadbeater fair pay act. And bragged about his governorship of massachusetts. 
>> We took a concerted effort to go out and fine women who had backgrounds to become qualified as members of our cabinet. I went to a number of women's groups and said could you find us folks? They bought us binders of women. 
>> It was a year when republicans pushed for extremist candidates like todd aiken and richard murdoch. If it's a legitimate rape, the female body has ways to shut that whole thing down. 
>> I struggled with it myself for a long time. I realized life is a gift from god. Even when life begins in that horrible situation of rape, it's something that god intended to happen. This contraceptive thing, it's so inexpensive. Back in my days, they used bayer aspirin for contraceptives. The girls put it between their knees. It wasn't that costly. 
>> It all started in february when republicans held a hearing on the affordable care act's contraception man dade. No women testified. Democrats were allowed to invite one witness. They george sandra flock, chairman of the house oversight committee darrell issa rejected her as n qualified to speak on the matter. She eventually gave her testimony in front of a democratic congressional panel and became a target of the biggest voice of the republican party, rush limbaugh. But before limbaugh could launch his smear campaign against a private citizen, sandra gave her first national interview here on "the ed show." 

[00:19:06]


>> Great to have you with us. I understand that you had already planned your testimony. You were going to cite some examples of people who could have benefited from president obama's mandate for birth control coverage. Share with us what you would have told that committee today. 
>> That is what I was there to speak to the committee about. That's why I was so stunned when chairman issa made the decision to not allow me to speak on behalf of those women and to say that I was not an appropriate witness. That those women's stories were not appropriate. I cannot think of who would be more appropriate for the committee to hear from, than the women who are affected by this policy whose lives were affected. One of the women I wanted to talk about today is a close friend of mine. She has polycystic ovarian syndrome, so what that means is she needs to take contraception for medical reasons to stop cysts from growing on her ovaries, and not to prevent pregnancy. That technically means it should be covered on georgetown's student health insurance, which does not cover contraception for prevention of pregnancy, but unfortunately, when university administrators and employers and insurance companies get involved in deciding whose health needs are legitimate and whose aren't, what happens is that women's health needs take a back seat to that type of ideology. That happened in her case, and we found it happened in 65% of the female students cases. For her, she was unable -- they repeatedly refused her contraception coverage claims. She had verification from her doctor, it didn't matter. She had to pay out of pocket about $100 for her, month after month after month. And eventually she just couldn't afford it, like many students just cannot afford that kind of a cost. And she had to stop taking it. I have to tell you, it is so -- what happened is that after a few months of her not taking the prescription, a massive cyst grew on her ovary. And she woke up one night in the middle of the night in terrible pain. She told me that it felt like she had been shot. And I don't want to imagine what that felt like for her. But what ultimately happened is that she had that ovary removed. She had to have it surgically removed. And as a result of that, of course she would have problems conceiving a child. But even more, it just -- it has not stopped for her. She -- she, since the surgery, has experienced the symptoms of early menopause. And her doctors are very concerned that at the age of 32 she is entering early menopause, which means that there is nothing any doctor can do to help her conceive a child, and it will put her at risk for -- increase the risk for cancer, heart disease, and osteoporosis. And that is where she was this morning when I was attempting to tell her story in front of members of congress. She was at the doctor's, trying to cope with the symptoms she was experiencing.

>> Are people on campus, is this really hitting the attention of women you intera with professionally in the school setting? 
>> Oh, my goodness, unless you studied at one of these schools, I can't explain to you what it is like on campus. We have been following the regulations ever since the affordable care act was passed. It is a fight we have been fighting for years, literally for decades they have been struggling. This has made so much difference a difference for us. 
>> Sandra fluk, I appreciate you being here tonight. I know they watch on capitol hill. Great testimony here on "the ed show." And I think you'll probably get an opportunity to talk more with people who are in position to talk with others that make decisions that affect the lives of women, I really appreciate you being here tonight.

>>> Welcome back to msnbc and our rolling coverage of the fiscal cliff deal. The vote overnight was 89-8. It's over in the house. We heard from house democrats as they finished their caucus. Coming out in support of that deal that came from the senate and was approved in that vote 89-8. Nancy peloyey there as well, to count the votes to make sure how many theyld guarantee to support that bill. There's a recent development we have learned here at msnbc. We are hearing there is not support coming from cantor. The speaker is not sure -- he walked by the cameras earlier. Did not make a commen nbc's mike viqueira what are you hearing? 
>> Eric cantor, the number two republican after john boehner, the speaker of the house voiced his lack of support. He will not support the bill that passed the senate last night. It was about 1:40 last night in the morning, 89-8. The senate passed it. They largely left town. They left it up to the house of representatives to decide what to do to avoid the fiscal cliff. The house must act on the senate bill and pass it if it's to come to the president's desk for his signature. The house leader said last night they will either do that -- first they will take time to look at it, talk about it. They will either pass it as it stands or amend it. Evidently what we found out right now, the significant fact that the number two republican, eric cantor, known to be a conservative leader, of course, is going to oppose it, it's looking as though republicans in the house of representatives are leaning towards amending the bill. That means the senate now, largely out of town, would have to come back, the house votes to amend it, they could hold this vote tonight or tomorrow, send it back to the senate. The senate largely gone. It raises the possibility that the new congress which is sworn IN ON JANUARY 3rd, THURSDAY. That's set forth in the constitution. If they can't get their ducks in a row by then, you start over in the congress. All the negotiating and haggling we've seen over the last several weeks and the last several intense days of negotiation between joe biden and mitch McCONNELL WOULD GO FOR NAUGT. They would have to start over. That's an enormous development. I must caution that we do not know. House republican s have not tipped their hand on what they'll do. They are upset not only about having a bill put before them that requires those making more than $450,000 or $400,000 if you're an individual, 450,000 if you're a couple filing jointly, to pay a higher tax rate, income above that level goes from 30% to 39.6%. They are upset also about the lack of spending cuts. There's revenue from the tax side, but not a corresponding, for republican tastes, amount of spending cuts. That is what they're likely to try to do. They're likely to try to change this bill. Procedurally, you look at the tick tock here, it could have vast repercussions for the markets that open tomorrow if this is not settled and it's still open in the air as well as the larger american economy. A lot of the plans here, hanging by a thread. This thing could come off the rails. We're not sure what the republicans in the house are going to do exactly. The idea was john boehner, the speaker of the house would have to say to his folks, look this is a bad deal. We'll live to fight another day, hold your nos and vote for this. Apparently the opposition there is very strong. The feelings are very strong within the house gop conference. We're not sure how this will go. But now a big question mark hangs over this legislation. 

[00:31:03]


>> Needless to say, nobody wants to see this drag on anymore. Needless to say, you have been covering this. Let's go over to luke russert also watching this for us. What are you hearing in terms of eric cantor and speaker boehner now. 
>> It's a wild story, richard. I have some details about that meeting that happened on capitol hill. I heard there are about 40 members who spoke um in that meeting. 37 of the 40 who spoke up spoke out against the bill. One member who is pretty close to the house speaker, john boehner, told me "it was like living in another world, listening to some of the things my fellow members were saying." Talking about maybe we should have hundreds and millions in spending cuts to this amendment we will send over. This member told me he felt his colleagues did not have a clear idea of what exactly was happening throughout the country. That this idea that the senate last night had an 89embers voting together in a bipartisan way, that this was missed on his colleagues in the house does does this mean? Eric cantor said he was not for it as it currently was. He wanted to see an amendment. Johoehner has been silent about this. I'm hearing harry reid would essentially laugh at that and say are you kidding me? We spent this time, joe biden AND mitch McConnell spent all this time trying to get an agreement. What are we supposed to do with this? This leaves the question out there, could we go over the fiscal cliff entirely? We are teetering on the edge from where we stand now, it's a good possibility. I will say though, if john boehner wanted to take this bill and put it to the floor without amendments, essentially having a profile in courage moment t would probably pass. From the republican I spoke to in the room, they said if there's an appetite for folks who have been around here for a while to get this over with, they can live to fight another day on the debt limit and on the government funding bill. But this would be a pr disaster for republicans. There is nowhere else for this bill to go. If the house gop tries to administration this with this short amount of time left, they feel, this member spoke to me and folks close to the speaker, theblame would be on them. The sandy supplemental bill for the relief and the folks effected by the hurricane, that's tied up in this, too it's a fascinating development on capitol hill. It shows you nothing is over for the 112th congress. 

[00:33:45]


>> Fascinating insight into what was discussed in the caucus. Luke, stand by for a second. We will go back to mike who is also getting information about speaker boehner. 
>> I'm sure luke has the same information. It comes from brendan buck, a spokesman for the speaker of the house, john boehner. He says the speaker and leader, the leader eric cantor, laid out options to the members and listened to feedback. The lack of spending cuts in the senate bill was a universal concern among members in today's meeting. Conversations with members will continue throughout the afternoon on the path forward. Again, everything up in the air there, as luke h been reporting. I just want to re-emphasize what luke was talking about in terms of the congressional schedule. The constitution says the new congress, the 113th congress will be sworn in on thursday. If you look at the procedures, everything that has got to happen if this new -- if this old congress, this existing congress is to pass this legislation, if the house were to amend it -- assuming. We don't know what they'll do. It sounds like they're leaning in that direction. It would have to go back to the senate. The senate has scattered to the winds at 2:00 this morning. A lot of ifs and buts in this thing. There is the possibility this could carry over into the new congress which would mean the slate is wiped clean. They could not take up the senate bill. They would have to started again. 
>> They would be sworn in at noon on that thursday, the 113th congress. They have roughly about 80 or 90 new members, including democrats as well as republicans. As luke was speaking about the timing here, what could happen, despite cantor saying he could not support the bill the way it stands, vick, would see see speaker boehner consider this moment of political courage that luke was hinting at and still bring this bill to the floor and have the numbers as it may look like right now to get it passed? 

[00:35:58]


>> First of all, I mean that would involve a fascinating dynamic internally with the house republican conference. Eric cantor came out and said he will not support it. There has been tension between the top two republican leaders, a rivalry. Many people have written about it. It's not a big secret. I'not talking out of school here. Eric cantor stood four square behind boehner throughout this negotiation over the course of the last two months. Ten days ago, in the speaker's plan b, when that crashed and burned, eric cantor stood behind john boehner. So we don't know -- it doesn't appear. We can't report there's division among them now. But it certainly is a significant development. Obviously cantor is influential, particularly among house conservatives who are the heart of the republican party. John boehner has said in the days leading up to this, as it was being negotiated this deal between McConnell and biden, that he would not put something on the floor that was a democratic -- would require a majority of democrats to pass. A lot of people talked over the course of the last several wfeks about the majority, the majority tradition in the house of representatives. I'm here to tell you, this is not dig that john boehner or denny hastert made up, this is the way it operated since almost the early 19th century and the days of henry clay, that is the speaker of majority party will not put a bill on the floor that does not get a majority of the party. A lot of people thought 89-8, boehner will put this on the floor, he will tell them you will live to fight another day. The automatic cuts known as a sequester, they are punting those for two months, the funding bill is set to expire at the same time. Leaders have been telling their rank and file we will fight then. It will be much better political ground. Apparently that has not carried the day here. Not enough spending cuts as mentioned this that statement by the speaker's spokesman. Not enough spending cuts to satisfy republicans. They will do what they feel is best. They will amend it, send it back to the senate and that raises the question whether this can get done by noon on thursday and avert the fiscal cliff. Obviously the holiday is over tomorrow. The markets are open. People are back to business and earning paychecks. Paychecks that will be taxed at a much higher rate. 

[00:38:35]


>> The question is if speaker boehner will violate the rule, will he bring this bill to the floor and not have majority. 
>> That's still a question. 
>> But still get the bill passed. 
>> Stand by. We will continue to discuss these latest developments coming out of the house and whether or not this bill coming from the senate, 89-8 will be taken up on the floor. Stay with us. But, I didn't always watch out for myself. With so much noise about health care... I tuned it all out. With UnitedHealthcare, I get information that matters... My individual health profile. Not random statistics. They even reward me for addressing my health risks. So I'm doing fine... but she's still going to give me a heart attack. We're more than 78,000 people looking out for more than 70 million Americans. That's health in numbers. UnitedHealthcare. Our rolling coverage of breaking news coming out of capitol hill. This as we're getting wordthat cantor said he could not support the senate bill that was passed earlier 89-8. Boehner did not say either way. We are also ing that as the bill came to them from the senate, he would also be a no. Luke russert has been following this throughout the last 24 hours and all the things. U have with you the representative. 

[00:42:48]


>> You're a close ally of speaker boehner. What happened in conference today? What was so problematic with this bill? 
>> The difficulty is it's heavy on tax increases. The spending reductions are basically nonexistent and adds about $600 billion more in spending. 
>> Where do we go from here? You think there will possibly be a vote tonight on an amended bill? 
>> The overwhelming consensus in the conference was that the leadership should go back, huddle, find an amendment that addressed spending in a responsible way. It's not going to be some amazingly huge package, but a token and symbol that is not the poison pill that does not drive the democrats off the wall. There was discussion about something that the president himself already suggested, to lay don't marker as we move forward, it's not just taxes, but spending as well. 
>> What was looked at that the president already suggested? 
>> They were not specific. There was a lot of talk about sequester. As you know, in the senate proposal, sequester is delayed for two months. Half is paid for by new taxes, half by tax gimmicks. In an amendment, it would say if we're not going to do sequester, it should at least be with real spending cuts. We are getting indications from the senate they would not even look at an amended bill, sort of the idea that time has run out. mitch McConnell, joe biden, they were here until the early hours of this morning on new year's day. What happens -- are we going to go off the cliff? 
>> I don't know. That will be a decision for the senate. Quite frankly, the senate had in its power for over six months to do what it did at the stroke of midnight last night. That's amend the house bill and send it back to us. It's unreasonable for senator reid to say that something they produced on new year's eve, produced by a bunch of sleep-deprived people is what we shouldcantor, you said, is against the bill. Boehner received opinion. Boehner can't go over cantor on this one. 

[00:45:07]


>> The speaker needs 218 votes. So they're trying to craft something to get 218 vote which has been an elusive target in this 112th congress. I sensed if they came up with something responsible and reasonable and laid down the marker on spending, that will be there with the spear. 
>> Going forward, do you think -- how many folks do you think in your conference would support the bill as it is now? 
>> That's hard to say. But it certainly wouldn't be the majority. The majority, I don't even know if you would hit triple digits. If the bill came up in its current form, I would vote for it because I think it's unreasonable to hold hostage 95% of america and say you will get a tax cut because we can't get our business taken care of. That doesn't mean it's a good bill. It would be a hold your nose, jump off the flat form vote. 
>> You think the number f we're talking the hastert rule, boehner wants the majority. So on this bill, 60, 70? Could you get that? 
>> I would put it in the 40, 50 range. 40, 50 right now. 
>> Maybe. 
>> Still a lot of room to go. 
>> If the democrats stem up, the math becomes a differe equation. You have to get to 218. 
>> Are you worried that the house republican conference will singlehandedly receive the blame if the united states goes over the cliff because they want this bill amended? 
>> I watch your network a lot. Republicans get the blame if it's sunny outside. People make their own judgments. The people I represent, I come from a swing distance say this is a problem. People should pay their fair share and there should be more revenue. 
>> Representative steve latourette, thank you. Richard, back to you. 
>> Thank you. Very insightful there. Getting an and wering of what's being discussed in capitol hill. House republicans expecteded to have another meeting in the coming hours. We'll watch that and look at what some of the repercussions are, based on what rptdive latourette told luke russert on this issue of eric cantor not supporting the bill as it stands coming over from the senate. 89-8 earlier today. Stick with us. We'll get back to capitol hill in a bit. ring... Progresso This reduced sodium soup says it may help lower cholesterol, how does it work?

>>> R50i9 right now our members after very thoughtful dlab rations and review are continuing to review the legislation weighing the pros and cons, the equities of not going over the cliff, but we're all very eager to see the form that the republican leadership will put onto the floor today. I think that we've made gigantic progress. I hope that we can have a bipartisan agreement as we go forward. 
>> All right. House minority leader nancy pelosi, gigantic progress is the word she used there, and then just about 30 minutes ago we learned this. This coming from a spokesperson for eric cantor saying the speaker and leader laid out options to the members and listened to the feedback. The lack of spending cuts in the senate bill with a universal concern amongst members in today's meeting. Conversations with members will continue throughout the afternoon on the path forward, end quote. Representative latourette giving us more body around what that sentiment is. Representative latourette saying eric cantor said he would not support the senate bill in its current form. Then we spoke with luke russert moments ago who was telling him he needed more spending cuts to that. Mike viqueira, who is in washington, d.C., Following this with us, what might be these symbolic spending cuts specifically that might be out there right now that would be palatable in this back and forth that the we're seeing? 
>> Reporr: Well, you know, it's impossible to say, richard. We can look at the recent past history of this negotiation, and the speaker was talking about -- he's been talking about it since the day after the election quite publicly, quote, simplifying the tax code on the revenue side to generate more revenue. He was talking about on the spending cut side entitlement reform. You know, that what we called the chain cpi, the adjustment to the social security cost of living formula that had been on the table, then it wasn't on the table, then it was on the table and then off again, that's something that democrats had opposed quite vehemently and which ultimately ended up out of the deal that was brokered by mitch McConnell and joe biden. So, I mean, I don't want to get too far down this road because I'm not quite certain what it is the republicans have in mind, although they always have a list of spending cuts at the ready. Richard, just to reset a little bit here and talk about the significance of what is going on here this afternoon, if everybody expected this to go smoothly in the u.S. House of representatives after an overwhelming 89-8 vote in the united states senate at 2:00 in the morning last night, well, they're going to be disappointed if that was your expectation anyway. The house republicans have been meeting behind closed doors for much of the afternoon. They have recently emerged and we have learned that the number two republican in the house, eric cantor, has said that he will not support the bill. Now, for a leader to come out publicly against it means that it is most likely not going to be put on the house floor. The republicans are strongly leaning towards as you read from that statement from the spokesman for both cantor and house speaker john boehner, towards amending the bill and adding more spending cuts and sending it back to the senate. Okay. That's the normal legislative process. That's the way it goes, this game of ping-pong between the two cchambers. Problem is time is out. We are over the cliff. No harm there. Folks are not back to work. The markets are not open. If the house is to amend this bill and they haven't decided concretely whether they're going to do it or how they're going to do it, there's another closed door meeting of the house gop conference slated for this afternoon as leaders are huddled right now in the capitol trying to figure out their next move, if they're going to amend it tonight or tomorrow, it's going to have to be sent back to the senate if any changes are made. If they change one letter, one motor, one iota of this bill. That's schoolhouse rock. We've all learned that although we're far from schoolhouse rock at this point. The senate would have literally one day to do something, and the senate is not in session, assuming this is what the house ends up doing, and january 3rd is the day the new congress is sworn in. The existing congress, the 112th, the 113th comes in at noon on thursday, and if that happens and nothing is done by then, that he is no deal, there's no vote on identical pieces of legislation, the legislative slate is wiped clean and legislatively the process has to standard over again and meantime, people's paychecks are going to be taxed at a much higher rate, the markets, who knows what the markets are going to do, but they could pretty much go haywire at least in the short term and a tremendous amount of pressure is going to be mounting on these house republicans, on the congress, to do something. It was thought that overwhelming vote last night would st of strengthen john boehner's hand if he went to his conference and said this bill stinks, you know it, I know it, let's hold our nose and vote for it, let's live to fight another day. A lot of deadlines coming up, another fiscal cliff if you can believe it. Apparently that argument has not carried the day. House republicans are cleaning toward changing the senate bill.

>> Mike viqueira, who has been watching this debate go back and forth, we now are getting some indications that with only 44 hours left in the 112th congress, they still may not have a deal that will pass in the house. We'll continue to watch the developments there on capitol hill with mike viqueira, luke russert who are out there scouring for information to get the very latest for us. You're watching msnbc and our rolling coverage of the fiscal cliff deal. moments. When you lost the thing you can't believe you lost. When what you just bought, just broke. Or when you have a little trouble a long way from home... As an american express cardmember you can expect some help. But what you might not expect, is you can get all this with a prepaid card. Spends like cash. Feels like membership.

=======================================================

>>> I'm right now the house of representatives in recess after recessing for an hour and a half. They are waiting to reconvene to take up the fiscal cliff deal. After the gop meeting, we may learn when the house might vote on the deal and when republicans might amend it. House democrats are meeting on capitol hill with vice president joe biden. He is there to explain the deal he and senate minority leader mitch McConnell brokered and that the senate approved. 
>>> The white house is keeping a close eye on today's developments in the house. Stay with msnbc for more updates. And now back to hardball. 
>>> Two steps forward, one step backward. Let's play "hard ball." 
>> Let me start this last night of the year with this, two steps forward, one step forward, that's the year if you look at it. So many good decisions as a society. We saw the angry faces of reaction to demographic change in the beginning. The people bringing guns to political events. The faces of hatred in the birther mularkey. The dog whistling whether it was about the president or his surrogate, susan rice. Guess what? None of it worked. It just didn't. Who would have known how powerfully americans, america itself could not just reject but repel this nasty appeal. It didn't work. Then we had the horror in newtown, connecticut. Even animals cannot kill 20 victims in ten minutes, for that it takes state of the firepower. David, I want to start with your year, when the big bubble goes up, and we say what does this year all mean? 

[00:02:24]


>> We talked about this throughout the year. I think the campaign was one of the most significant, but also the most ideological campaigns that we've had. You had two different starkly different approaches to america, policies, and america's future put forward b mitt romney and barack obama. One was very progressive and communal in nature, the other is you're on your own, get the government out. Small businesses do everything on their own. The country really was engaged and paid attention. At the end, 53% chose the more progressive fission. It was a hard-fought campaign that shows there is a move in that direction on the country at large. At the same time, while the middle is moving in a progressive direction, I think on the right, you saw this with the republican primary, they're moving further to the right. So a bigger gulf is developing. 
>> Now it's probably critical because people said what they didn't like about romney was his lack of authenticity, he had to go so far to catch up to his crowd on the right and race back across the center line. 
>> Still, even while he was doing that, he did represent an over-arching view of how government should work and where the country should go. 
>> He was waving their flag. 
>> Was a good, positive progressive vote. 
>> Certainly. 
>> Ryan, your thoughts, putting it altogether including the gun violence we saw a few weeks ago, in what was a glowing year in many ways. Id is on to something here. Two things are going on in an encouraging direction we have the majority of the country, i think, turning in a more progressive direction as david suggested here. You see it out here in the state of washington, where we just, you know, legalized marriage for day couples and legalized marijuana, as did colorado. 
>> Put those two together, if you can. 

[00:04:26]


>> At certain weddings they can. 
>> No I think it's the west village at large, the values of manhattan caught on to the country. 
>> At the same time you have a counter reaction to that by people in the right wing who are becoming more and more radicalized. You see that -- I don't want to say the shooting in connecticut was a result of right-wing ideology, but it's interesting that we're hearing reports that this young man's mother was in fact a radicalized survivalist who was spending a lot of time in the woods shooting powerful weaponry she kept around the house. We are a bifurcated country, where the right is going more to the right, and the left is moving a little. 
>> We are not a right wing country, as some people and i worried we might be becoming. On the issue of same-sex marriage, more than half the country, this is the whole united states, say they support it. Stark difference from 1996 when only 27% of the country supported day marriage. That number doubled in a couple of years. I grew up thinking we would never have an african-american president, or even this thing with same-sex marriage. 
>> I think the poll numbers are being driven by basically some -- 
>> I'm trying to create some excitement here. 53%, including mississippi, alabama, louisiana -- 
>> sure. Sure. 
>> Older men, 80-year-old guys, 80-year-old women and the younger kids. 
>> I think it's being driven by younger folks say there's no problem here. And older folks coming around. On economic issues, when you talk about the role of government, taxation, things like that, those are things that can swing back and forth. We'll be fighting about that in the year ahead on spending, entitlements, the fiscal cliff. But you can talk to people on the right and they will say we've lost. We will not get these back. These are advances that will not be reversed. That's a good thing. 

[00:06:50]


>> I think don't ask don't tell is not coming back. When it comes to a key policy question of the economy, whether taxes should be raised on people at the top, the wealthiest americans, an overwhelming majority, 60% say yes, they should. On the question of immigration, the country is not as divided as people might think. More than 60% wanted immigration reform policy. Ron, on all these fronts, people seem to be taking a tolerant view of people in trouble, not a particularly happy view about people with a lot of money that they feel have gotten off scott free. I think that's a fair generalization now. 
>> The 1% does not represent the majority of the country. If you ask 99% of the people do you mind if the wealthiest 1% have to pay more in taxes, they're not going say I hate that. I feel sorry for those rich people who will have to pay more out of their pocket. It's just a different thing. But the fight goes on politically in washington, of course, in terms of taxes and budget and everything else. The assault on the social welfare state continues. The right may give up on day marriage, but they won't give up on tearing medicare and social security apart and privatizing them. That fight is going to continue. 
>> I think there's a lot of americans who would like to get rid of all the welfare programs we have. The whole notion from the right that big government is bad, we have to get rid of big government, that is a popular notion that gets out of the right wing ghetto. President obama says we need government to come together, invest in innovation, health care, the public accepts that. Other times ronald reagan comes along and says government is the problem and people rally behind that. That's a fight. 
>> It's a pendulum, too. 
>> On afghanistan, an issue close to my heart, a war going on for more than 11 years, the american public sick of it. 60% say remove all the troops as soon as possible. 35% say stay in there until afghanistan is stabilized. 11 years and 35% of the people say until it's stabilized. It's not going to get done. 

[00:09:16]


>> No it's not. It's remarkable that the country is decidedly less pro war than a few years ago. We have had these wars that do nothing for the country. We are illegitimate in one case to have a war in the first place. We don't want to be sending our young people off to a central asian hot spot anymore to spend a decade there, what? Building a nation in afghanistan? 
>> Here we go. We can welcome in the new year with iran. That's tough one for even me. The neocons always have a pez dispenser. There is always a war ready to come up. Whether it's iran, you could wait -- here's my next one. 
>> If you want to talk about the good news of the past year, you had romney embracing the neocon VIEW, john McCain talking about eight wars that were ready to roll off the shelves if mitt romney got elected. The public are skeptical about wars thanks to george w. Bush and the invasion of iraq. They looked at that and they didn't fall for it. This election was not decided on foreign policy, but romney tried hard to say president obama was weak, and an appeaser, didn't know anything about national security. The american public did not fall for that bait or trick. 
>> The only way to get his gang of kids in uniform was to photo shop them. He wasn't exactly mr. Military any way. Thank you david corn and ron reagan. 
>>> Coming up, the best of campaign '12. Think of this as a football highlight show the first debate, w go over all the hits and misses with some smart observers. And we have the annual list of the most notable quotes of the year. The list is full of bloopers like legitimate rape and etch-a-sketch. Let's see if you can see which verbal stumble made the list. 

[00:11:22]


>>> And the crazy conspiracy theorys that the right wing spun this season. Here's one from rush, the weather forecaster s manipulated the weather in tampa so the repuans would have to delay their first day of the convention. This is "hardball" the place for politics. Bring out chicken broccoli alfredo. Or best-ever meatloaf. Go to campbellskitchen.Com for recipes, plus a valuable coupon. Campbell's. It's amazing what soup can do. 8???? million veterans living in the united states. We depend on the disabled american veterans to fight for benefits and rights that we earned. Don't forget america's disabled veteran and remember the dav. 

[00:14:51]


>>> It's time for the "hardball" campaign 2012 postgame show. We will start with the highlights, the low lights, and then move on to the general election. Mitt romney summed up the primary season in an infamous call to donors. We had 20 republican debates. It was absolutely nuts. And then the tone was set early. The august 2011 debate when they were assembled on stage, showed their intransigence on taxes. Watch grover norquist's people go to work here. Let's listen. 
>> I'm going to ask a question to everybody on the stage. Say you had a deal, a real spending cuts deal. 10-1, as byron said. Spending cuts to tax increases. Speaker, y're already shaking your head. But who, on this stage, would walk away from that deal? When you raise your hand if you just feel so strongly about not raising taxes, you'd walk away on the 10 to 1 deal. 
>> Joining me right now to review that list of greatness, former rnc chairman michael steele who never had a year like this. Seriously, both msnbc contributors. That was a scene where you come from the roots of the republican party, sir. Was that a good day or a bad day for the republicans when they went out there like lock step? 
>> I think it was a bad day. It was interesting that later on huntsman said, you know, i probably should have raised my hand and said I would have taken the 10 to 1 deal. I think he recognized after the fact that that was a definitive moment where he could have carved out a new space on that page and probably run the campaign free of that baggage. 

[00:16:52]


>> You know, when a bill is passed, you want to be the one that voted for it. Or else vote for the bill when it fails. 
>> He began to lock himself into a position of grover norquisting himself for the whole election. And that played into who he was as a businessman. 
>> It's today's politics. It's like they used to say, you have to be the most segregationist guy in the south. You could never be an inch away from it. Somebody would always go to the right. 
>> I guess you can say that whatever an early primary season crowd claps is going to kill you in october 15th in ohio. 
>> Okay. Let's go back to this. I'm thrilled sometimes at how great politics is. The iowa caucus. It was another unique state. Mitt romney's campaign, the super pac supporting him were on a mission to annihilate him. Just bomb the hell out of him. Newt gingrich was the biggest threat. They destroyed him. Here's a romney-supporting ad destroying newt. 
>> Know what makes barack obama happy? Newt gingrich's backage. 1.6 million. Gingrich not only teamed up with nancy pelosi on global warming, but together, they co-sponsored a bill that gave $60 million a year to a u.N. Program parting china's brutal one-child policy. 
>> There's bee discussion in my head on whether or not ads work in a general election. I don't think they work in presidential elections in october. But those ads out there -- tell me? 
>> Primaries, they are deadly. Particularly in republican primaries. That ad in particular for newt gingrich was devastating. Because it hit -- it was the kitchen sink. It threw it all in there. 

[00:19:00]


>> What did it say about him that you didn't like? 
>> It said he's an insider, he's a washington pal. And, look, he even pals around with nancy pelosi. Didn't we just fire her? 
>> Didn't you see those loving looks that they managed to work with the camera shot? 
>> You know, real quick on that. The interesting thing, if I were newt, I would have pif votded pivoted off that caption of him and nancy together because that's what the people are looking for. That partnership working, getting things done. 
>> But they were talking about global warming. 
>> The other thing about that ad, that was symbolic of the entire mitt romney campaign strategy in the primaries. Which was a take-no-prisoners attack the other guy's strategy. It was not about philosophy. It did nothing to show that mt romney was a committed conservative. It just showed mitt romney had tons of money and some very clever consultants who could carve up anybody in his path. That left him with a lot of making up to do once he secured the nomination. The way he got the nomination as typified by that ad showed weakness in this camp. 
>> Let's go back to the strategy, which it was. Somebody is going to be the republican nominee and that person is going to be obama. Therefore, all you have to do is be that nominee. 
>> That was his theory. As howard just noted, and neil sedaka made famous "making up is hard to do." Once he secured that nomination in early spring, he wanted everybody to fall in line and support him, and it just wasn't there. 
>> Throughout the republican primary, mitt romney pushed himself so far to the right. Especially on immigration, and it was nearly impossible to backtrack on. And, by the way, I don't think he even tried one. It became a defining line on the hard right for romney. Let's listen. 
>> Governor romney, there's one thing I'm confused about. You say you don't want to go and round up people and deport them. But you say they would have to go back to their home country and then apply for citizenship. If you don't deport them, how do you send them home? 

[00:21:03]


>> The answer is self deportation. People decide that they can do better by going home. Because they can't work here because they don't have legal documentation. So we're not going to round people up. 
>> So what was wrong with that? 
>> First of all, the phrase, self deportation -- 
>> was inevitably a headline. 
>> Yes. And managed to summarize everything that people didn't like about mitt romney. 
>> You know, like firing you. 
>> The firing part of it in the sort of cold, technocratic part of it. These are just numbers on a spread sheet. These people will self-deport. And I think the combination of the two the cold heartedness and the cold bloodedness of it played into everybody's view of romney. 
>> Like the bathtub will overflow, and these people will flow out of the country. 
>> It's not just realistic. The titterring and snickering you heard -- 
>> grandma wakes up. You kids are staying, you were born here, I'm out of here. 
>> This was funny. I hope it didn't ruin the guy's life because it was so funny. He was considered a serious contender. Many thought he'd win this thing until some lackluster debate performances gave primary voters second thoughts. And then came this moment, NOVEMBER 9th, BIG DEBATE. Here he s trying to remember the three government agencies he wants to get rid of. Let's watch. 
>> I will tell you, it's three agencies of government when i get there that are gone. Commerce, education, and the -- what's the third one there? Let's see. 
>> You need five. >>Five. Okay. Commerce, education and the -- 
>> epa? 
>> Epa. There you go. 
>> Seriously? Is epa the one you were talking about? 
>> No, sir. We were talking about the agencies of government -- the epa needs to be rebuilt. 
>> You can't name the third one? 

[00:23:04]


>> Agency of government, I would do away with education, commerce, and let's see -- 
>> I can't. The third one, I can't. Sorry. Oops. 
>> He wasn't going to get help from his pals there. That's where they come out, the first thing they do in the debates, they start scribbling on the notes. 
>> Props to john harwood there. 
>> Was he brutal? 
>>> Up next, the right wing's most famous conspiracy theorys about president obama. This is "hardball." ring... Progresso This reduced sodium soup says it may help lower cholesterol, how does it work? You just have to eat it as part of your heart healthy diet. Step 1. Eat the soup. All those veggies and beans, that's what may help lower your cholesterol and -- Well that's easy 
[ Male Announcer ] Progresso. You gotta taste this soup. 

[00:26:57]


>>> Back to "hardball." The final weeks of president obama's first term are upon us. It's hard to remember the bizarre conspiracy theories pushed about the president the last four years. Let's look back at some of the worst first. First, president obama's 2010 trip to india. U.S. Congresswoman michelle obama and others on the right were up in arms about what the trip would cost. 
>> I think we know that just within a day or so, the president of the united states will be taking a trip over to india that is expected to cost the taxpayers $200 million a day. We have never seen a trip at this level before, at this level of excess. It's not a good signal. The american people are quite frankly struggling right now. 
>> For comparison, $200 million a day would have surpassed the daily cost of the war in afghanistan at the time. That nonfactual story about the cost of obama's trip was started by an unnamed source on an indian news website and somehow got into the ether there. We can't talk about conspiracy theories without bringing up rush limbaugh. Remember the first day of the republican convention was canceled due to hurricane isaac, rush floated the idea that president obama was somehow involved with the weather reports, showing that tampa might get hit. 
>> You've got a hurricane coming. The national hurricane center, with a government agency, very hopeful that the hurricane gets near tampa. National hurricane center is obama. National weather service, part of the commerce department. It's obama. Obama is sending in fema in in advance of the hurricane hitting tampa. So the republican convention is nothing but a bunch of tents IN TAMPA, A BUNCH OF RVs AND Stuff making it look like a disaster area before the hurricane even hits there. 
>> Was he laughing at his own bs there? Did you ever think rush limbaugh would warn of us a skewed weather report? Next, an extreme case of preelection fear mongering. What caused judge hed to float the idea of a tax increase in his state in it was about the need to beef up military personnel in case civil war broke out in case president obama got re-elected. Here's judge hedd on that one. 

[00:29:23]


>> I'm thinking worst case scenario, civil civil unrest, civil disobedience, civil war, maybe. We're not talking just a few riots here, demonstrations. We're talking lexington, concord, take up arms and get rid of the guy. He's going to send in u.N. Troops. I don't want him in lubbock county. I'm going to stand in front of ed personnel carriers and say you're not coming in here. The sheriff, I said are you going to back me? He said yeah, I'll back you. 
>> Loony tunes. Finally birtherism with a twist. Here's iowa, u.S. Congressman steve king with how president obama's mother managed to convince us all that her son was born in ii, not in kenya. 
>> I looked into that before he was sworn in for the presidency. We went down into the library of congress and found a microfiche there of two newspapers in hawaii, each of them had published the birth of barack obama. It would have been awfully hard to fraudulently file the birth notice of barack obama being born in hawaii. That doesn't mean there are not some explanations on how they might have announced that by telegram from kenya. 
>> By telegram. I guess she neglected to consider the mother, naming her son barack husein obama might be a minorsetback for her son's future run for the presidency of the united states. Any way, up next, these people are looney. From mitt romney's 47% video to president obama's debate disaster in november, you're watching "hardball" the place for politics. 

[00:34:26]


>>> Welcome back to "hardball." Now that we marked the highlights of the gop primary, let's go into the general campaign. The taped comments to donors down in florida that half the americans are lazy and happy to be on the government dol, it's known as the 47% video. 
>> Never trust the caterers. Any way, joining me, michael steele and howard fineman. Let's look at the 47%. If you are right about this election in terms of power, it's the numbers. The occupy people, 1%. The 1% became something to talk about elite economically. Then the 47%. Anybody who's on any kind of government benrogram. Whether it's disability or retirement or military or pension. Everything was painted as bad. Where did he get that number? 
>> Well, look, you know, this election was all about the numbers. 23 million unemployed, 1 in 6 on welfare. But it was that 47% number that trumped them all at the end of the day. People galvanized around that. Because it was them. It was me. You're talking about me. You're talking about my grandma. U're talking about every-day folks. It really drew out that disconnect between the romney campaign and romney personally and everyone else. 
>> Do you think it's his brand of ideology? 
>> No. 
>> Do you think there's a few people out there pulling the load for everybody else? 
>> No, I think it's a cold, calculated business look. That's how he looks at it. It's like, hey -- 

[00:36:28]


>> I disagree. I think it's his philosophy and I think it showed in that tape. 
>> How do you know it's his philosophy? 
>> I'm guessing. 
>> Mitt romney --ou can't say it's his philosophy because he never told us what that was. 
>> I think he said some nice things at one point. 
>> When he spoke at the democratic national convention, former president bill clinton brought the house down. This was one of the great speeches ever, I think, and it made the case for reelecting president obama in a way the candidate himself never got able to do, even to the end. Let's listen to big bill at his best. 
>> Are we better off than we were when he took office? 
[ Cheers ] then, listen t. Listen to this. Everybody's forgotten. Everybody's forgotten when president barack obama took office, the economy was in freefall, it had just shrunk nine full percent in gdp. We were losing 750,000 jobs a month. Are we doing better than that today? The answer is yes. 
>> You know, I was thinking back to the fairy tale remark he made four years before that hurt him more than obama. But the guy's showmanship with the gesticulation, the hands, the whole dinemism, the way he presents himself. 
>> Earlier this year, I wrote oh, who needs conventions what are they for, anyway? They're for moments like that. I was on the floor at that moment. 
>> It worked in the hall. 
>> It was one of the most memorable things I've seen live in a hall or anywhere. That was bill clinton at the summation of his career. That was everything he learned about showmanship, about telling a story, and about how to make the case for the president. He made it so simply, so clearly, so logically that you wondered why the supposed great speechifier, barack obama, couldn't do it. That's probably because the kind of case he had to make, somebody other than the president had to make. If the president himself says, you know we were in a terrible situation when I came in, it doesn't sound as compelling. 

[00:38:38]


>> I had a moment like that up in new hampshire when clinton was rug the first time. He's in new hampshire, he already gotten through the draft letter, gotten through the problem with the girlfriend way back when. The draft letter was killing him. Then he went out to these field houses in high school gyms, and he spock in the round. And he would go on the last question in the room he'd answer. And rick hertzburg said to me nobody in our generation can do that. Only he can to that. 
>> What also impressed me about that, I was covering that very same series of events was his will. Bill clinton's will to succeed. 
>> He wouldn't quit. That's what separates him from the losers. You take the worst falls in the world and come running back. Any way, another turning point that threatened to derail this campaign, it was purely negative, though it was a pretty good day for mitt romney. The president's listless performance which he says caused me to have a stroke afterwards, I was so appalled by it. Here's part of his closing argument, if you want to call it that, an argument. Let's listen to president, a bad night for him. 
>> You know, four years ago, i said I'm not a perfect man and and I wouldn't be a perfect president. And that's probably a promise that governor romney thinks I've kept. But I also promised that I'd fight every single day on behalf of the american people, the middle class, all those striving to get into the middle class. I've kept that promise. If you'll vote for me, then i promise I'll fight just as hard in the second term. 
>> I don't know. I don't know what to say even now. The man has so much juice and excitement about him. His brain is always working on two or three levels when you're with him. Here he is, I want off this channel. I want off the stage. 
>> I think a lot of it had to do with how he feels personally about mitt romney. The idea that he was on the stage with him he felt was just beneath him. This guy was someplace else. Yeah it was his anniversary, but politically, he was thinking why am I dealing with tier two. It showed. 

[00:40:39]


>> Let's look at the impact of hurricane sandy and the pictures we saw on television, right before the election. We saw the president of the united states, a democrat, facing a really tough re-election situation, along with a pretty popular governor of new jersey. Here he is, the president, at a press conference withew jersey governor chris christie, october 31st. Week before the election. 
>> We are not going to tolerate red tape, we are not going to tolerate bureaucracy. I instituted a 15-minute rule on my team. You return everybody's phone call within 15 minutes. If it's the mayor's, the governor's, county officials, if they need something, we figure out a way to say yes. 
>> Whatever he said, there's so much devastation in the new york area, new jersey. It's worse than we've thought in the beginning. It just keeps getting worse and worse. But that picture, I think it was just two people of different parties. And the biggest applause I've heard in the campaign was can't we work together? 
>> That's what people wanted all along throhout this entire campaign was seeing the republicans and democrats, conservatives and liberals coming together around a common goal. 
>> Why do you think that bipartisanship was not as strong? 
>> I think that was there. And I think to chris christie's credit, he galvanized the moment to action. But you saw a cooperation. You saw his government and the federal government coming together to solve people's problems. 
>> And they addressed them in work clothes. They had the fleece. 
>> Had the fleece on. Sleeves rolled up. 
>> You are the best. I love politics. Agree with you. 
>> I'm breaking this story here. Certain things thought when people rise to the occasion, they did the right thing. And I love bill clinton coming to save his old rival. And he did. Anyway, thank you, michael steele. Thank you howard fineman. Up next, from etch-a-sketch to legitimate rape to 47%. Yale university hat list of the most notable political quotes of the year. Which quote tops it? That's ahead. And this is "hardball" the place for politics. lisa, quit. I honestly loved smoking, and I honestly didn't think I would ever quit.

[ Male Announcer ] ALONG WITH SUPPORT, Chantix is proven to help people quit smoking. It reduces the urge to smoke. It put me at ease that you could sme on the first week. 
[ Male Announcer ] SOME PEOPLE HAD CHANGES In behavior, thinking or mood, hostility, agitation, depressed mood and suicidal thoughts or actions while taking or after stopping chantix. If you notice any of these stop taking chantix and call your doctor right away. Tell your doctor about any history of depression or other mental health problems, which could get worse while taking chantix. Don't take chantix if you've had a serious allergic or skin reaction to it. If you develop these stop taking chantix and see your doctor right away as some can be life-threatening. If you have a history of heart or blood vessel problems, tell your doctor if you have new or worse symptoms. Get medical help right away if you have symptoms of a heart attack. Use caution when driving or operating machinery. Common side effects include nausea, trouble sleeping and unusual dreams. With chantix and with the support system it worked. It worked for me. 
[ Male Announcer ] ASK YOUR DOCTOR IF CHANTIX Is right for you. 

[00:46:13]


>>> We're back. 2012 is coming to a close. Let's look back at a few of the most memorable quotations. Everything from the historic, to the infamous to the absurd. For the seventh year, fred shapiro has released his list of the top ten quotes. Which ones will stand the test of time? You be the judge. Joining me right now is a columnist for bloomburview. Gentlemen, get in your starting gates. Here's the number one, actually, the number seven quote of the year, it happened in march while the republican primary fight was still going on. Romney had been pushed to the far right on a host of issues, and most were asking could he pivot back to the center in the general election? Then one of his top advisers said this. Let's watch. 
>> He hit a reset button for the fall campaign. Everything changes. It's almost like an etch-a-sketch. You can shake it up, we start all over again. 
>> I've never seen a guy just give away the signals. Here's our secret plan for the general election. We're going to pretend we're moderates. And there, he did. 
>> He not only gave away the plan, they had to then cancel the plan and they didn't actually pivot to the center until that first debate many months later. So what that etch-a-sketch comment did was it almost cost them the election right there. It prevented them from scampeng back to the middle in time. On issues like immigration and it didn't allow romney the running room to win the election. 
>> He also said I don't believe a word I spoke since I began running for president. Here's one for you. If one comment crystallized the overwhelming trouble the republican party had with the american women voters, it was this. Take a look at number 6. 
>> First of all, from what i understand from doctors, that's really rare. If it's a legitimate rape, the female body has ways to try to shut that whole thing down. 

[00:48:16]


>> I love the double whammy this guy. If -- let's start with the first part -- if it's a legitimate rape. What did that mean? 
>> Well, what it meant was absolutely unjustifiable. And it was the reason for the potential for todd aiken to go off the reservation on an issue that was one of the democrats seizing on and prepared to hit him on. Sort of shows why he was such a weak candidate, and why democrats wanted him to be the nominee, to the point where they advertised democratic super pacts in his primary for the republican nomination to run for senate AGAINST claire McCaskell in missouri as it said todd aiken is too conservative. He's never voted to raise taxes. He is opposed to abortion. And republican primary voters there in missouri said hey, this sounds like our kind of guy. So democrats kind of meddled in that primary. They got the candidate that they wanted and he self destructed just as they wanted, making what should have been a tough reelection fight for claire McCASKELL KIND OF A CAKE WALK. 
>> As the royal mounted miss always say, we always get our MONEY, AND claire McCaskill got her man. 
>>> The president bounced back with two strong showings. Here's a memorable line from the third debate that ranked as the number five quote of the year. Take a look. 
>> You mentioned the navy, for example. We had fewer ships than we did in 1916. Well, governor, we also have fewer horses and bayonets. Because the nature of our military has changed. We have these things called aircraft carriers where planes land on them. We have the ships that go under water, nuclear submarines. 
>> Talk about patronizing. Meanwhile, perhaps the most memorable moment from the debates occurred in the second debate. 
>> The president said on the day after the attack, he went into the rose garden and said this was an act of terror. 

[00:50:27]


>> You said in the rose garden the day after the attack it was an act of terror. It was not a spontaneous demonstration. That what you're saying? 
>> Please proceed, governor. 
>> John, there is so much to that phrase. Please proceed. Was that constitutional law class? 
>> I love that. 
>> What was that? Was that "the good wife"? I don't know what it was. It was a courtroom scene there, I think. 
>> He just led him right into the trap. And that was very harmful to mitt romney because not only did it take benghazi off the table, it basically took foreign policy off the table. It seemed like in the third debate that romney barely showed up because he had basically ceded all of foreign policy to the president. That's what the polls were showing. But also, it's something that you very rarely see in a debate, chris, which is a clean kill. You've got lloyd benson doing it to dan quayle. Two or three other examples in the entire history of presidential debates. And this was the perfect one where romney was very well prepared on many other issues, was taken by his staff to a place that he shouldn't have been, where he is trying to score points on an issue where he shouldn't have been trying to score. 
>> I could just add to this. 
>> Go ahead, what made that so effective is he wasn't even the one who delivered the sort of kill line. It was candy crowley, the moderator of the debate. Because of what romney said is that obama did not use those words was so demonstrably false that the moderator stepped in at the time and fact checked him and said you're wrong. That was so devastating. 
>> Well said, well said. It was critical. He is right, john. The next quote caused the internet to blow up. Twitter instantly went wild. It's the number two line of the year. Let's take a listen. E took a concerted effort to good out and find women who had backgrounds that could be qualified to become members of our cabinet. I went to a number of women's groups and said can you help us find folks. They brought us whole binders full of women. 
>> What did yale decide was the quote of the year? This probably won't shock you. In some ways it defined what the election is all about. Let's watch. 

[00:52:34]


>> There are 47% of the people who will vote for the president no matter what. All right? There are 4 % who are with him, who are dependent on him, and believe that they're victims, who belief the government has the responsibility to care for them. So my job is not to worry about those people. I'll never -- they should take first responsibility and care for their lives. 
>> Agreed, john, agreed, ken, that this was the line that put him away? 
>> Not only was this unbelievably divisive in a country that likes to think of itself as one country, but it was critically important that it was caught on surreptitious video. If this is something he had said in public, it would have been a big gaffe, but not as big as seeing it on that video where the voter is thinking ah-ha, now I'm seeing the real mitt romney, not the one in the packaging. 
>> And not just that, the setting, that he was speaking to wealthy donors whoe could be candid with. It was like the true mitt romney talking to his people in this setting. Just so illustrative of what people's preconceptions, worst preconception of who mitt romney was. 
>> You know, a really good lawyer in washington to make your point told me other day in criminal cases, the worst thing that can happen in a criminal trial is just to hear the voice of your client on tape there is something about caught on tape. Ever since nixon, I don't know. What you don't want to be caught on tape. Thank you. Merry christmas, happy new year to both of you guys. Happy new year. When we return, let me finish with my thoughts on the year that was. You're watching "hardball," the place for politics. ?????? ??????

>>> Let me end tonight and the year with this. I said it was a year of two steps forward, one step backward. A reasonable judgment about america in 2012 is we are a more diverse people than some imagined. We are a country more tolerant of our diversity than i imagined. Was it a good year for america? My answer is yes. As a country, we backed the rights of women, increasingly backed those of gay people. We voted as a people who believe not just in life and liberty, but the pursuit of happiness. From a distance of 236 years, we were very loyal to the opening words of the declaration of independence. I never believed president barack obama had a second term in the bag. The night of his first debate with governor romney I thought that he was on his way out of town, be he wasn't. His vice president out-battled his rival. The president himself came back to show that he was not a man to be taken down twice. Most important, he got some breaks. The supreme court upheld health care. The jobless rate dropped below 8%. Mitt romney showed himself a man at home with his fellow rich out on a limb when trying to be someone he isn't, a right-wing simpleton. We look forward to a new year and a administration with a significantly progressive president. America isn't a hard right country, intolerant, resentful of its new countrymen and women. It's progressive leanings who has rejected reversions to the policies it holds responsible for the country's current difficulties. It likes its president, it roots for his success and believes strongly that america will win again because of its deep resilience. Well can change. We are changing. And when we see failure, when we see heart, we are to the afraid to change. There's an old line in the movies "i learned that people only true pay attention to what they discover for themselves. In the morning hours of newtown, connecticut, in the horror of 20 young faces we learned what must be done because we saw what was being done to our children and grandchildren if we didn't. We gave up cigarettes, which gave us pleasure, because we discovered the damage they can do, because of the horror they can do. We should be able to give up semiautomatic rifles. And that's "hardball" for now. Thanks for being with us.

>>> Democrats won't soon forget the acquaintances they made in 2012 that propelled president obama to four more years, but what's in store for a second term, and what will the president be able to accomplish before leaving the white house? 
>>> Recent history shows some highs and lows for second term presidents. What can president obama learn from the mistakes and big breaks that shaped the country for the last 30 years? 
>>> And a who's who to keep your eyes on for the coming year and years. Will new names emerge as the leading voices of their parties, while old familiar ones still drive the early jockeying for the next presidential fight. 
>>> Happy holiday and new year. Hello from washington. This is a special year-end decision of "the daily rundown" and also a preview. I'm chuck todd, and all this hour we're going to look at what lessons we got from 2012, how power could shift in 2014, and who is taking the long hard look for the bid for 2016. Maybe we'll even slip in something for 2015 just for kicks. How did president obama weighed down by a jobless rate higher than any incumbent seeking re-election since f.D.R. Win 332 electoral votes, sweep eight of the nine battleground states, and even have his party pick up senate seats to get to 55? As the republican picks up the pieces and looks ahead to 2016, here are four lessons that 2016 hopefuls from both parties might want to keep in mind. Lesson one, you don't define yourself, your opponent will do it for you. Romney let the president's early attacks on his personal wealth and business background go largely unanswered. Romney's campaign argued after a long, expensive primary they had to choose how to spend at the time what was limited funds and adds about what romney would do as president tested better they claim that bio-spots or defenses of his personal record. In the end obama beat romney by ten points. On the economic values question that was this, which candidate is more in touch with people like you. 53% said romney's policies would favor the rich. Just 10% said that about the president's policies. Romney, the first republican nominee in the history of our nbc-wall street journal poll to go into his convention with this personal rating under water and in his campaign with a painful number. Just 47% of votes viewing him positively. The obama campaign was also able to get more bang for the buck because they bought ads early. 

[00:02:54]


>> The obama campaign purchased it way ahead of time. Romney bought it the week of. Lesson two, the republican brand needs a hard look. The gop's favorable rating has been under water for two years, since december 2010, and, in fact, if you take that out, it's been nearly five years. In our final poll, full poll before the election, just 36% of registered voters said they had a positive view of the republican party, 43% held a negative view. The democratic party's favorable rating was in positive territory, though just barely, at 42%-40%. More than 20 primary debates put harsh republican rhetoric on immigration on full display. The todd aiken, richard murdoch wing damaged women in th party. Now they debate whether to moderate or modernize, it has to repair its image, particularly among key groups. That leads us to lesson three. Demographics are destiny. Romney won a higher percentage of the white vote than any candidate since ronald reagan in 1984. He beat obama by 20 points. 59-39 among white voters. By 14 points among white women. By five points among self-described independents. He won all these groups by more than george w. Bush did in 2004, but he lost the election by a wider margin than john kerry. Why? Because the composition of the electorate changed. As the obama campaign predicted more than a year ago, the white portion in the electorate dropped from 74% in 2008 to 72% in 2012. The president carried nearly eight in ten non-white voters including an astounding 71% of latinos. 73% of asian voters and a whopping 93% of black voters. It remains a really question whether the democratic mom knee in 2016 right back able to hold the obama coalition together, which also includes young voters, but the republican party is right to be re-examining its relationship with minorities. Finally, lesson four. Don't ignore the data. The polls matter. More of them are right than wrong. Though public polling in the swing states consistently showed the president ahead, the romney campaign sincerely believed until election day that romney would win. Why? Romney's pollsters assumed the electral would be a little wider and a little older than it turned out to be. The entsiasm numbers did favor them, but they didn't have enough voters. More than any cycle in recent memory, many republicans bought into an alternative polling universe where the vast majority of public polls were the product of a conspiracy created by some media pollster mastermind determined to depress republican voting. In 2016 much of the emphasis in both parties will be to match and improve on the obama campaign's data driven technological juggernaut. The same time one lesson was 2012, the republican bubble is don't ignore the data that is available to anyone with a computer. Second, it's known as the second term curse. American president successfully wins re-election only to have rough rides thanks to overreached and sometimes soing relations with congress, personnel problems, unforeseen external events and, of course, scandal. There's always an issue for second term presidents. In his first post-election news conference, the president himself acknowledged that his predecessors had their versions of second term struggles. 

[00:06:16]


>> I don't presume that because I won an election that everybody suddenly agrees with me on everything. I'm more than familiar with all the literature about presidential overreach in second terms. 
>> I wonder if you have drawn any lessons on why that's so. 
>> The things that derail a second term are basically three. One is. 
>> Sometimes the president thez he has more of a mandate than he does and tried to do too much in the absence of cooperation. And the third is sometimes a president essentially just runs out of steam. 
>> In a november of 1972 after two weeks of reflection at camp david president richard nixon told reporters my study of elections in this country is that second terms almost inevitably are downhill. Yes, richard nixon said that in 1972. After a string of legislative successes in his first term and after narrowly winning a second term as president, president bush claimed a mandate. 
>> When you win, there is a feeling that the people have spoken and embraced your point of view, and that's what i intend to tell the congress. I earned capital in the campaign, political capital, and now I intend to spend it. 
>> Spend it, he did. Just 16 months later bush made this stark admission to the press corps. 
>> Just after the 2004 election, you seemed -- you have claimed an enviable balance of political capital and a strong mandate. Would you make that claim today? Do you still have that? 
>> I would say I'm spending that capital on the war. 
>> Not only did plummeting support for the iraq war erode bush's ability to drive his second term agenda, but he aels overreached with the social security privatization push. His efforts on immigration reform then collapsed under the weight of the other issues. The administration bungled the response for hurricane katrina and relations with congress soured to the point that when bush nominated harriet myers to the supreme court, republicans didn't even fall in line. Many conservatives privately and publicly called her unqualified. After three weeks bush was forced to withdraw her nomination. In december of 2008 shortly before he left office bush's job approval rating had suj to a miserable 27%. Congress had often been a thorn in the side of second term presidents. It's a real question whether president obama will be able to forge a closer working relationship with congress this time around. Then, of course, there's the second term scandal. Clinton's sec term dominated basically ended after a year because the lewinsky scandal began. Impeachment then followed that completely derailed any agenda he hoped to push in that second four years. 

[00:09:12]


>> I have to go back to work on my state of the union speech, and I worked on it until pretty late last night, but I want to say one thing to the american people. I want you to listen to me. Going to say this again. I did not have sexual relations with that woman, ms. Lewinsky. 
>> Though ronald reagan pushed through a tax overhaul in his second term, he also became embroiled in the iran-contra affair. 
>> A few months ago I told the american people I did not trade arms for hostages. My heart and my best intentions still tell me that's true, but the facts and the evidence tell me it is not. 
>> There is a bright side. If lincoln hadn't had a second term, he wouldn't have won the civil war. Reagan's place in history was smepted by the beginnings of the end of the cold war, and without a second term f.D.R. Would be remembered as the president who didn't end the great depression. Still, second terms, they don't last four years. They're shorter than that. How long will obama have? Is he aware that his second term domestically only lasts about a year to 18 months? Finally, political junkies know we don't have to wait until 2016 or even 2014 for our next fix. Just next year we've got blockbuster races for governor in two big states, virginia and new jersey. In new jersey it's the clintons verse the tea party. As former democratic national committee chairman and clinton LOYALIST terry McCull uf takes on virginia's republican attorney general, he who put himself front and center in the multi-state chal toning the health care law, is, of course, a tea party favorite and a favorite of social conservatives, but money and the backing of the clirns didn't do THE TRIP for McCull off last time around. He lost badly in a three-way democratic primary the first time he tried tore governor. Key question this time. Which flawed candidate wins this race? Or supposedly flawed candidate. McCULLOUGH IS HOPING TO BREAK This curse. The party that wins the presidency loses the state's gubernatorial election the next year. It's never waivered. 2001 after president bush was elected current democratic senator mark warner defeated a republican, mark early, state attorney general. 52% of the vote. In 2005 after bush's re-election, tim caine beat former attorney general terry kilgore. bob McDonnell won by 17 points during the first year in office. In the off the air election with turnout expected to be about 40%, the electral is likely to be older, and more conservative than it was in november in virginia. Will it be conservative enough to elect ken? We'll see. Moving on to new jersey. By the way, speaking of the terry McCullough campaign, if are you thinking about working on hillary's presidential campaign, apparently you're supposed to send your resume to him. I'm not fully joke about that. In new jersey where the governor's race is all about one man, chris christie, and 2016. He hopes to scare off any serious democratic competition while building a platform for future political success. Both christie's run for a second term and his presidential ambitions will be shaped in how he manages hurricane sandy's recovery effort. Will christie who familiesly declared now is not my time in the fall of 2011 make moves in 2013 towards a presidential bid? Watch the garden state governor's race for clues. I can tell you one thing. People close to christie believe the biggest mistake mitt romney made in 2006 was not trying to seek a second term in massachusetts, trying to avoid that. They believed they are best shot at becoming president in 2016 is winning re-election in 2013. We have a gaggle of campaign verlts and political junkies joining us this hour. Stephanie cutter, kevin madden from the campaign trail of their respective campaigns. Obama and romney. Plus, chris elisa and perry bacon will all be here next. We made a clis, checked it twice, and now we're going beyond hillary and jeb. We'll have the daily rundown's politicians to watch in the new year. You're watching a special edition of "the daily rundown" only on msnbc. snapshot progressive, but don't just listen to me. Listen to these happy progressive customers. I plugged in snapshot, and 30 days later, I was saving big on car insurance. With snapshot, I knew what I could save before I switched to progressive. The better I drive, the more I save. I wish our company had something this cool. You're not filming this, are you? Aw! Camera shy. Snapshot from progressive. Test-drive snapshot before you switch. Visit progressive.Com today. 

[00:16:35]


>>> Call it "the daily rundown's" dirty dozen. The people we'll be watching closely over the next 12 poz. Some of them are already household names, and the rest we expect will be pretty soon. Here's the list I threw out there on the democratic side. Vice president biden, secretary of state hillary clinton, senator michael bennett, governor jerry brown, incoming senators elizabeth warren and angus king who is an inpent, but will caucus with the democrats on the republican side. We have governor nicki hailey, congressman paul ryan, marco rubio, former governor jeb bush and soon to be former senator jim demint joining me now. Our end of the year gaggle. Msnbc contributor and managing editor of post politics.Com chris, msnbc contribute and political etd tore for the greater.Com harry bacon, steph cutter was on president obama's lee election campaign, and henry madden was an aid viesor for mitt romney's campaign. Happy new year. We asked all of you to pick. I threw out my dozen, and all of you -- I asked you to pick two that you were going to -- again, we're not going to do the 2016 conversation now, but we'll do it in a few minutes. Chris -- 
>> moving on. 
>> Of my dozen, who were the two that you are thinking, 2013? 
>> I'm a little nerdy and focused on, you know, down ballot races. I did pick michael bennett, the colorado senator, because he is going to be -- he is the new head of the democratic senatorial campaign committee, which means he is tasked with trying to, again, keep a democratic senate majority. Going to be difficult. You have 20 democratic seats up. You only have ten republican seats up. 
>> He wants to be senate majority leader someday. That's why he is doing it. 
>> They asked him two years ago, and he said no. He said yes this time. 
>> Why pence. 
>> He spent time in congress. He is now the governo of indiana. I think he is a guy who we underrate in terms of his influence. We've seen in places like ohio, florida, wisconsin, how governors, particularly republican governors, can have are real influence. Pence is a conservative who is a believer, and I think he is going to push an agenda that will kind of sort of outline 2013. 

[00:18:45]


>> All right. Perry, you picked two governors. 
>> Jerry brown really important. First time ever since 1933 california's super majority, meaning two-thirds of the members of the house and the senate are democrats. Jerry brown and the democrats can do whatever they want to. We have basically one party deposit in the biggest state in the country, and I'm careus what does that mean. 
>> How does he use it? 
>> Kind of the liberal panacea. 
>> Then you went with a conservative potential rising star out in south carolina who is struggling. 
>> Niki haley is struggling in her state. Her approval rating is lower than president obama's in south carolina right now. She's this big national figure. The republicans are looking for diverse voices, and she is one of the most leading ones. I'm careus to see what she does going forward. 
>> Stephanie, your picks were? One was predictable. One to me was unpredictable. 
>> Well, I picked elizabeth warren who is my home state new senator. Of course, she has senator kennedy's seat, so it's very important to me. I think she's probably the most high profile appreciate freshman senator. 
>> Without a doubt. 
>> Probably since hillary clinton, right? 
>> Yes. I think you're right. I think she's coming in in the same way. Keeping her head down. Looking for people to work with. Reach across the aisle. Moderating some of the things. 
>> Is this a stepping stone for her? 
>> I don't know. I don't want to guess, but I do know that there are some great things that she can accomplish there. Potentially, you knowing, it's rumored that she would be on the senate banking committee, her area of expertise. She's been a consumer watchdog. This will be interesting to watch. 
>> To watch her, and she's going to butt heads with democrats. That's what's going to be interesting on some of these things. Then your other pick sh. 
>> Paul ryan. 
>> Yeah. 
>> You know, yol I don't feel as a democrat it's somebody I've been watch aing long time. I think he came out of this race with a good reputation. I think that, you know, he has a lot of opportunity this year. He is known as a reform ner the party. The republican party is doing a lot of introspection of what they need to do to address the changing demographics in this country, and he has an opportunity to really step up. 
>> How does he do it in the house, which is always a little more difficult. 

[00:20:47]


>> He is a leader in the house, and he is known as being idealogical. This is an opportunity for him to open it up a little bit. 
>> All right, kevin. You got the big two. 
>> Well, I think marco rubio is one of the people I picked because I think as to perry's point, people are looking for a new diverse voices inside the republican party, and I think whether he likes it or not, marco rubio is going to become a national figure in that regard, and he will be emblem attic of the republicans' abilities and their effort to reach out to newer audiences. Many conservatives are going to use marco rubio as a vessel for what they believe is rebuilding the party over the next. 
>> His first test will be getting immigration over the -- how does he do it and make it happen? How does he navigate it and still stick? 
>> How does he go beyond it? How sde not get pigeon holed as the hispanic republican and, instead, become somebody who can become a national leader. 
>> Hillary clinton, what does she do in 2013? 
>> Hillary clinton is -- whether she likes it or not as well is, like, this clinton industrial news complex. Everything she does sparks speculation, sparks, you know, all of these incredible, you know, obsessing over whether it's not -- it's a positioning for this year or positioning for another year, a positioning against somebody. I think that's just something that's going to happen. A lot of people will be looking at whether she can inherit the obama success. 
>> Joe biden whoshg the guy has to figure out how to naf gate the clinton industrial news conference. I like this. Angus king, the independent, committee be ab independent? That's what I'm going to be watching in 2013. Jeb bush, who may be the transitional leader of the republican party wlshgs he likes it or not, and then there's jim demint. Do y buy ceo of the conservative movement? 
>> I think it's very hard for jim demint to go into -- I think it's in many ways sort of like this aol-time warner merger. It makes a lot of sense on paper. The question is will he be able to overcome some of the institutional challenges that each have. Jim deminute going outside of the senate into something that's out in the think tank world. We're going to have more of this. We'll have more from the gaggle coming up. Plus, the six-year itch. It's a bed rom of conventional wisdom. Is it just a made-up thing? Second term president, supposedly struggling in his second midterm. We'll let you know whether we think it's real or simply a coincidence. The deep dive is next. First, a special trivia question. Who was the first president and who was the most recent president to officially start a term on a sunday? The answer and more is coming up on "the daily rundown." Coming up. mommy having. Mommy's having a french fry. Yes she is, yes she is.

[ Male Announcer ] COULD'VE HAD A V8. 100% vegetable juice, with three of your daily vegetable servings in every little bottle. Zirchlg as we get closer to the next midterm electrics, you'll likely hear more about the so-called six-year itch. It's a theory that the party controlling the white house loses big in a two-term president's second midterm. Today we're taking a deep dive into whether the six-year itch is real or simply a coincidence that just happened a few times. It's a look back at history, if you will. We'll show what you we're looking at. At the last five two-term presidents. Truman, eisenhower, reagan, clinton, and bush. We're including truman because even though he wasn't elected in 1944, he took over after f.D.R. Died just three months into his term in 1945. President nixon is out because he resigned before the second midterm shall abbinging. Let's put up the numbers. In truman's second term, let's take a look here. As you can see, in that midterm of 1950 is democratic party lost 28 seats in the house. Six in the senate. Ike's second midterm in 1958 the gop got wiped out, losing 48 house seats. 13 senate seats. Reagan, 1986. Republicans lost five seats in the house, eight seats in the senate. Not so bad. I'll tell you more about that in a minute. It did cost the republicans control of the senate m process. President clinton, of course, is the big outliar here, if you'll recall. He didn't lose anything in that second midterm. Winning five house seats for his party. Staying even in the senate. Eight years later in 2006 president bush got hammered. Republicans lost 30 seats in the house, six in the senate, but, of course, more importantly, control of both houses were gone from the republicans. A couple of things to note here. The 1988 election under president clinton marked the only time a sitting two-term president saw any kind of gains in his second midterm in the modern era. Two-term presidents typically have one really bad midterm and one not so bad. For instance are eisenhower awes party did much better in his midterm than his second. Truman's party did the opposite. It was much worse in 1946 than it was in 1950. Reagan split decision after losing big in the house and gaining a senate seat in 1982. Republicans lost seven senate seats in 1986 and lost senate seats in 1986 and the control, but did better in the house. Let's take look at our next one. The two most recent examples of midterms. Bill clinton's democrats lost 54 house seats and eight senate seats in 1994 before turning the tables about those surprise wins in 1998. Both parties said in the 1998 result was due in part, maybe in whole, to the public backlash against republicans who seem too focused on the lewinsky scandal rather than govrping. President bush saw the opposite. Had a great first midterm. Not so great second one. Two republican midterms there. Gaining ground in both chambers under bush in 2002. A 9/11 halo effect, if you will, before losing big in 2006. What's behind the truth of the theory of the six-year itch? It seems logical that the political pendulum would swing from one party to the other over the course of six years. There are exten waiting circumstances that make it hard to draw any sweeping conclusions. By the time his second midterm rolled around hae truman was into intervention in korea. A controversial effort that republicans used against his party. Eisenhower was saddled with the midterms of 1958. U.S. Unemployment had spiked to nearly 7%. That was double what it had been when he was first elected six years earlier. During the 2006 midterm the u.S. Was three years into the iraq war and facing heavy sectarian violence. A combination that put -- what are the lebs for president obama and the democrats? Should they worry about a six-year itch? I say maybe not so much. Here's why. Because in 2010 the party lost 63 seats in the house, six seats in the senate. President obama famously called it a shellacking and it was. There's reason to think will he do better. He limits his losses like reagan did or even add seats in the house like clinton. President obama is almost guaranteed to do better in the house. Very hard frankly to do worse than what he did in his first midterm. Then democrats have this anecdote. Basically hold on to the control of the senate. President can declare partial victory for that. That was the importance of democrats adding two senate seats. Sitting at 55. Republicans had to win big winning six senate seats is big, and that's what they have to do to get control in 2014. The gaggle will be back right after the break. The good, the bad, and the ugly of the 2012 ad season. They made us laugh. Some made us cringe. Which ones made people go out and actually vote. You are watching a special edition of "the dell rundown" only on msnbc. ???????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????? ???????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????? ?????? o beautiful for spacious skies for amber waves of grain for purple mountains majesty above the fruited plain america, america, god shed his grace on thee and crown thy good ?????? 

[00:34:55]


>> our gaggle here was almost unanimous many naming that ad as one of the most memorable and effective ads of the 2012 campaign. That's saying something. In a race where nearly $1 billion was spent on television advertising alone. Just in the presidential race. It was tough to stand out. 
>> Both of you picked that ad as the most effective and both of you on the democratic side -- you both picked the most effective ad on the republican side. Here it is. 
>> He treated. You tried. It's okay to make a change. 
>> So I haut that was interesting. It's almost like you're respecting the other's work. Ken, you picked the america the beautiful. 
>> I remember when that ad came out. It was previewed on a sunday morning. Stephanie and I were both on "face the nation." I was actually -- first time i saw it while we were on air, and I remember while it's playing i was thinking that is a very good ad. I mean, it's oftentimes if we use a candidate's against him. I had never heard him using his singing against him. By the way, they used it again and again. Sflo if you say the 2012 campaign, it is very likely you will get someone singing an off key version of "america the beautiful where i". 
>> The big problem we had and i think what the obama campaign tried to use to their advantage was that this is -- mitt romney is not somebody who you can identify with. With the heart of that ad was that nobody watching that ad has accounts in the caymens. It just seemed, you know, something with them that they could not identify with. It made it their point much easier. 
>> It was a negative ad with a light touch. In a way -- that is always the most effective negative ad. That little light touch. 
>> Here he is singing about america the beautiful. Then, you know, it forces you to turn and look at the tv and then on the tv you see just it scroll down caymen island investments, swiss bank account. It was the perfect -- if he believes in america, why is he investing overseas? 

[00:36:59]


>> Let's jump to the rnc ad, you thought that was the most effective attack ad on the president, and you were wondering where did it go? 
>> Right. That was the argument that we were worried most about. If you look at the democrats consolidated. Republicans consolidated. There's this small segment in the middle. Many of whom who had voted for the president, but they weren't ready to say -- 
>> and who liked him. 
>> They hadn't turned away from him, but we didn't have their support. It was the perfect message to them. It's okay to make a change. He tried. You tried. Let's move forward. 
>> Why didn't you use that? 
>> I mean, it was something i think that buoyed the president, but the personal likability factor, but that people felt like this was something that if we were going to focus on the economy, it was something to go out there. I think that was a mistake, and stephanie has pointed out which is that we didn't do it in a broad and sustained away. We did it in precise hits here and there. 
>> To the president, I thought the megtive ads were in bounds. Where things weren't inbound was on the senate level. I have a best of what I thought were the -- some of the most negative ads of the cycle. Here it is. 
>> Carmona is not who he seems. He has issues with anger, with ethics, and with women. 
>> With a history of bar brawls, altercations, and road rage, a trail of unpaid debts and tax liens, one of the worst attendance records in congress this year. 
>> Mitt romney made over $100 million by shutting down our plant, and devastated our lives. Turns out thatn we built that stage, like building my own coffin. 
>> Debbie spent so much american money, you borrow more and more from us. Your economy get very weak. Ours get very good. We take your jobs. Thank you. 
>> Perry, that was sort of the best of. The brutality -- the sort of -- there was a hackishness to the negative ads. 
>> There was a ishness. On the presidentiaes the priority usa ads were at times very aggressive, very -- 

[00:39:03]


>> right on the line there. 
>> I thought they actually did a good job of playing a good message. They were the hardest possible mitt romney outsources things. If you look in ohio, I think those ads made a difference there, and they were useful. 
>> Let's remember, though, on the negative front, that that connie mack ad that bill nelson thought he could lose. 
>> They just buried him. They didn't but it in there, but he had a bar fight with ron gamt. 
>> He was t the time. 
>> Right. 
>> You are an idiot college kid. 
>> I always say in campaigns we focus so much on the presidential, but you can only really hate those who you know extremely well, and it's like the pta board race is always really, you whan I mean? The lower down you get where you actually know more of the people, the presidential race sdsh m and barack obama know each other in the vaguest. 
>> I have seen people in younkers, new york, that are ten times worse. 
>> I would say it's the hardest thing this year, and you were talking about it, is breaking through, and you were talking about your ad tha broke through virally is big bird. 
>> Yes. Actually, without my money behind it. Five million people. Pooh big bird never aired on television. 
>> It did. It was part of what we called our rotation, but just even putting out there five million people went to our website to look at it. 
>> No offense no big bird. Here's the most viral ad of 2012. 
>> Together we can do this. We can take this country back. ?????? I am america ?????? ?????? one voice united we stand ?????? ?????? I am america ?????? 
>> there it is. 
>> It was a great ad. At the same time -- 
>> he had no desire whatsoever to be president. 
>> He had no path. Itas kind of like well, this is totally fascinating if you are not trying to be a serious prtial. 
>> He just wants to have fun. 
>> First of all, I'm very anti-staff staffer. I really think we have to - I'm not going to be on any tv ads for any candidate. It's only good advice for other staffers. 

[00:41:12]


>> Let's take it away. 
>> D.C. Is, of course, favorite political parlor game will be 2016. We have an open seat for the presidency, and it's open season for us to talk about it. Don't forget, check us out on our website, msnbc.Com and always follow us on facebook, like us, whatever you want to us. We'll be right back. rosa chantix. When the doctor told me that I could smoke for the first week... I'm like...Yeah, ok... Little did I know that one week later I wasn't smoking. 
[ Male Announcer ] ALONG WITH SUPPORT, Chantix is proven to help people quit smoking. It reduces the urge to smoke. Some people had changes in behavior, thinking or mood, hostility, agitation, depressed mood and suicidal thoughts or actions while taking or after stopping chantix. If you notice any of these stop taking chantix and call your doctor right away. Tell your doctor about any history of depression or other mental health problems, which could get worse while taking chantix. Don't take chantix if you've had a serious allergic or skin reaction to it. If you develop these stop taking chantix and see your doctor right away as some can be life-threatening. If you have a history of heart or blood vessel problems, tell your doctor if you have new or worse symptoms. Get medical help right away if you have symptoms of a heart attack. Use caution when driving or operating machinery. Common side effects include nausea, trouble sleeping and unusual dreams. It helps to have people around you... They say, you're much bigger than this. And you are. 
[ Male Announcer ] ASK YOUR DOCTOR IF CHANTIX Is right for you. 

[00:44:45]


>> When your insurance rates go down, then you'll both be at -- 
>> any time anyone makes a trip to iowa, people start speculate about what you are going to do in the future and all that. Let me just be blunt. I am not now, nor will I ever be a candidate for offensive coordinator of iowa. 
>> It's way too early to talk about 2016. I think I did mention that i have a warm regard for the people of iowa and new hampshire. 
>> Plenty of party favorites. They're already flirting with the 2016 run. Let's be honest. There's one potential dynasty do-over that dominates the early news in both parties. Let's bring back the gaggle. I look at this and say it's bush, it's clinton, it's for all the marbles. It's the rematch. If we don't get jeb and hillary, what are we going to do with ourselves? 
>> I love the primaries. 
>> I love great generals more. Come. Th would be -- 
>> this would be -- had would be like that time when you were like what if hillary clinton ran for the senate and what if rudy giuliani ran against? 
>> I think it's the only ticket that's ever had close to it would be kennedy-nixon where you had the two bug stars. Sfwoo two titanic figures of the party. You know, the thing I would say is I actually think it is n too far fetched to think that could happen. I think if hillary clinton does run, I find it hard to belie that andrew cuomos and martin o'malley's of the world say in. Jeb is the idealogical -- the guy who can mash the conservatives and the kind of establishment. He is the -- 
>> it's the purist versus the praying mattists. 
>> Well, jeb is the guy that could breach the divide. Let me ask you this, stephanie. It's not clear to me that clinton is the malheir to the obama coalition. Is it to you? Is she? 
>> I think that there is no natural heir. People wantou to earn it. I think that there is no argument out there that she hasn't earned it. She has. I think that she has done remarkably well as secretary of state. So many ooushg issues. This is the year of the woman. 

[00:46:57]


>> It is. It's going to happen. 
>> The two most popular figures we tested in our last msnbc-wall street journal poll. Both were named bsh bill and hillary, they're favorability rating higher than the president's. 
>> She runs her -- that said, she's an overwhelming favorite. The heir, though, I think is i don't think the heir is joe biden if hillary clinton doesn't run. I actually think elizabeth warren, throwing an unusual maim, if she were to run in 2016, she would have a great chance to maybe even defeat someone if it was not hillary clinton. 
>> He is a sitting vice president. 
>> He is vice president of the wraits. 
>> He is a weapon. 
>> It's a weird thing. 
>> And he is very good on the -- people -- he gets charactered. This guy that makes a lot of mistakes. If you watch him on the stump, he is very good at connecng. He has built into the obama organization, and that is how he has flourished. A lot of people within the media that really like him. To stephanie's point, you cannot sort of borrow or live off of what -- or be an heir to somebody else's organization. 
>> Bush did it with reagan in 1988. He didn't hold. Sfwl I'm talking about nowadays. Would you have to manage your own organization, and I don't see any of this heirs or passing of the torches anymore. 
>> I agr with that. There is no heir. I do think that joe biden is formidable. He really was our secret weapon out there. 
>> Eleven -- 
>> ohio, iowa, wisconsin. He lived in those states. 
>> I'm not betting on andy cuomo over joe biden, a sitting vice president. I know that the rest of this -- 
>> I would. I would definitely -- 

[00:48:59]


>> I'm just saying. 
>> That's the same argument we made for hillary clinton. Well, she's going to have the money. She's got the establishment and all good people around her. Andrew cuomo does not come into that race as formidable as hillary clinton looked in 2007. 
>> What about a republican? How do you prevent a republican primary picture that you guys had, which I think a lot of you folks and romney believe the -- 
>> look, I think the debates, actually, were -- became a bit of a side show there, and if you looked at the volatility of the torate at the time and how the -- and how the numbers went up and down based on debate performances and the side show that they became, I think that was something that had a very big effect. I think the rmc can step in and take more of a management role many the process there and have an impact on an eventual nominee and have that nominee much more viably 
>> so, you and I -- a fairly large field. Jeb would shrink it a little bit. Without jeb, boy, seven, eight serious people deep. 
>> Unlike like the '12 field, where you had kind of like rick santorum is the last guy standing against mitt romney? 
>> Herman cain? 
>> I should have went to vegas. Herman cain? You have real people, paul ryan, the vp nominee, bobby jindal, a governor of a state, marco rubio, a senator. John thune, another senator -- you have real people. 
>> And let me throw a name that nobody has talked about here. Of the four embattled republican governors of florida wisconsin, michigan and ohio, whoever survives will run for president. 
>> I think scott walker would love to run for president. 
>> Let me add one more point, it's hard to see a 2016 republican ticket that doesn't have a woman or minority on it in some capacity. That's very important. 
>> I thought for sure there would be a woman on the ticket in the democratic party and there hasn't been one yet. We asked who was the first president and the most recent president to officially start a term on a sunday which messes up inauguration plans in washington, the answers are james monroe and ronald reagan. The first time the inauguration date fell on a second was monroe's second in 1821, and the most recent in 1985. President obama's second inaugural will fall on a sunday which means he will take an oath and we'll do it all for the public the next day. If you have a political trivia question for us, e-mail it to us. We'll be right back with predictions and plugs from our gaggle. APOLOGIES TO MR. McLAUGHLIN. ] cool if we took the already great sentra apart and completely reimagined it with best-in-class combined mpg, not to mention more interior room than corolla and civic, and a technology suite with bluetooth, navigation, and other handy stuff? ?????? ?????? yeah. That would be cool. ?????? ?????? introducing the all-new nissan sentra. It's our most innovative sentra ever. Nissan. Innovation that excites. ?????? ?????? 

[00:54:43]


>>> let's bring back the gaggle for some final thoughts here. If I pose this question to you, kevin, a year from now in 2013, we will say 2013 was about what in washington? 
>> Well, I think a lot of it has do with the republican party will be trying to modernize their message. I think the two parties are now trying to energize their base and get things done in washington. Looking at two big issues. The tax reform, general disagreement there. 
>> How it goes. 
>> Where they agree on things like corporate rate, and also immigration reform. 
>> Stephanie, let me put it a slightly different way. How long does president obama's second term last? Second terms don't last four years sometimes domestically. 
>> They last four years, but there's a shelf life to what you can get done. 
>> Yeah. 
>> People will start looking at the midterms quickly. 
>> This is his year. 2013 is an important year to get things done. Tax reform, immigration reform. We have to finish implementing the health care law. A year from now people will be signing up for exchanges in states all over the country. 
>> Perry? 
>> We don't know if barack obama is a liberal a moderate. We've been debating that for two, four years. 
>> You think we'll know? 
>> I think we'll know. 
>> Is he a pragmatist? 
>> Is he a pragmatist? An iodeologuist. 
>> I'm going put you on the SPOT, McAULIFF THE BIG RACE IN 2013. Which will dominate the washington media market. terry McAuliffe? 
>> It's such a fascinating race, because it's kind of -- cucinelli is the national tea party hero in waiting, with alan west and michele bachmann. 
>> If he wins? 
>> If he wins, could see him in 2016. Just saying. 
>> Year of 2012, besides president obama's re-election, known as the year america got comfortable with gay marriage. That's it for this special edition of "the daily rundown." You can watch us at 9:00 a.M. On msnbc. Happy holidays, happy new year. Be safe from all of us at "the daily rundown."

=======================================================

Revolt against the senate bill to avoid the fiscal cliff. Good evening. I'm richard lui. You're watching the standoff in washington, d.C. The house gop is meeting at this hour for the second time today. Leadership and members are discussing how to move forward on a bill they say need to include spending cuts. House speaker john boehner and eric cantor arrived at the meeting together. But it was cantor who set off the storm earlier today just hours ago by announcing he could not support the senate bill that was approved this morning at 2:00 a.M. House democratic leader nancy pelosi attempted to put pressure on tonight. She posted this on twitter saying quote, strong majority of house democrats support the bipartisan senate bill that passed 89-8. Confident it will pass and speaker boehner allows an up or down vote. And republicans like congressman jack kingston of georgia blame the senate for a hastily written bill. 
>> It was way past those senators' bedtime. They were blurry eyed when they were reading it. We're trying to fill in the gap where they missed a few things. 
>> Let's bring in luke russert who has been covering this story on capitol hill. What's the latest on the meeting? We do understand earlier you were standing in front of speaker boehner's office and he was having a leadership meeting. 
>> They're having a leadership meeting where they're trying to fik yur out the way forward here. The plans they've said is they'd perhaps like to amend the senate-passed bill some time tonight. That's what we were getting. We do not know if that is still the plan because they're having this meeting where they're discussing what exactly they're going to do. We are told that heading into this meeting they were -- the members were explicitly told not to leak out any details. Usually you'll have some members that communicate during the actually meeting. They were very upset the leadership was about the leaks the last time around. So we probably won't know necessarily anything new until folks come out of that meeting. But from where we stand right now, the folks over in the united states senate has said this is a take it or leave it proposition. That if the house republicans do not accept this bill that is on -- it's over here that could be brought to the floor, then they will be single handedly responsible for taking the country over the fiscal cliff. That is not lost on a lot of members in the congress. I've spoken to many that would just like to vote on the senate bill. But others say it doesn't cut enough spending. They'd like to see more spending cuts. Perhaps we could attach an amendment, they say, to the proposal that would have more spending cuts. But what's interesting is john boehner for the last few weeks has said repeatedly let's let HARRY REID AND mitch McConnell and senate figure this out. Now they figured it out and now it's on the house side. As one republican member told me when the senate jams you, they jam you. And there's not a lot you can do about it. Don't ask for the senate to jam you then get angry afterwards. So the way forward, it's very perilous now. The markets in asia are going to open up in a few hours. I've got tons of e-mails from folks in the finance community wondering what exactly is happening in washington. We thought this was a done deal. It is very far from a done deal and maybe if we have no vote tonight on something, maybe it takes a market crash tomorrow or a lot of points off the dow in order for the house republicans to take the senate deal, richard. 

[00:03:30]


>> So anything can happen as you always remind us there. But based on what we understand right now, those two items come to pass that the amendment it and send it to the senate and the senate won't accept it, this could be dead. 
>> Then it's dead and we are in a holding pattern until the new congress convenes which will be some time on thursday. The 112th congress is up at 11:59 on thursday. Then there's a new congress. Logistically you start all over again. So it would take some time probably at least until friday to move on something and what is that something? We have no idea what could get passed in the house now. 
>> We are watching the ultimate theater there. Thank you. Luke russert. Earlier today luke also spoke with steven la turret about the resistance to the bill and where the republicans will go from here. 
>> You're a close ally of speaker boehner. What happened in conference today? What was to problematic with this bill for house republicans? 
>> It's heavy on tax increases. And it has nothing on spending reductions. And spending reductions are not only nonexistent, it adds billions of dollars of more spending. So that's not the balanced approach the president was talking about. 
>> Where do we go from here? You think there will possibly be a vote tonight on an amended bill? 
>> The overwhelming consensus in the conference was the leadership should go back and huddle and find an amendment that actually addressed spending in a responsible way. It's not going to be some amazingly huge package, but at least a token or symbol. With what the president himself has suggested. Just to lay down the markers to move forward that it's not just taxes. It's spending as well. 
>> What was looked at after the president already suggest snd. 
>> They were not specific. There was a lot of talk about sequester. And as you know in the senate proposal, sequester is only delayed for two months. Half of it's paid for by new taxes. At a minimum you'll see an amendment that says if we're not going to do sequester which was the down payment on the debt ceiling it should be with real spending cuts. 

[00:05:47]


>> We're getting indications from the senate they would not even look at an amended bill. mitch McConnell, joe biden they were here until the early hours of this morning on new year's day. What happens if that -- are we going off the fiscal cliff? 
>> Well, you know, I don't know. That'll be a decision for the senate. But quite frankly, the senate had in its power for over six months to do what they did at the stroke of midnight last night and that is amend a house bill and send it back to us. I think it's a little unreasonable for senator reid to say that something that they produced on new year's eve produced by a bunch of sleep deprived people is what we should adopt within 40 hours. 
>> Cantor obviously you said is against the bill as it stands. Boehner reserved judgment, did not say public opinion. Boehner can't go over cantor on this one. He needs cantor to back him up on any final deal, right? 
>> What they're attempting to craft is something to get to 218 votes which has been an elusive target in this 112th congress. But I sensed that if they came up with something that was responsible and reasonable and laid down the marker on spending that we'll be there with the spooeker. 
>> Going forward, do you think -- how many folks in your conference would support the bill as it is right now? 
>> That's hard to say. But it certainly wouldn't be the majority. The majority I don't know if you'd hit triple digits. I can only speak for myself that if the bill came up in its current form, I'd vote for it because I think it's unreasonable to hold hostage 95% of america and say you're getting a tax cut because we can't get our business taken care of. That doesn't mean I think it's a good bill. It would be a hold your nose and jump off the platform vote. 
>> So you think the number obviously boehner wants the majority. But for anything on this bill, 60, 70? Could you get that? 
>> I don't know. I'd put it on the 40, 50 range. Maybe. Maybe. 
>> Still a lot of room to go there then. 

[00:07:48]


>> If the democrats step up to the plate, the math becomes a different equation. I know the speaker wants to get something done. 
>> Are you ied that the house republican conference will receive the blame if the united states goes over the fiscal cliff because they want this bill amended? 
>> I watch your network a lot and republicans get the blame if it's sunny outside. I'm not really worried about that. You know, people will make their own judgments. But the people that I represent and I come from a swing district says this is a problem. People should pay their fair share. But we've got to do something about spending. 
>> Okay. That was ohio republican steven latourette speaking earlier today. First of all we heard from the senate floor, senate majority leader harry reid say he was talking about waiting games and tired staffers. He then adjourned the senate until tomorrow. Again, the question out there is if the house does amend that bill they received today and send it back to the senate, will the senate take it up or not? We're also hearing this according to our political director chuck todd. He says from a house gop leadership aide right now what the speaker is doing in this gop conference is proposing a two-bill strategy. I'll read exactly what the note says here. A two-bill strategy but only after they see if they have 218 votes for an amended version of the bill that came over at 2:00 a.M. This morning with the 89-8 support. The speaker presented his members two options. The first would be to make an amendment to the bill that would add a package of spending cuts. Then they would check to see if they had the 218 votes to get that passed. If not, then they will bring up the senate-passed measure for an up or down vote in the house. That is the latest we just heard in from chuck todd. I'd like to now bring in allison schwartz who is with us, democrat from pennsylvania. Thanks for being with us tonight. What's your thought and reaction to what I was just reading? This development we're hearing from one gop leadership aide. 

[00:09:58]


>> We've known all along and certainly speaker boehner knows that just having a piece of legislation that can pass the republican congress is not good enough. What we need is a bill and what we have before us is a bill i believe can pass the house. Which has bipartisan support and can get this done. Certainly there are issues that would match the republicans. The democrats know we have work to do going forward. Things we want to do. This bill doesn't take care of everything. But we're really passed midnight here. We are into new year's day. And this has been a long discussion. You know, speaker boehner took himself out of it and then said I promised as a matter of fact, pledged and committed as did eric cantor to bring up the bill that passes the senate. And it didn't just pass the senate. It was 89 votes. It's deeply bipartisan worked OUT BY mitch McConnell and the white house. Of course vice president biden was in there. 
>> Do you support the bill? 
>> This is not new information. Yes, I would support the bill. 
>> How many democrats would not support the bill? 
>> I don't have that count. I think it really -- I would hope and expect that this is a bipartisan bill. That's what the american people have been asking us to do is to find a way to prote the middle class in this country, to provide certainty for the markets and actually for all of us both consumers and investors and get it done. Don't go over this cliff. Take care of particularly the tax provisions in this legislation. We will have other opportunities to discuss and will be implementing either sequester an alternative. That's a trillion dollars in spending cuts we've committed to. The notion we haven't dealt with spending. We know we need some tax revenues. This is a compromise. 
>> We've got a minute left here, congress woman -- 
>> something we have to vote on. I'm saying. 
>> You want it to come to the floor on an up or down vote. 
>> Absolutely. 
>> In it doesn't come up to that, we're looking at the 113th. In the 20 seconds we have left now, would that be a better time? 

[00:12:05]


>> I think we get it done tonight. I think we have a piece of legislation I think does meet a lot of the requirements many of us have about tax fairness and bringing in some revenues and setting us at least partway on a path forward. Let's get it done. There are a lot of opportunities in the next congress to do more work. 
>> Thank you so much for your time. 42 hours until the 113th congress begins. We'll have the latest on these on-going negotiations all evening right here on msnbc. So make sure to stay with us as we watch the gop conference meeting, what comes out of that. We'll have that update for you next when we will be right back. more lose because for every 2 pounds you lose through diet and exercise, alli can help you lose one more by blocking some of the fat you eat.

>>> welcome back to the revvie awards. Making it up as he went b along, it went to paul ryan. 
>> You did run marathons at some point? 
>> Yeah. But I can't do it anymore because of my back. 
>> What's your personal best? 
>> Under three. High twos. 
>> Holy smokes. 
>> I did that when I was younger. 
>> This gets you out of that plateau. I keep my body fat between 6% and 8%. It's a good workout. 
>> You're just catching catfish by hand. It's exhilarating and quite fun. So we try to get down there during noodling season, end of may, early june to catch catfish. They're delicious. 
>> Congratulations, mr. Ryan for making it up on everything from marathon times to the auto bailout. You're me big winner. He's also accepting the beef cake of the year award. But that is given out in a special las vegas ceremony. Now back to the host of tonight's ceremony, the reverend al sharpt. 
>> Thank you. We're back with our revvie judges. Let's get right to our next round of awards. The best political force of the year is awarded to the person or group who drove the agenda in 2012. Victoria, who wins the award in your book? 
>> Here it goes to an unintended consequence. In the last segment we were talking about voter suppression. I think there was a silver lining here. Because across the country we saw people being kept from coming out to vote. And this mobilized them. We saw the lines in florida and texas. And in arizona. So for me the best political trend was the unintended consequence of mobilizing voters. 
>> All right. I think that's a good one. What do you think, richard? 
>> Well, I'm tempted to say the best political trend was the fading of the tea party. But that's got a couple more years to roll. So I'm going to say all those people who said young people wouldn't show up this election. They were not interested. They were gloomy. They showed up. The young people are engaged not just this cycle but last cycle. That means for cycles to come, this generation is going to take part in elections to come. I think that's the best thing you could have. 

[00:18:36]


>> He really does want to be out signing. He always gives us one option and goes to the other. 
>> Someone else is still looking for an answer maybe. 
>> But I always follow him with being crystal clear. Pun intended. 
>> Thank you. Well, I thought one of the best most heartening trends this year was that the big dollars as you referenced, karl rove, koch brothers, superpacs. They didn't win the day. It was ordinary people who kicked in a couple bucks who stood in the long lines who actually won the election. And that is just a beautiful, encouraging thing for this democracy. This big money losing. 
>> Jonathan. 
>> Ipg the best political trend of this political season was the demise of gay rights as a wedge issue. Notice in all three debates, it never came up. It was never even hinted at. Any talk pro or con about gay rights issues, same-sex marriage, equal protection, none of that. And I think that's a good thing. 
>> Okay. I think the best trend is that we saw this year a clear new electorate. We saw forever we have buried the idea that america is only male and only white. There's a permanent new political trend that the demographics of the electorate in this country has changed. And people need to get a new playbook. 
>> Now, next up is the worst political farce of the year. Is the revvie for the person or group who drove the agenda and their purpose into the ground. Jonathan, so who wins the award in your block? 

[00:20:38]


>> Mr.9-9-9, herman cain. People using a presidential campaign to sell books, to sell themselves, to make that the steppingstone to a larger career. No one did it better than herman cain or worse. 
>> I would say the worst trend this year is the republican party deciding they couldn't win the game with the rules as written. So trying to keep people from voting and essentially rig the rules. Which is a trend unfortunately that is ongoing. They've seen the writing on the wall. The new demographic realities and they're still trying to say how can we change the math and rig the rules so that we can still win? In virginia, for example, they proposed changing the way electoral votes would be awarded. Which would unfairly favor republicans. So they're still trying to rig the rules and hold back the tide of the demographics. 
>> And trying to rig the rules in the middle of the game. I've seen them change the rules but never mjd-game. At least wait until you lose the game. Richard? 
>> For me this is going to be john McCain and the conservative media for leading a preposterous and ultimately successful witch hunt against susan rice. Totally undeserved, totally personal. Frankly part of the conspiracy theories they've cooked up against any person of color serving around the president. Unjustified. It has a chilling effect on people in public service. And frankly it is sad for someone who had a stature and a GRAVITAS AS john McCain to pander to this. 
>> And now there's a trend. You see eric. 
>> This is a tough one. I had about half a dozen in this basket. I was going to say super pacs. But I think it's how republicans rolled back the clock on women. You know, if we remember in 2010 women did very well in the republican party. It was the year of the momma grizzlies. This year they erased all that. They went after women and most recently they didn't name any chairs. Then they back tracked and decided to name one woman to the administrative committee which is essentially the clerical committee. 

[00:22:58]


>> The housewife. 
>> Very madmen. 
>> But it was interesting that they went after women and didn't debate gays. It was a contorted strategy. We're goingo attack women openly and not deal with gays or even marriage equality in many cases as an issue. 
>> They put their target on women. 
>> Right. And think about it. They figured that the -- the public opinion is moving away from opposition to gay rights. But they thought it was perfectly fine to go after women's rights. Amazing. 
>> Now, what I thought was very interesting in probably the worst political trend is in '88 there was a guy named brown that designed the dew caucus adds. This is the same guy. From willy horton that unleashed all this money. I think the aim was to take the lid off of money which was a right wing strategy that really backfired. It drove them into the ground. In the sense that I think that they thought they had bought an election. It's almost like getting a credit card somewhere and pick up to find the merchandise isn't there. It was the worst trend. It did happen because had they nov believed in that trend, they might have done more work. They might have built more organization on the ground. And they might have moved to a more sensible political policy. 
>> Money can't buy you love, reverend. 
>> Yeah. And they put all their faith in money and the power of money. 
>> Well, I agree with you. Money can't buy you love. And when it does, they're going to always say what have you done for me lately? You got to keep buying it. 
>> Not the good kind of love. 
>> I mean, we could do these songs all night. It's been an amazing year, and there are more revvies to come. Stay with us. 

[00:25:05]


>>> The revvies return with newt gingrich, rick santorum, and the best new political newcomer of the year. But first the revvie for outstanding performance in a dance. And the nominees are. ???????????? 
>> the lasso again. And then the horse. The cowboys riding. 
>> Ride on, senator allen simpson. Ride on. You're our winner. And the 2012 revvies will be right back. snapshot progressive, but don't just listen to me. Listen to these happy progressive customers. I plugged in snapshot, and 30 days later, I was saving big on car insurance. With snapshot, I knew what I could save before I switched to progressive. The better I drive, the more I save.

[00:29:04]


>>> Welcome back to the second annual revvie awards from rockefeller center in new york city. Here's the host of "politicsnation," the reverend al sharpton. 
>> Welcome back. Here at "politicsnation" we love a good science fiction sto. And this year the gop gave us plenty of fantasy. Our next award is the ray bradbury award for lead performance in a science fiction role. It's one of my favorites. Watch this. 
>> By the end of my second term, we will have the first permanent base on the moon. And it will be american. 
>> It seems to me first of all from what I understand from doctors, that's really rare. If it's a legitimate rape, the female body has ways to try to shut that whole thing down. 
>> I said the science I bogus. The dangers of carbon dioxide. Tell that to a plant how dangerous carbon dioxide is. 
>> All the candidates are so deserving. But the revvie can only go to one person. And it goes to newt gingrich for his out of this world ideas. Congratulations, newt. Your revvie will be waiting for you at the moon base when you get there. We'll be right back. 
>>> Revvies will return with president obama, clint eastwood, and karl rove. Plus the award for political performer of the year. You're watching the second annual revvie awards only on msnbc. 

[00:33:47]


>>> Welcome back to the revvies. Here, again, is the host of "politicsnation," the reverend al sharpton. 
>> Thank you. I'd like to welcome back our esteemed panel of judges. JONATHAN CAPEHART, VICTORIA de Fran ches koe soto and richard wolffe. Great to have all of you with us. 
>> Great to be here. 
>> It's the season of giving. Let's get back to giving out those revvies. The rising star of the year award is the revvie for the biggest political powerhouse of 2012. Krystal, who wins that award in your book? And I'm looking forward here. I'm looking in the crystal ball. I'm looking for who going forward stood out this year but gives us where we're going in the future. Because the next presidential election, there'll be no incumbent. 
>> Right. 
>> We are going to see both parties have an open shot at it. So who gets that revvie? Who's the person we ought to be watching? 
>> Well, she already had a pretty large star, but I think hillary clinton has just continued to grow in stature. The front runner. Hands down not only for the democratic nomination, but even republicans are admitting that they're pretty scared of her in 2016. And partly it's because republicans use this device of saying the clintons were the good and reasonable democrats that we could work with. They actually elevated the clintons themselves. Now hillary's stepping down as secretary of state. She'll be doing lots of non-political work over the next few years and I think her star will only continue to burn brighter and brighter. Of course everyone will be paying very close attention to see what indications she gives as to whether she's going to go or not go for 2016. 
>> What do you think, jonathan? 
>> I think benghazi will be a black spot on her years as secretary of state. But I would give my rising star award to what I'm calling the obama coalition. African-americans, latinos, gays and lesbians, young people, women. All the folks we've been talking about all year and even tonight who came together and decided that they wanted to give him four more years. Despite where the economy is, despite the right track, wrong track. They decided to tell the republicans all your talk about us being demoralized, that we're not for this guy anymore, that's bunk. We're with him. 

[00:36:25]


>> But who out of that coalition? Is there a person or -- 
>> let me -- I yield, yes. 
>> To the lady to your left. 
>> And we didn't coordinate. But for me it doesn't go to one particular person. It goes to latinos. It goes to the latino electorate that flexed its muscle. And we see going forward of being decisive. Not just because of the growth of the population but because of where they are. Latinos are strategically placed in red states. And latinos are pushing these red states into light red, into purple. And eventually it's going to take a bit. Texas isn't going to turn blue in four years or eight years, but it's going to turn these traditionally red southern states into toss-up states. So the latino muscle is moving the landscape of this country. 
>> Is julio castro one to watch? 
>> He would not make it statewide in texas. He doesn't have a jumpoff point. And he's term limited as mayor. But he's going to have to bide his time and come back. I give him ten years. 
>> Although you have to say if you did have a democrat from texas who could win texas statewide, what an incredible force they would be on the national level. If you could in the future -- 
>> it's going to be george p. If we're going to see a latino in texas in the next six to eight years, it's going to be george. 
>> Richard, you've been quiet. 
>> As someone who's been on the revvie awards since their inception last year, I feel like as much respect I have for my fellow judges, it's a copout. I respect your arguments. These are big things, big trends. But this is the rising star award. It's to one person. 
>> And you're a veteran so go ahead. 

[00:38:26]


>> Elizabeth warren. We have unfinished business on wall street. In the housing market. Elizabeth warren is going to be the rising star to finish that business or at least keep it in the public eye at a time when the economy's going to pick up and wall street would be forgetting about all it. We need to have an accounting. 
>> So no one sees a rising repuican star? 
>> You know, I thought about mentioning I do think marco rubio and chris christie are going to be very prevalent voices in the conversation about what the republican party is going to do next. So -- and I think christie to your point earlier richard, did himself a lot of favors at the end of the campaign by showing that bipartisan side because that is where the republican party needs to go if they're going to be relevant in the next four years. So I would say those two are going to be important in the future. 
>> So on the republican side you say christie, rubio. 
>> I'm going with christie on this one. I think marco's very talented, but I think he's going to have a lot of obstacles going forward. And there are other rising latino stars within the republican party that can block him out such as ted cruz, sandoval. He's going to have to watch his back. 
>> I don't know whether this person should be considered a rising star yet, but I think he's interesting for what he could possibly do. And that's senator-elect I guess is what you call him tim scott 
>> no senator select. 
>> Appointed by hailey. jim DeMint is leaving. But tim scott, the first african-american senator from the deep south, the first from south carolina. He has to run for real in 2014. But unlike other black republicans, herman cain, allen keys, allen west, the defeated congressman from florida. Tim scott is someone who's considered to be serious. And so it'll be interesting to watch how this. 

[00:40:35]


>> Reporter: 
>> That he meets with me and is going to come out as a progressive. 
>> Good luck with that. 
>>> Another big moment this year is when clint eastwood changed the way we view chairs. Forever. 
>> What do you want me to tell romney? I can't tell him to do that. Can't do that to himself. You're crazy. You're absolutely crazy. 
>> So in his honor, we will be awarding the clint east woodward empty chair award for the best performance for not showing up. 
>> About 81 members of the democratic party -- 
>> this is just about saying it's something else. 
>> You are not allowed to be a president if you're not born in this country. He may not have been born in this country. 
>> And the revvie goes to none other than donald trump who was out of it the entire year. Congratulations, mr. Trump. 
>>> We'll have more revvies right after this. 
>>> The revvies will return with a blueberry pie lifetime achievement award. But first a special revvie. The lost their shirt award for worst investor of the year. Given to those who made the worst investments of this year's presidential election. The competition is stiff. The koch brothers spent nearly $34 million. Sheldon adelson spent nearly $40 million. But karl rove's group tops the list with a whopping $91 million. Congratulations, mr. Rove. You've spent lots of money with nothing to show for it. This is mr. Rove's first revvie but he's nominated in another category, so don't go anywhere, karl. This could be a sweep. You could be this year's anic."

[00:50:41]


>>> Welcome back to the revvies. Here once again is the host of "politicsnation," the reverend al sharpton. 
>> Thank you and welcome back for our final revvie awards of the evening. Still with me our fantastic panel of judges. Jonathan capehart, victoria defrancesco-soto, krystal ball, and veteran of the revvies richard wolffe. And now for the big one. The biggest winner of 2012. Richard? 
>> Okay. The obvious one is obviously the president. But I'm not going to do the obvious one. I'm going to say michelle obama. Not only because her husband won, because she doesn't have to campaign again which she hates. Because she sailed through the election with sky high ratings. And because now she can actually do some of the bigger stuff about obesity, the biggest public health challenge in this country, frankly the western world. She can now do what she wants. 
>> I'm going with claire McCASKILL. Not just because she won her race -- thank you todd akin -- but because she showed the face of what. I THINK claire McCaskill really came out winning. 
>> Jonathan? 
>> I would say that the 47% were the winners of this election. Because they told mitt romney and the republican party to stuff it. They got off their lazy, unprincipled, immoral behinds and got out there and voted for president obama. 
>> Krystal? 
>> I got to go with the obvious one, president obama. Not just because he won and won convincingly, his policies have been vindicated, health care has been upheld, his approval rating is rising. He's likely to now oversee a recovery. I mean, he really truly was the big winner this year. 
>> I would go with jonathan with the 47% or even more. The 99%. Because I think that they showed political muscle and political tenacity that had been underestimated. I mean, a lot of people had said young people people, blacks, latinos, gays would not come out. And I think they sent a message that all of the experts including some of the democratic experts are going back to the drawing board trying to recon fig rate what happened. 

[00:53:10]


>> They were counting on them not to show up. That's part of the republican winning strategy was that blacks and latinos in particular would not show up. 
>> And they will never make that mistake again thinking those groups will stay home and not raise their voices. 
>> Now, we mentioned other people throughout the night on this award. Everyone has been, you know, the president and others. What about bill clinton? Nobody's brought his name up this year. Or this revvie award. 
>> Well, bill clinton's been a winner for awhile. But I think what he did for the president particularly in that dnc speech which was just unbelievable. Laying out the case saying here are some of the attacks on this president. Here's why they're completely unfounded in doing it in simple language. It really was incredible both for his own legacy and image and also for hillary and family. 
>> Certainly. That's the key. 
>> Certainly for the president. 
>> When you look at '08, he was not a winner. He came off very badly and lost a lot of support on the base. Had guys like me taking real shots at him. And this year, he really came on strong. I think he has to be considered a winner this year. 
>> And think about all of charlotte. By the time president clinton gave his fantastic speech, those folks were fired up and ready to go. They wanted to hear that. They needed to hear that message. 
>> You know, they made them hungry for more clinton. Made it clinton 2016. 
>> I can watch that speech every day, personally. 
>> Let's turn to the revvie that was the biggest loser of 2012. 
>> Well, my loser is sort of the yin to your yang. Todd akin. He's a laughing stock. And he's out of touch with the women, the huge margins they lost women by. And he's just a joke for his absurd and offensive kmints about rape. 

[00:55:19]


>> Todd akin. Jonathan? 
>> I'm going the obvious route. I'm going to say it's mitt romney. This is a man who any republican by historical standards should have won the election against a president with unemployment above 7% with the wrong track in the 60%. With the economy still in the doldrums coming back but not coming back enough. President obama, if you want to be honest with yourself, was not supposed to win. Mitt romney was supposed to win, and he didn't. By running the worst presidential campaign at least i have ever seen in my young lifetime. 
>> But how do you call a man with car elevators in his house a loser? He's doing very well. Victoria? 
>> My loser award goes out to my fellow texans in terms of rick perry. Rick perry flopped in the primary. Then he goes back to texas and puts all his chips behind david dewhurst in the senate race. When ted cruz comes out and mops the floor. So rick perry is a double loser nationally and at the state level. 
>> Richard? 
>> So I'm going to break my copout rule here and go with a whole group. IT'S ALL OF THOSE CEOs INCLUDING Mitt romney who thought the president was incompetent and destined to lose. You know, these guys may be wealthy and powerful, but they're a bunch of losers right now. 
>> Really? Why? 
>> Because they got it wrong. How badly did they misjudge this president? How badly did they misunderstand the country which has given them so much wealth? THOSE CEOs BACKED THE WRONG SIDE And now have to face up to reality. But their customers, the people they work with are not the country they thought it was. You could be a ceo and you can be so out of touch. These people need to look in the mirror and say we got this badly, badly wrong. 
>> I think the big loser of the year is the right wing media. I think that their whole facade was destroyed this year. They lost the ability to convince people that if they keep putting something on high rotation, it's going to stick. The birther thing they couldn't make stick. And any number of other things didn't stick. Rush limbaugh started losing stations. Wre started seeing a lot of things go down around the right wing media. They lost their punch. I think we look behind the veil and the wizard wasn't there. 

[00:57:49]


>> And the knockout blow there was election night when they were so wrong about what was going to happen. 
>> All the way to where they started challenging their posts. It's time for the moment you've all been waiting for. Predictions for the new year. 2013, what's going to happen? Jonathan, start us off with your prediction. 
>> I think the supreme court is going to give a ruling on same-sex marriage that will make it legal wherever it's happening now, it's legal. It'll be a two-step thing. It'll be a bit of a punt, but it wip a situation where we could get it for the entire country in another case. 
>> Victoria? 
>> Three words. Comprehensive immigration reform. 
>> Richard? 
>> Tax reform. Immigration reform. Gun safety reform. Three things, three big things by the summer of next year. 
>> Look into your crystal ball. 
>> I think scott brown will run for senate again to fill john kerry's open seat and he will lose again. 
>> I think we're going to see the supreme court come with some good stuff and some bad stuff. I think we're going to see states try to undermine a lot of national moves. I think that you should keep your boots and picket signs right next to your champagne glasses. Because by next year's revvies, we're going to have to have used a lot of both. Well, that's it for 2012 revvies. I'd like to thank our panel. Jonathan capehart, victoria defrancesco-soto, krystal ball, and richard wolffe. We know 2013 will give us more chances to hand out the revvies. Thank you for watching. Good night to everybody. 
>>> You've been watching the 2012 revvie awards. Brought to you by "politicsnation" and al sharpton. Thanks for watching. We hope you have a safe and happy holiday season. And see you next year! Good night, everybody!

O the fiscal cliff deal. 12 hours ago, 14 hours ago rather, 2:00 a.M., The senate passed a bill, 89-8 in the bipartisan fashion. Then was sent over to the house. It was hopeful that the house would then take that bill and agree to it, that it would pass with 218 votes, and then perhaps it would become law and the fiscal cliff deal would be done. However, we've just learned within the last 30 minutes that the second ranking republican in the house does not support the bill as it stands. And as our luke russert has been reporting to us, this would mean a whole other round of amendments perhaps to that bill. It also could mean that, therefore, it would go to the senate and then back to the house. This as we look at only 44 hours left in the 112th congress, and can they get done or will it have to start all over again on thursday with the 113th congress? Nbc's luke russert has been reporting for us and he was speaking with members early and heard from one member, luke, and I found this very interesting, you said that that member told you that was in the room for one of the meetings in the conference, 40 members spoke up, 37 spoke out against the plan, and 3 spoke for it. Who are those three? Who might they be? And what is the sentiment they have that they're brave as it sounds to be one of the few? 
>> Reporter: Well, with he don't know who those three were exactly, but you saw on our air a little while ago mr. Latourette saying he would support the plan because he did not think it was right to hold the middle class hostage in these types of negotiations. But, richard, right over my left shoulder behind me about 20 yards is john boehner's office. We're told there's a leadership meeting going on right now amongst the top players in the house gop. They're trying now to possibly sculpt an amend. They could add to this bipartisan senate bill that passed with 89 votes early this morning to try to bring it on the house floor as early as tonight to change it to something they feel would be more easily digested by their rank and file. We do not know what that amendment will look like. From members I have spoken to, they said they hoped it would be sensible. What is sensible for house republicans is not necessarily sensible for senate democrats or not necessarily sensible for the white house. So we are now going in to the evening hours on january 1st where the markets are closed today, it's a holiday, with no real idea what's going to happen with that compromise crafted by the senate, what the house is going to do. We very well could wake up tomorrow with all street and the markets ramped up and ready to go with no idea what the path forward is. And from folks I have talked to inside that gop leadership meeting who were close to the speaker who were expected to vote on this today, they said they were really surprised by their colleagues, that they were saying things that were totally illogical. This idea that john boehner could perhaps rehash his negotiations with president obama. Members who were there told me that some of their colleagues do not realize how late in the game the country really is when it pertains to the fiscal cliff. So there's a lot of moving parts. We've been saying that. Things are fluid. It's become cliche up here, but it really is the truth in that at this point after that bill passed out of the senate with 89 votes, most of us thought there might be a small hiccup, but probably decently smooth sailing. We're approaching very treacherous waters right now. 

[00:03:31]


>> It's rocky waters certainly. 
>> Yeah. 
>> Luke, you know, in your notes you said that the member told you, the member that gave you that number, that he felt like he was living in another world. That was the quote here. What was the frustration that was -- that you were sensing? The sheer incredulity was certainly there. 
>> Reporter: I think the idea a lot of the rank and file and they've been called chuckle heads before, this group that does not want to give an inch on anything, doesn't realize the severity of the situation. I think that's where there's a lot of frustration from folks who have been around here for a while that understand that governing is give and take. There's obviously, this is not a perfect deal for house republicans. There's a lot of things they don't like in it, but a lot of them have told me, the folks who support this bill, is, look, we are getting $400,000 for the threshold. That's up from $250,000, we'll take that and we can fight the president on the debt limit. We can fight him on the government funding bill. There's a lot of fights to be had and there's a lot more we can get. Frankly, they think they're better goshg yaters. They don't get where there's this holdup. The folks on the other side say this is a bad bill. There's not enough spending cuts. It's not what we like to see. It's a concussion to the president because it extends unemployment, it extends the middle class tax cuts part of the stimulus. Those folks want their voices heard. The way john boehner leads is he says the house is the will of the american people. With cantor coming out against this, you heard from mr. Latourette, it would be very hard for john boehner to move ahead of eric cantor and try to put this bill on the floor without it being amended. 
>> Luke, stand by. Mike viqueira is also with us this hour to bring us up to date. One of the points brought up by luke russert when he was speaking with representative latourette was the number that could support the bill as it stands right now, that number that representative latourette was just putting out there was 40 to 50. As we know, that magic number is 218. 
>> Reporter: Yeah. Here is another number, 89. 89 people in the united states senate voted for this thing and one more number for you, richard, 5. 5 people voting against it. Of the eight who voted against it in total were republicans. The thought was that such a strong vote with carry the day in the house of representatives. They would see the political and economic writing on the wall. Evidently that's not going to happen or at least it's shaping up that way and the scenario that luke and I have been describing over the course of the last half hour is now taking shape where the house may be trying to vote tonight or tomorrow to amend this thing and then thereby throwing the entire question of a deal of going off the fiscal cliff into flux because, as we have been discussing, a brand new congress is sworn in on thursday. The senate has said they're not likely to take up anything the house does to begin with and if the new congress is sworn in, the legislative slate is wiped clean and we start over. And there is mayhem and chaos surrounding markets and anger, if there can be any more anger and frustration toward washington because people's paychecks will be checked at a higher rate. Let's review what's happened in the last ten days. John boehner and eric cantor put their plan "b" on a friday on the floor 69 house of representatives. It set the income threshold at $1 million over which you would be taxed at a higher rate. They wanted to do that because you simply can't beat someth with nothing. They wanted to have something to send over to the senate to negotiate with in addition to what they had sent over last summer which was pretty much a nonstarter that they had recognized. That crashed and burned and went down in flames at which point john boehner said, look, it's up to the senate. They can negotiate -- harry reid can negotiate with president obama however they want to work it. They essentially punted and said it's up to you. That didn't go very well. mitch McConnell the republican leader and harry reid at one point stopped negotiating at about 7:00 on saturday night. On sunday morning mitch McCONNELL CALLS JOE BIDEN. They get together, offers are traded back and forth, and presto, voila, they come up with a deal and they put it on the floor and it sets those thresholds at $400,000 and $450,000 and it's passed at 2:00 last night and so it comes to the house republicans who have met all morning. Joe biden incidentally was back on the hill this morning meeting behind closed doors with democrats who are pretty much bystanders to a republican political train wreck at this point. Nancy pelosi says the bill representing gigantic progress, that's fine, but this is really on republicans right now. And people are looking at it, I'm already hearing people looking at what house republicans are doing and saying, look, you abdicated your responsibility to write a bill. You punted over to the senate, and now you're going to throw a monkey wrench into this whole thing and make us come back perhaps in a new congress with a clean legislative slate. So it is a very dangerous not only economic situation here that we're being presented with this new year's day but certainly a very dicey political situation for house republicans. You mentioned, you know, the vote count. Always a nebulous question when you're talking about the house of representatives. There are 241 republicans, i believe, in the house right now in this current congress that's still in session for another day and a half and 190 democrats. You know, we can divide the numbers anyway you want. Let's say they get 150 democrats or maybe less because there are plenty of people on the left who think the president caved on those tax rates after campaigning at the level of $250,000, the president caved. He didn't need to cave. He should have played hardball. They're going to be disaffected. They're going to take a walk on leadership. Okay. Let's call it 140 democrats. 218 is the majority. Do the math, carry the one. What am I up to? 78, 80 republicans they would need. It's still unlikely I think that john boehner would put something on the floor that would need that many democrats and that few republicans that would support it. 

[00:09:23]


>> Still too far away when it comes to numbers. Thanks for doing that. Luke, I want to get to you before we go to break in the next minute or so. If we do see an amendment made to the bill that came over from the senate 14 hours ago, is the senate there? They are in session, but will the members be -- can they be brought back in time to make this line in the sand as we know the new 113th congress being sworn in? 
>> Reporter: In theory yes. The senate was in session today. I'm told a lot of tenators are very much still in washington, d.C. They just voted on this bill in the wee hours of this morning. It's hard to believe it's the same day, it's still the same day. Assume the house amends it, does harry reid even take it up? It depends what the amendment looks like. If it's going to be a significant spending cut, you have to understand, these negotiations are like jinga. Piece upon piece upon piece. If you take something out, the whole thing can fall apart, and honestly, a spending cut amendment, especially one that would be accepted by all house republicans or a lot of the house republicans probably would hurt and blow away the carefully constructed compromise that was crafted and voted on early this morning. It's possible they could do it tomorrow because there's one day left. This congressional session expired 11:59 thursday. 
>> Thank you so much. We hope they're not playing jangg on capitol hill but you did make it understandable for us. Right now the country remains without a deal. We'll go to break and we'll join programming already in process. Aig? going aig? sa

Woman: We're helping joplin, missouri, come back from a devastating tornado. 
Man: And now we're helping the east coast recover from hurricane sandy. We're a leading global insurance company, based right here in america. We've repaid every dollar america lent us. Everything,plus a profit of more than $22 billion. For the american people. Thank you, america. Helping people recover and rebuild -- that's what we do. Now let's bring on tomorrow. 
>>> It was aold and gray and wet and rainy afternoon in chicago a few saturdays back. Kind of day that not many people want to be outside in unless they absolutely have to. And so only a few people by which I mean a few thousand people, bundled up in their rain gear and headed out to grant park in chicago to cheer on veterans of the iraq war and the afghanistan war. As the second city staged its welcome home parade to mark the end of the iraq war and to thank the troops who served there to say welcome home to the shoulders. Go, chicago. And there were marching b and motorcycles and war dogs and more than 1,000 veterans turning out to hear spectators on the side of the road shouting thank you, both literally and figuratively from the sidewalks of columbus drive. With the december 15th parade, chicago became the biggest city in the united states to hold an event like this one. And maybe in the year 2013 a parade like this will finally take place in new york city where we traditionally do this as a country. But in 2012 all year long regular joe and regular jane citizens from across the country in cities big and small took the initiative, decided to do it on their own, and they staged their own welcome home parades to mark the end of the iraq war. And every time they did it, it was the best new thing in the world. Our nation's first ever, look at that, first ever parade for troops coming home from the war in iraq. It hoped saturday in st. Louis, missouri. Tens of thousands of people lined the streets cheering the troops and shaking hands. This was a thank you big enough to make the nation notice and also personal enough to grab your heart and rattle it a little. 

[00:16:00]


>> Twice army national guard major rick ranford has flown home after serving in iraq. 
>> You could have dropped me in any city in the united states because I was home. 
>> Reporter: He was touched by the outpouring of his hometown. 
>> Completely overwhelmed. 
>> This from "nightly news" this weekend. Our nation has been debating whether now is a good time to celebrate veterans coming home from iraq, especially since so many of them are being redeployed to afghanistan which iu a war, of course, that is ongoing. Still though, on sunday the new york giants will be playing the new england patriots in a football game known as the super bowl. By tradition the winning team gets a big parade downtown. New york giants got one in 2008. The patriots got one in 2005 when they were champs. There's nothing wrong with celebrating football. I myself am a celebrant. I wonder if it won't be a little weird for our country to go crazy over a sports team while still saying not yet to the veterans. My friend paul rieckhoff asked that flat out online challenging the mayors of new york and boston. Are you really okay with your football team getting a ticker-tape parade and not your iraq vets? For now today st. Louis, missouri, pulling off its welcome home the heroes parade. For st. Louis, well done. I have a question specifically for any military veterans watching right now. You by any chance want to rock and roll all night and party every day? You may get your chance because kiss is hiring a rhode. They are touring this summer and they're looking for a set carpenter to assemble their stage, operate special effects, and help take it down. It's a hard job. They say you don't need to be a trained carpenter but you need to be prepared to work hard, long hours. Kiss has another request. They say they want to hire a vet to do this job. That is a sweet job for someone occupying that sweet spot. Great as that is, that is not the best new thing in the world. This is the best new thing in the world. Tomorrow tucson, arizona, is going to be looking something like this. Maybe with different architecture in the background, probably with fewer people wearing warm gloves and hats. That's because these are pictures of the first ever parade in the united states to mark the end of the iraq r. To say welcome home and thank you to iraq war veterans. The iraq war ended in december. This first parade was held in st. Louis in january which is why everybody looks cold. 100,000 people showed up in st. Louis. It was a huge success. A home run. Tomorrow, this is a big deal, tomorrow the second big parade in the united states of america to mark the end of the war. And this time it will be held in tucson, arizona. As was the case in st. Louis, this isn't the military or the government coming up with this idea. This is just citizens, just regular folks, regular americans, civians, who wanted to say thank you and welcome home. The organizers of tomorrow's tucson parade say they were inspired by what st. Louis did. We have had three debates so far. Presidential and vice presidential. The candidates collectively have spent the better part of five hours arguing about medicare and social security and china, and immigration and jobs. They have argued over the rules, over freaking big bird but there's been no talk at all about how we are treating veterans. Outsidthe beltway in a totally nonport san way across the country lots and lots and lots of americans have been thinking about what happens to this new generation of veterans when they come home. Sometimes with injuries and trauma and almost always in need of a new job. Ordinary americans are holding their own parades, welcome home troops, love st. Louis. Welcome home troops, love houston. Welcome home, love richmond, virginia. Also welcome home, love little melbourne, florida, and tucson and new england coastal sport portsmouth, new hampshire. The pentagon for reasons I do not start to understand still says they do not want new york city to hold a parade to mark the end of the iraq war and welcome home the troops. And new york city is where we have always done this sort of thing as a nation. I mean, new york did throw one ticker-tape parade this year for the super bowl champion new york giants, and at their parade, we met the willis family. Mom, glenda with her grandson josiah. They brought with them a picture of glenda's son and not incidentally a huge giants fan. Sergeant willis had sent a message from afghanistan before the big game. 

[00:20:43]


>> I'm staff sergeant willis. I'm originally from brooklyn new york and I want to say hi to my family in brooklyn and go big blue. 
>> His mom told us she promised him she would go to the parade if the giants won and she would bring his picture. Well, the giants won and work held the parade and glenda kept her promise. She told us it would be compassionate to have a par rad for her son and daughter in new york. There's still no parade in the works for new york city to welcome home the troops, but i can tell you that sergeant willis is home. And he and his family are here tonight with us watching the show in this very room. So welcome home, sergeant willis. Look, you're on tv. It is really cool to have you guys here and it's the best new thing in our world today. Best new thing in the world today, st. Louis, missouri, pulling off its welcome home the heroes parade. They did it first in the country and it's the best new thing in the world today and there will be more to come, mark my words. Best new thing in the world today. 
>> Best new thing in the world. They actually keep getting better from here. Stay with us. The poop fairy one is coming up. The world today and there will -??]??9???????? L@??o N????wyg??!nB w w wt<@m=m=m=o?>??kFokDr

His newest persona is hockey star.

>>> The best new thing in the world today is a growth opportunity for republican political strategists. A lucrative source of revenue just waiting to be tapped. Now, i, jane lynch, am not normally one to give career advice to republicans, but guys and gals, there's money to be made on promoting gay rights within the republican party. You see, the de facto head of the republican party, one willard mitt romney, has taken a strong position on the side of the gay rights debate, that if you're a politician is getting to be the side you don't much want to be on. But the rest of his party may be about to evolve around him. This weekend a respected republican pollster, one who helped president george w. Bush win re-election, wrote a memo basically saying, guys, I've got a lot of polling here, and the gay marriage thing is setting kind of popular. And he suggested that republicans might want to change the way they talk about stuff like gay marriage. Maybe start saying that support for gay marriage is consistent with, quote, conservative fundamentals. As people who promote personal responsibility, family values, commitment, and stability and emphasize freedom and limited government, we have to recognize that freedom means freedom for everyone. This includes the freedom to decide how you live and to enter into relationships of your choosing. The freedom to live without excessive interference of the regulatory force of the government. Folks, that's a republican telling republicans folks, that's a republican telling rep to reframe gay rights. He may be one of the first to do it, but he won't be the last. But jane lynch, you ask, where is the job opportunity in all this? After all, we republicans are all about jobs, jobs, jobs. Well, here it is. Someone is going to have to teach republicans how to talk about gay rights without seeming like they've caved to the democrats. Some strategists are going to have to make it their specialty. To teach republicans how to be pro-gay while still sounding angry. That's a very tall order, but the good news is, you can charge more money. Republicans are trying to figure out how to lose gracefully. Oh, best new thing in the world today. 

[00:30:45]


>> Jane lynch, you're the best new thing in the world today. 
>> Thank you so much. 
>> When you said, folks -- do i do that? 
>> You do. I was mocking you. 
>> I felt new a very painful way. 
>> Thanks for doing the best new thing in the world. It's weird I'm in the guest chair. 
>> How does it feel? 
>> Subservient but in a good way. 
>> I'm up a little higher and this is the better side of my face. 
>> Do you want to be a cable news host ever? 
>> I'd love to play one. I don't know that I'd want to do it day in and day out. I know how much you guys work and how you have to have your finger on the pulse and all that but I'm a political junkie but I'd love to play one. 
>> When he asked you if you wanted to do a bnew thing in the world, you had a republican pollster memo in mind for something you wanted to do. 
>> Yeah. 
>> I mean, the thing about the subject of what you just talked about that I think is interesting is that this is something -- I mean, you are out, you are sue sylvester on "glee" you have written this back "happy accidents" in which you talk about your coming out story and your family and all these personal things and we are in a moment when the politics of gay rights are rapidly, rapidly changing in the country. 
>> I know. Fast, really fast. You know, it is an issue that i have not really taken personally so much. It's something I watch on television is great interest, i have a stake in it, I have skin in the game as it were, but when the president came out and said he supported the dignity. Our families and our relationships, that really moved me. That really touched me for the first time and I realized I had been kind of distanced emotionally from it, but that really kind of broke it open for me. It made me very, very hap 
>> that was one of those things that covering it as a gay person, think being it as a gay person and covering it as a person in the news, I felt like half of me had to have a talk with the other half because like -- 
>> understood. 
>> In the pundit world, the way that was responded to and the way people are still talking about it in pundit world, in politics world is, well, how many people are there who agree with the president? It's going to help him with them and how many people di agrees with him, it's going to hurt him with them. And the gay part of me, sort of human part of me, wants to explain, you know what? The big issu, the big question is who already agrees with him or disagrees with him, but who is still changing their mind? Who is persuadable? And is he going to persuade anybody? Does this change history? 

[00:33:03]


>> I don't know if it changes history. I don't know if it was just political calculus on his part, but I think he really does believe in the dignity of our relationships and our right to exist, but I think there are people we're not going to get, and that's fine and probably not in this lifetime and that's fine, but I think there are changeable folks. Of people change when they're in the prce of one of us. They get to know us and they get to know our family, and I think that's, you know, being -- that's why I think being out for me anyway is important, and, you know, allowing myself to appear in public with my family and not hiding about it and I think that's really important. 
>> You know, one -- I have a sound bite that I wanted to play for you that was from before president obama came out and said what he did. A few days before that, vice president biden, god bless him, went on "meet the press" I think to everybody's surprise started talking about how he was all in favor -- 
>> I love him. 
>> Same-sex marriage rights. But he mentioned -- he hit a pop culture tv hstone while he was explaining it. Can we play that sound bite? 
>> This is e voluming. By the way, my measure david, and I take a look at when things really began to change, it was in the social culture changes. I think "will and grace" probably did more to educate the american public than almost anything anybody has ever done so far, and I think people fear that which is different. Now they're beginning to understand. 
>> As at person who is part of a -- the phenomenon that is "glee" on tv, how do you think it felt to the "will and grace" people to be mentioned in that context. 
>> I know all four of them. I'm sure they're absolutely thrilled about it. When they first did that show and nbc sat them down and said, this could possibly turn into a huge thing and you might be threatened, it might get ugly, it never happened. Never happened. And these are flawed characters. They're funny, you laugh at them, you want to go into that apartment every -- whatever night it was on, thursday night, and hang out with them. And I think that does change a lot. Like biden said, you have to kind of put us out in the culture and see who they are and if we're flawed, it has nothing to do with our orientation, it's because we're flawed people. 

[00:35:25]


>> Full human beings. Shocker. I wonder, do you think there's an extension, because you were saying as people know more gay people, as more people come out, that tends to sort of soften even very hard attitudes about gay rights. Is there an extension that as people are exposed to the reality of gay lives just through culture, through tv, through theater, whatever it is, that that also has that affect? 
>> Absolutely. People are tied to their televisions. People come up to me like they know me because I appear on their television. 
>> They want you to believe them. 
>> Exactly. Say something mean to me. They think we're their friends. So we do befriend the people on our televisions so I think it's really great that people like ryan murphy, the creator of our show, takes this very seriously and that's why he has every flavor of kid in the glee club. He wants every kid who watches this show to have somebody that they can point to and go that's me. And look I'm being supported. I'm in a place where people have my back and I get to raise my voice in song. 
>> Yeah. I always felt like one of the things that I would always try to explain to people about like what I learned from junior high and high school sf that popularity in junior high and high school doesn't buy you anything in later life. Like really you ought to look for the kids who -- like the t dorkier you are, the cooler you are in later years. 
>> If you're geeky, it's a geeky time in your life so you're being genuine. You're not trying to be something else. How many junior high or high school stars have we heard about who just fail as adults because they really haven't gone through that? They haven't gotten to know their trueself. 

[00:37:30]


>> I sort of feel like I'm waiting to feel like my trueself. I'm looking at her and it's great. 
>> It's going to be in a dark alley and it's going to be a fight when it happens. One last question about politics. That is at the same time that we've been seeing this sort of transformation in the democratic party, the president completing his evolution and all these different things. 
>> Yes. 
>> On the right in the republican party, mitt romney's actually gone the other direction in his stance on gay rights. When he ran for senate, he said he was going to be to the left of ted kennedy and now he's not only against equal marriage rights, he's against civil unions and -- 
>> we're talking together right now, he's probably against that. 
>> It's probably illegal somewhere and he supports that state's right to make it that way. I understand how people evolve on this issue. It is harder for me to understand how people devolve. 
>> I don't think you devolve on this issue. I buy it. I don't think it's genuine. I think it's politically calculated. 
>> Mitt romney -- 
>> mitt romney politically calculated I think deep down inside, I think there's a little calculus going on with him. 
>> If he wants to come on the show and talk to me or fake me, which is you, about that, that would be awesome. Jane lynch, the finale of "glee" airs next tuesday night on fox. scottrade, we believe the more you know, the better you trade.

>>> This week, this picture became a brand new idea to everybody on the internet machine. When it became a hook for the best new photographic politics meme we have had in a time. Hey girl, ryan gosling, it's madam secret the former secretary of state says so the then I sent her a text saying I think I left my favorite sunglasses in the desk. Sorry, condi, haven't seen them. This one is really good. Hey, hill, what you doing? Running the world. I love this text from hillary clinton. Fish and game authorities were able to corner the bear in somebody's yard, but not before the best new thing in the world happened. One guy, watch this, learning a vital lesson about texting and walking at the same time -- see the guy? See the guy? That's a bear. Can we see that again? In super slo-mo. There's the bear, there's the guy texting, looking down, and then he notices a little something. Oh, geez, run away. Of course, california fish and game's advice for anybody who encounters a bear is don't run away. They say face the animal, make noise, and try to appear as large as possible. But in this case, texting dude is okay. He says he wasng his boss. And also bear is okay. Tranquilized and successfully transported for release back into the wild even if it does now have an unsightly ear tag. 

[00:43:41]


>> When you are this close to hoover dam, it makes you realize how small a human is in relation to this as a human project. You can't be the state who builds this. You can't even be the town who builds this. But you can be the guy that stops something like this. We've got a project like this waiting for the president's go ahead supported by republicans and democrats, labor unions. It provides energy security and up to 130,000 jobs. 
>> National republican congressional committee, you guys nailed me. You got me exactly right. Seriously, it's uncanny. There is no poop fairy. There is no winged antennaed creature ready to swoop out of the sky. As depicted by the graphics department of the jefferson county sheriff's office which you see here. We just received word that the simultaneously disillusioning and instructive don't believe in the poop fairy complain is expanding. Now to boise, idaho. They are planning to inveil their own poop fairy campaign this spring. The poop fairy did not just get invented in colorado. Way back in 2004 an early iteration of the poop fairy was unveiled in a psa, watch this. 
>> Do your part and scoop the poop because, guess what? There's no such thing as the poop fairy. 
>> So good move boise, idaho, in adopting the poop fairy as your own. It worked great aarently in colorado and both colorado and boise, if you want to thank the original poop fairy, we know she was from virginia. She was an overheated adorably slightly overweight chocolate lab. Likor is the dutch word for yummy. So the noise the scooter makes is yummy, yummy, yumy, pizza, pizza, domino's, domino's. Watch it in action on the street. 

[00:45:56]


>> Domino's pizza. Domino's, domino's, domino's. 
>> The best part of it is that the bzz noise is just a guy going bzz. ???????????? somebody is cutting up onions in the studio obviously. Perhaps my allergies are acting up. I may need to be alone with my fenway feelings. I'm a cryer. You can't do this to me. Are you ready? The parents are named chowder and clementine. The nine children are pork chop, pickles, saffron, olive, peaches, turnip, radish, rutabaga, and kevin. Kevin? He's like the marilyn muenster of the family of the impossibly cute otters. Mr. Putin took to the rink to play in an he can hi biths game and although he was on a team of amateurs and the amateurs were playing a team of russian hockey legends, president putin's team won. Duh! But it is how his team won and his role in the glory that is important. Can your american president score a hockey goal? Look at that. Putin can. Seriously, can we look at that? Can we look at that for a second? Here is the first pass, right? And there is president putin missing it. While here, far, far away in hockey terms is the defender. Way out there. The defender from the team of the country's best players. All the other defenders are covering their men but their men are not president of russia. The president's defender keeps a safe distance from him. After another pass the president left completely alone scores the goal, no defender in sight. Yes, it's good to be king. An emergency financial manager in charge of the detroit schools decided katherine ferguson academy was going to be closed. The young women decided they were not having it. They started protesting, including in some cases getting arrested. We started reporting on their fight to keep this very ambitious school open and in june of last year those girls and their founding principal, they won their fight. They kept katherine ferguson academy's doors open. They won and them winning that fight last year means that this is possible this year. Yesterday, 24 young women suited up in white robe they put on their mortar boards, got their diplomas handed to them by miss andrews. All of today's graduates have applied for college. Congratulations katherine ferguson academy class of 2012. You would not be here had you not fought for it and by fighting for it, you won. Best new thing in the world today. Definitely not the best hockey game in the world but for pure, pure thor tearian hubris, it is definitely the best new thing in the world today. Kevin, the asian small clod otter. The endangered species of the boy named sue. One of these otters is not like the other otters is the best new thing in the world. Happy 100th birthday fenway park. The mother of all poop fairies. Best new thing in the world today. Go, boise, go. This close encounter between a texter and the nature, geez, best new thing in the world. Especially the hair. You totally got my hair exactly right because this is what I my hair looks like. Best new thing in the world today. Best new thing in the world today. Best new thing in the world. We've got more ahead. Please stay with us. rosa chantix. When the doctor told me that I could smoke for the first week... I'm like...Yeah, ok... Little did I know that one week later I wasn't smoking. 

[00:51:49]


[ Male Announcer ] ALONG WITH SUPPORT, Chantix is proven to help people quit smoking. It reduces the urge to smoke. Some people had changes in behavior, thinking or mood, hostility, agitation, depressed mood and suicidal thoughts or actions while taking or after stopping chantix. If you notice any of these stop taking chantix and call your doctor right away. Tell your doctor about any history of depression or other mental health problems, which could get worse while taking chantix. Don't take chantix if you've had a serious allergic or skin reaction to it. If you develop these stop taking chantix and see your doctor right away as some can be life-threatening. If you have a history of heart or blood vessel problems, tell your doctor if you have new or worse symptoms. Get medical help right away if you have symptoms of a heart attack. Use caution when driving or operating machinery. Common side effects include nausea, trouble sleeping and unusual dreams. It helps to have people around you... They say, you're much bigger than this. And you are. 
[ Male Announcer ] ASK YOUR DOCTOR IF CHANTIX Is right for you. 
>>> One of the things I love best about what I do for a living is that it is almost impossible to predict what's going to take off, and people who are trying to make a particular thing take off don't always get their way. Sometimes some other force takes hold. And it's especially true in a year like 2012 in an election year. In the wake of the incredibly important debate between the candidates and it ended up that the topic that everybody was talking about in all of politics was big bird. After everything else, after all the tens of hundreds of millions of dollars spent to make people talk about whatever these guys wanted them to talk about, the 2012 race for president ended up for a while being brought to you by the letter "b." Things happen. Just as this show every night is brought to you by a huge number of hugely talented and hard-working people who you do not necessarily see on camera but without whom I could not do what I do even for a minute. The best staff in all of cable television works on this tv show. I don't know what I did to deserve it but I am very, very, very grateful for it. I am nothing without these guys. And none of us would be here at all if you weren't here watching. So from all of us here at the rachel maddow show, thank you. Thank you for watching the show. We love our jobs, and you make it possible for us to have them. Happy new year. ???????????? ???????????? ???????????? ???????????? ???????????? ???????????? ???????????? ???????????? ???????????? ????????????

=======================================================

Hese of representatives are working on aending a last-minute bill passed early this morning by the senate. I'm richard lui, you're watching msnbc's continuing coverage of the fiscal cliff deal. Eric cantor eming from a meeting saying he does not support the senate-passed bill. House speaker bonn janer is not likely to bring the senate bill to the floor without changes is what we're hearing and in a statement boehner's spokesman said the speaker and leader laid out options to the members and listened to feedback. The lack of spending cuts in the senate bill was our universal concern amongst members in today's meetings. Conversations will continue throughout the afternoon on the path forward. Outgoing republican congressman steven latourette told nbc's luke russert the senate bill did not stand much of a bill in the house. Take a listen. 
>> I think it's a little unreasonable for senator reid to say that something they produced on new year's eve, produced by a bunch of p-deprived octogenarians is what we should adopt within 48 hours. Et's bring in mike viqueira. We understand there have been meetings throughout the afternoon. 
>> Reporter: The future of this bill, the deal to avert the fsk fiscal cliff and is in turmoil. Here is what's happening right now. House republican leadership has just concluded a meeting in the speaker's suite of offices in the usa capitol. They have called a second meeting of all house republicans that's due to start at 5:15 in about 15 minutes. They're going to review their options, what can be done. Meanwhile, a senate aide tells me that the senate is done. They are gone for the 112th congress that expires on noon thursday. If the house chooses to amend the senate bill, as you reported, it was sent over at 2:00 after an overwhelming bipartisan vote of 89-8, this senate aide tells me the senate is not going to take it up, and house republicans are going to be responsible for, quote, the largest tax increase in american history. If that is a fact, if that is not a bluff, we are at serious crossroads. Here are how things unfolded today. After the senate passed that bill by 89-8 once more, 5 republicans voted against it, 3 democrats voted against it, but other than that across the political spectrum it had support in the senate. This deal brokered by vice president biden and the republican leader mitch McCONNELL. House republicans huddled this morning, house democrats huddled this morning. Joe biden made another trip, his second to two days to sell democrats on the proposal. Not a lot of problems as far as we know although there are people on the left who say the president is giving up too much in terms of the income threshold over which people's taxes would rise, but putting that aside, more significantly, house speaker john boehner and the majority leader, the number two in the house, huddled their troops. We started to get reports out of that meeting that there was a lot of dissatisfaction not only with the tax hike, which after all is a tax cut today. As of midnight tonight we're talking about cutting taxes, but the spending. Not enough spending cuts in this bill to satisfy house republicans. Eric cantor has come out against the bill and so the question is now how will the house act? If they choose to amend the bill and put in spending cuts, it's got to be sent back to the senate, and that's where that statement from that senate aide comes in. If the senate does not act, everything lapses in the 112th congress at noon on thursday when the new congress is sworn inwhat that means, chard, is that they've got to start the legislative process all over again, and all the turmoil and all the back and forth and the late nights and the negotiations we've seen hanging by a thread that have gone up to literally the last minute and really beyond the last minute are going to have to start all over again. Today is a holiday obviously. People are not feeling the impact of what's going on here. The markets open tomorrow. People are going to go back to work getting their paychecks that will see a much bigger bite taken out of them if congress cannot agree because of the higher taxes, those bush tax cuts that are going to lapse. 

[00:04:08]


>> This congress, as you have been telling us, they now have 43 hours to get something done and so many people are watching what's happening there in washington, d.C. Mike viqueira, thank you so much. We'll be talking to you later. Joining us now is congressman john yarmuth, democrat from kentucky. Thanks for being with us today. A lot happening with your gop friends across the aisle as they are trying to put together perhaps an amendment is what our reporters are telling us. You and I have spoken othe last week several times, and earlier today you said something that you have said before. Speaker boehner, you know, has taken on some bravery here. You give him some credit for that you said this morning. You called him courageous for being willing to send this deal to the floor. Now that we're hearing these latest developments, excuse me, these latest developments, what's your thought about house republicans and they're signaling they're going to send it back to the senate? 
>> Well, richard, I think a couple things are clear. One is, yeah, I did think that speaker boehner was acting very courageously when he said he would bring the senate bill to the floor. Now he's not willing to do that, so I probably have to retract what I said just about ten hours ago. But what's really disturbing is there apparently is absolutely no leadership among congressional republicans. I KNOW mitch McConnell very well, known him for a long time. I didn't think there was any way he would put his neck out for this deal unless he was absolutely confident that the republicans in the houould have ratified it. I think the fact that they're not indicates to me that this house republican conference is so ideologically driven that they would basically scorch the earth in defense of their own ideology, and the american people are the ones that are going to suffer, seniors, throughout the spectrum of the economy. Businesses large and small if we let this thing go over the cliff and don't repair it very quickly. I think everybody on our sidef the aisle is baffled that this deal which again passed 89-8 in the senate last night could not -- they couldn't even bring 40 or 50 republican votes to the floor of the house tonight because we would have passed it with those votes. 

[00:06:12]


>> There were some republicans that luke russert had heard from, one member. He said they were absolutely incredulous that some of the things that were being said by those who oppose this deal during this gop conference. You take that incredulity that some republicans are seeing, you look at your caucus, is there any way that this might make it to the floor and we put the majority of the majority to a side for a moment and you cobble together perhaps the votes from both democrats and a portion of the republicans in the house? Do you see that as at all possible? 
>> Well, it's possible, but, again, I think it's going to require -- just based on the reporting that we're hearing and reading, it's going to depend on whether speaker boehner will say to his conference, look, i pledged to bring this to the floor. We were negotiating in good faith. We're going to put this on the floor and let the chips fall where they may. The other thing that's disturbing is, I mean, I don't know what world they're living in, these members who think they can amend the bill and do anything but kill it. They know that that is the death knell of the agreement because the senate is, as you have reported, has gone home. 
>> What sort of spending cuts might you be open to considering if this does come to pass as we are hearing at the moment? 
>> Well, right now I think we've got on the table the sequester is $1.2 trillion worth of cuts over the next -- $1.04 trillion I guess and nobody seems to want to do that. You know, the irony is republicans say they want to cut spending, but they don't want to cut what the american people want to cut which is defense spending and some of the huge corporate subsidies that permeate our tax code. They say we need to deal with medicare and medicaid and social security but they know the american people don't want to cut those. Talking is cheap and, you know, I think on our side of the aisle, we're firmly committed to seeing reasonable cuts in defense spending and, again, also to things like the oil company subsidy,ig agra business subsidies. I think that's where our caucus is pretty much unanimous. 

[00:08:26]


>> Thank you so much. I appreciate your time. 
>> Okay, richard. 
>> Congressman john yarmuth in a busy time in washington, d.C. Also in washington, d.C. Is e.J. Deon, senior fellow at the brookings institute and msnbc contributor. Thanks for joining us. 
>> Happy new year. 
>> Happy new year to you, too. We have some tngs to talk about on this day. When we look at the house republican conference meeting this afternoon, they're about to undertake another one in about seven or eight minutes, we'll be watching that closely, you look at the folks you have there. You have john boehner, you have the republican speaker of the house there not speaking up or voicing his opinion on the senate's bill. You have eric cantor, the number two republican in the house, saying he'sst it. When you see this balance, it sort of reminds us of this duality the two have had over recent years. Is this cantor basically pushing boehner out in front? 
>> You did have a suspicion when this news first broke that cantor might be preparing to run against boehner for speaker, but I just don't think that's going to happen. It's possible, but that would be surprising. But this whole business is surprising because as congressman yarmuth said, the last thing you expected was that the house republicans were going TO SLAP mitch McConnell in the face. You can't get more bipartisan than an 89-8 vote. There were only eight senators and only five republicans who voted against it. You would think that if speaker boehner would actually allow this to the floor and if he said, look, do we want this or do weigh want $3.5 trillion in tax increases? Do we want this or do we want a stock market to crash, they could find republican votes because I think if this doesn't pass and things go very bad over the next few days, it's going to be the house republicans who own it, and it's hard to believe theyant to do that, but it appears that their ideological sort of commitments are going to push them in that direction, at least they are as of the time they went into that meeting. You wonder what's going to be said in that meeting. 

[00:10:34]


>> You know, e.J., If you look at the -- what has happened over the last 12, 14 hours, are there items perhaps that have caused us to come to this point where we're looking at the gop caucus now reconsidering or considering for the first time what came over from the senate, that strongly bipartisan bill. For instance, a number that came out was the cbo. They had put an estimate, a cost at some $3.7 trillion. Do you think that might be hanging heavy on some of those tea party republicans as they consider this bill that came over from the senate? 
>> It might be but if you did what they wanted to do and kept all of the tax increase -- tax cuts, you'd add $4.6 trillion to the deficit. So this can't really be about the deficit even if that's what they're telling themselves. You know, there are 30 to 60 really, really conservative republicans in that caucus, and if you're going to give them a kind of veto power, you're never going to get anything through the house in the next two years that can pass the senate. This is a real crisis of governance and it looked like boehner was facing up to that. Congressman yarmuth had praised him ten hours ago because you could pass something, I think, with a modest number of republican votes. So I think this meeting they're having now, it could be about tactics, about how to teal with the mes we're about to go into, but there may be some republicans standing up and saying do we really want to throw us over the cliff in this way? I think this is one of the most important meetings the republican party has had since their convention and maybe more so. 
>> E.J., We have one more minute. I want to get your perspective on this. If it does go back to the senate, is it dead for the 112th? What's your thought here? 
>> I think it's dead. I think these are kind of poison pill amendments. The senate has gone home. They did a bipartisan thing. I think if this does not pass the house, then we're going into the new congress. 

[00:12:37]


>> All right. Thank you so much. I appreciate your time. E.J. Dionne. 
>> Good to be with you. 
>> Happy new year to you. >>Ou. 
>>> Stay with msnbc throughout the day for the latest on the fiscal cliff negotiations. Again, the bipartisan bill 89-8 coming from the senate. That was passed at 2:00 this morning. It does not look good right now when it comes to the house. We had heard from the number two republican, eric cantor, that he cannot support it as-is and we also have heard from our own luke russert that based on what one member told him, 40 members from the gop conference stood up and spoke. 37 of those 40 were against the senate bill that came over 89-8. Now, if it does get amended as we have just been discussing with mike viqueira and e.J. Dionne, the question is will the senate take that up. We are hearing right now they will not. We'll continue to cover this issue for you. The fiscal cliff negotiations. We'll be right back with "hardball." patients question, why does my mouth feel dryer than I remember it to be? There are more people taking more medication, so we see people suffering from dry mouth more so. We may see more cavities, bad breath, oral irritation. A dry mouth sufferer doesn't have to suffer. I would recommend biotene. The enzymes in biotene products help supplement enzymes that are naturally in saliva. Biotene helps moisten those areas that have become dry. E that are suffering can certainly benefit from biotene. 

[00:15:37]


>>> The rising political star of 2013, chris hayes, who will that be? 
>> Massachusetts senator elizabeth warren I think. It's not an easy thing to do what she did. I think people -- she was a star on this network and among progressives, but to go win statewide office particularly as a woman in massachusetts, that takes some doing and I think she'll be an absolute force. 
>> Steve, the rising star? 
>> It mains me a bit to say because I'm not that much of a fan but this is going to be the year when cory booker makes his year. He's goi to run for governor or decide to run against -- 
>> not just in new jersey. Krystal, the rising star? 
>> New congresswoman from hawaii, tulsi gabbard. She's the first hindu american in congress. 
>> Never heard of this person. 
>> Really amazing woman. Combat veterans. 
>> Alex, the rising star. 
>> I ask you to go with chris first because I thought it would provide me some cover. I was going to say elizabeth warren. 
>> Sure you were. 
>> It's true. 
>> Do you want to give up going first again? 
>> I would like to go first again. 
>> You go first next time. I am going to agree with alex wagner, not chris hayes, alex wagner. We're going to be back with more of the last word holiday party. Stay with us. ?????? Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah ?????? 

[00:18:25]


>>> the literati send out their minions to do their bidding. Washington cannot tolerate threats from outsiders who might disrupt their comfortable world. The fire fight started when the cowardly sensed weakness. A lesser person could not have survived the first few minutes of the onslaught. But out of the billowing smoke and dust have tweets and trivia emerged gingrich. That, of course, was the best actual political theater of 2012, tony award winner tony lithgow's reed ra he hadding -- reading of a new gingrich press release. We are going to start with alex wagner. 
>> It was the best because i couldn't believe it was happening in mid-august. Mitt romney took to the whiteboard to explain what he was doing with medicare. Which in and of itself was a hoax but the notion that this man would have this horribly staged managed moment in an effort to show he was all about business just completely blew up in his face and cemented every narrative out there. 
>> I don't know if the mikes can pick it up but drinks are being spilled over there at the table. 
>> Joy reid. 
>> Krystal ball, the best political theater. 
>> I also have a newt gingrich moment. When he turned questions abo him asking his former wife for an open marriage, parlayed that into a debate moment, a huge applause moment at a debate and then parlayed that into an actual victory in the south carolina primary. It was incredible. 
>> We happen to have that video cued up. Let's take a look at newt. 

[00:20:25]


>> She says you asked her, sir, to enter into an open marriage. Would you like to take some time to respond to that? 
>> No, but I will. 
[ Applause ] I think the destructive, vicious, negative nature of much of the news media makes it harder to govern this country, harder to attract decent people to run for public office, and i am appalled that you would begin a presidential debate on a topic like that. 
[ Applause ] >>t was obviously my choice, too, for best political theater. That's why we had that ready. Steve, best political theater. 
>> And I remember that my favorite thing about that episode was it turned out in the reporting afterwards that when they went to a commercial break, gingrich went up to john king and was like, no hard feelings. 
>> There shouldn't have been. 
>> It was very helpful to him. 
>> It really was theater. My favorite moment was in the final presidential debate when mitt romney thought he had landed the killer blow against barack obama. 
>> Oh, yes. 
>> On libya. Failure to call it a terrorist attack. 
>> Started physically closing in. 
>> That line when obama knew exactly what was happening, exactly the trap, and he says, governor, proceed. 
>> Please proceed, governor. 
>> We don't have that cued up in deo. Chris? 
>> I thought the entire democratic convention was pretty flawlessly done from the pure perspective of theatrics, especially compared to the republican convention. I specifically thought bill clinton's speech, I thought that was -- it was kind of political theater at its best in so far as it was genuinely edifying. He didn't do the cheap and easy thing which was surfacey. He went into the weeds of the details of the policy and explained them and it actually made for great theater. 

[00:22:26]


>> Worst political theater. 
>> I can't believe we haven't mentioned it before, herman cain's entire campaign. He was never nning. It was theatrics. He was an actor on the national stage. At the end of the day it was theater. 
>> Wor snst. 
>> First, I want to point out this is water before I get a lot of tweets. 
>> We are the water drinkers. 
>> Water team. So worst political theater, i would say after the 47% comments came out and mitt romney decided to do this hurried press conference where he looked frazzled, the hair was a little askew and he really had nothing to say and essentially dug the hole deeper for himself. I think that was the worst political theater of the campaign other than clint eastwood. 
>> Right after the critical michigan primary, the romney primary is on the ropes. The romney campaign says we're going to turn it around with a major economic speech and they rent out the detroit lions football stadium, 55,000 seats and there's about.0002% full. The wide shot was one of the most hilarious things I have ever seen. 
>> Chris, worst political theater? 
>> I think it was the numbers of the president's campaign after first debate. Very, very, ver gamely attempting to put a happy face on the performance. 
>> For me it was a particular moment in the herman cain campaign. It was when he had stuff twirling around in his head. 
>> So you agreed with president obama on libya or not? 
>> Okay, libya. President obama supported the uprising, correct? I do not agree with the way he handled it for the following reason. No, that's a different one. I got to go back and see. Got all this stuff twirling around in my head. 

[00:24:45]


>> Oh, we miss him so badly. We're going to be back with more of the biggest surprise of 2012, donald trump person of the year award. 

[00:28:13]


>>> And the sorry to see you go category. Chris hayes. 
>> Legendary major league baseball union president marvin miller who died this year at 95. I got the pleasure of interviewing him last year when I was working on my book. Totally and completely transformed and revolutionized both major league baseball and professional sports and converted a system that was essentially indentured servitude in which owners could basically pay players nothing into the modern free agent system in which players can actually recoup a fair market value for the value they add to the owners. 
>> Steve, sorry to see you go? 
>> Joe early was a congressman from worcester, massachusetts, he was my kind of politician and my kind of congressman. He cared about that city. He brought lots of money back, projects back and he lost his career in a trumped up fake scandal that rick santorum and john boehner created. He lost his career, his reputation. He was put on trial, w exonerated but spent the last 20 years totally unappreciated and he died this year and I think he dees at least a little recognition. 
>> Krystal? 
>> Phyllis diller. 
>> Alex, sorry to see you go? 
>> I have two. george McGovern and robby shancar. Very different men. Their losses will be felt in different worlds but they were kingmakers. 
>> And I'm very sorry to see go whitney houston. 
>> Yeah. 
>> We're going to be back with more of our last word holiday show. line, ]

[ Male Announcer ] THE RHYTHM OF LIFE. 
[ whistle blowing ] WHERE DO YOU HEAR THAT Beat? Campbell's healthy request soup lets you hear it... In your heart. 
[ basketball bouncing ] HEART HEALTHY. Great taste. Mmm... 
[ Male Announcer ] SOUNDS GOOD. It's amazing what soup can do. 

[00:33:04]


>>> Welcome back to the last word holiday party. Our new category is the biggest surprise of 2012. Karen finney, what was the biggest surprise of 2012? 
>> That we were able to call the election right around 11:00. 
>> You know, I wasn't surprised by that. 
>> You weren't sp surprised? 
>> That's what I thought would happen. 
>> I thought it would be a much longer night and I really thought it was going to be a much bigger mess and I did not think the president was going to be able to win without us having some debacle in florida. Thankfully we didn't. 
>> The biggest surprise was mitt romney actually chose paul ryaned a his running mate. You have to say iaid on a very last word on this very show in the after show to this show and I think I was with ari, you know, who should romney pick? Pick paul ryon. Ideological he's the right guy but as a democrat I was secretly like please pick ryan. 
>> Thereto were so many reasons not to pick him. >>s A DEMOCRAT IT WAS THE Perfect thing because it crystallized all the things that democrats didn't like about mitt romney and the case they wanted to make about him, this sort of distaste for the ordinary person, for the 47%, the idea of voucherizing medicare, all of that was crystallized in one person and he picked him to be his running mate. I was very surprised. 
>> Ari, biggest surprise of 2012? 
>> The biggest spris to me was something that was way behind the scenes. The debate commission makes these rules and they're usually secret. This year they leaked, first on time and gawker.Com. It turns out the debate rules restrict the moderator from doing any fact checking or any commenting or response to the answers the candidates give and we never knew that before because it's this secret cabal between the candidates and the commission. It's crooked and I think sort of very untransparent in a lot of ways. We learned that and I think next cycle there's going to be a lot of pressure to change the rules. 
>> I hate the rules and did a couple rewrites on the show about the rules. My biggest surprise of 2012 was president obama's performance in the fir debate. I kind of went what? 

[00:35:15]


>> That was everyone's -- 
>> and it didn't completely start to settle on me until we were about 50 minutes in. Because I was kind of -- you're kind of waiting for the engine to start and it didn't quite -- 
>> it's going to -- and then it didn't. 
>> It was amazing. 
>> I think they were so confident in their math in the obama campaign they didn't go into that debate taking it all that seriously and I don't think he thought why am I here with that guy. 
>> It's that incumbent president thing. That first debate is always, oh, boy, I'm so out of shape at this. 
>> Rusty. 
>> He didn't take eye contact seriously either. He was sort of -- >>yeah. Now, here is the -- this comes to our annual donald trump award. Donald trump has been winning this award for the last 20 years on the show. And so it's been named after him. It is the most embarrassing -- the person who has embarrassed himself or herself the most in the year 2012. 
>> At least he's consistent. 
>> For you, karen, this year the donald trump award goes to -- 
>> I have to say herman cain. 
>> Yeah. 
>> In that interview when he couldn't remember. 
>> In that video we just saw. 
>> Maybe a close second with governor perry with trying to remember the three agencies. Ouch, ouch, ouch. It just hurt. It hurt. 
>> And the difference is perry actually was running for president and cain was running for fame. Joy, the donald trump award? 
>> Since karen took the two that I would have taken. John sununu. He was the worst surrogate i have ever seen in my house. He was everything that's wrong with the republican party's brand. Surly and condescending and racialsensitive and ug will I and he kept talking. 
>> Ari, the donald trump award goes to who this year? 
>> My trump award goes to karl rove. 
>> Oh, yeah. 
>> On election night? 
>> On politics -- both, on politics election night he had no idea what was going on. On. Si this was the year when we really saw the public turn against his enduring legacy of trying to write discrimination into state constitutions against people who happened to be gay. The republic and republican party are turning against that. That's going to be his legacy for a long time on this civil rights issue. 

[00:37:26]


>> As I said, for 20 years here on the show the donald trump award has gone to donald trump and once again I feel I will be giving it to donald trump. Because I do find the impossible to outdo donald trump on embarrassing yourself. There are a couple people who tried to outdo donald trump. Let's take a l at, for example, todd akin. 
>> Oh, yeah. 
>> First of all, from what i understand from doctors, that's really rare. If it's a legitimate rape, the female body has ways to try to shut that whole thing down. 
>> And just when you thought he had that whole jurisdiction wrapped up, there came richard murdoch. I think it is something that god intended to happen. 
>> They are legitimate runners-up for the donald trump award. 
>> Why did he sound ill? He always sounds like he's not feeling well on top of it. 
>> There were a number of male, mostly male, republican legislators in state legislatures across the country who made similar country who can reameless but let's give them a hat tip about being that stupid about women. 
>> How about the people who wrote the republican party's platform this year? They completely agreed. 
>> Coming up, the person who we are not sorry to see go. Also, we will be picking the person of the year, biggest winner, biggest loser. Stay with us. diabetes... Your doctor will say get smart about your weight. I tried weight loss plans... But their shakes aren't always made for people with diabetes. THAT'S WHY THERE'S Glucerna Hunger Smart Shakes. They have carb steady, with carbs that digest slowly to help minimize blood sugar spikes. And they have six grams of sugars. With fifteen grams of protein to help manage hunger... Look who's getting smart about her weight. 

[00:39:33]


[ Male Announcer ] Glucerna Hunger Smart. A smart way to help manage hunger and diabetes. ] likes market. She also likes to ride her bike. Snows the potential for making or losing money can pop up anytime. That's why she trades with the leader in mobile trading. So she's always ready to take action, no matter how wily... Or weird... Or wonderfully the market's behaving... Which isn't rocket science. It's just common sense. From td ameritrade. 
>>> Now for the not sorry to see you go category. Ari melber, who are you not sorry to see go? 
>> Alan west. 
>> You took mine. 
>> You took my answer -- 
>> mine, too. 
>> Now people know this is real. 
>> All right. Alan west. Yeah. Joy -- 

[00:41:34]


>> that was my answer. 
>> Who was your runner up? 
>> I guess my runner up has to be dick morris. I think we're rid of him. 
>> I don't know. 
>> He's sort of like a bad penny. 
>> I think he's just hibernating. 
>> Maybe he can o blooib blige us and go away. 
>> Karen nney? 
>> I think I'm going to have to GO WITH jim DeMint. 
>> He's going to disappear. This nonsense this is a better job than being senator. He's going to run a stupid foundation in d.C. It's actually kind of great to get rid of him. And the people who are really not sorry to see him go are republicans in the senate who he was driving crazy. Democrats in the senate actually liked having a nut like that to kind of paint the whole party. 
>> Can I give a runner-up now. The tea party, the funny hats, the loud, obnoxious rallies. 
>> And they have functionally disappeared. 
>> Basically. 
>> They had nothing to say during the fiscal cliff crisis. We'll be back with the picks for person of the year biggest winner, biggest loser, a lot more. Stay with us. prepaid me. ?????? ?????? I have direct deposit on my visa prepaid. My paycheck is loaded right on my card. Automatic. I am not going downtown standing in line to cash it. I know where my money is, because it is in my pocket. I got more time with my daughter, we got places to go. 

[00:44:12]


[ man ] GO OPEN A NEW WORLD, With visa prepaid. More people go with visa. 
>>> Welcome back to the last word holiday party. It's now time for the person of the year award. Ari melber, who was the person of the year? 
>> I was think being this. It's a night for celebration but I think it's also a night to honor people and for me when you look at 2012 it would be congresswoman gabrielle giffords. She resigned this year after a heroic battle dealing with the gunshot wounds that she experienced. We obviously keep her in our thoughts and our prayers, but she was also a leader and believed in public policy and we're going to have to look as we go forward into the next year over how we deal with this enduring problem of gun violence in our country. 
>> Joy reid? 
>> This may sound a little corny but I pickedyear the american voter. 
>> It does sound corny. 
>> It does sound corny. 
>> You said a group. You didn't say the country. 
>> It's a group. 
>> It's very "time" magazine. 
>> It is. But I never in mylitime have to see people endure so many hoops, so many obstructions. 
>> Seven hours in line. 
>> Ait, nine. 
>> And a the overt, I have never seen it so overt, whether it was in ohio db. 
>> You're winning me over. This is not corny. 
>> When people fought against the right to vote this cycle than I have ever seen in my life, I felt like I was being TRANSPORTED BACK TO THE 1960s OR THE '50s, AND IN FLORIDA WHERE They passed legislation preventing black voters from being able to vote. I thought people's resilience, people's resolve, people's determination, I met 60-year-old people, older women, people who had disabilities who said I'm staying in line if it has to be all da i. I was very proud of them. It's corny but -- 

[00:46:12]


>> no, it's not. You beat me on that. 
>> The I am imagines were the most powerful, people waiting in line. 
>> Karen finney? 
>> Mine is ma la la. She reminded us about things that are far more important in ternls of what the big struggles in this world are about and particularly at a time when republicans were trying to tell women that this war on women is all in our heads. I think it was a good reminder for women what we have fought for and what we continue to fight for. 
>> She was shot in the head by the pakistani taliban because she wants education for girls and women. We have someeo of her. Let's take a look at that. 
>> I have a new dream, so thought I must be a politician to serve this country. 
>> Why did you change this dream? 
>> Because there's so many crises in our country, so I want to remove these crises and to serve my country. 
>> And you'll notice there's a little person of the year bug on the video because she is my ce for person of the year which is why we had that video ready to go. Krystal ball, your person of the year? You can just say I agree. You can. There's nothing wrong with that. 
>> I have to go with -- I know mine is corny too, but I have to go with president obama. He really survived a lot of adversity. He really I think was vindicated in a lot of ways. 
>> I don't think you ever have to make the case for the president being the person of the year. Wagner? 
>> I am really boring but I was echo krystal because I think he's comported himself with so much honesty and kindness. 
>> Steve you're the tiebreaker because there's two with us -- 
>> I'm not breaking any tie. I'm going on my own "family feud" style. I'm saying john roberts, the supreme court chief justice because at the height of an election season with immense pressure from the conservative movement and peer pressure from within the court, this guy said the affordable care act, it stands. 
>> Good point. 

[00:48:13]


>> Coming up, we're going to have the biggest winner, the biggest loser. That's a different concept than person of the year. Think about this. That's coming up. We're going to be right back with more of the last word holiday party."The last word" holiday party. plays ] 
[ ship horn blows ] no, no, no! Stop! Humans. One day we're coming up with the theory of relativity, the next... Not so much. But that's okay -- you're covered with great ideas like optional better car replacement from liberty mutual insurance. Total your car and we give you the money to buy one a model year newer. Learn about it at libertymutual.Com. Liberty mutual insurance. Responsibility. What's your policy? ???????????? 

[00:51:41]


>>> welcome back to "the last word" holiday party. We are now going to pick our biggest winner and biggest loser of 2012. I'm going to break the routine. I'm going to go first. 
>> Okay. 
>> One reason I'm going first on biggest loser is because my choice is wicked obvious. Okay? And there's no sense waiting around for the big suspense of my decision. 
>> Just drop the bomb. 
>> I am choosing willard mitt romney. I'm doing that because the man lived his entire life for this year to be the republican nominee. His father told him go out and get rich, mitt. And then run for office. You know, when you can afford to. So he followed his father's plan. He ignored a lot of what his father actually thought about politics and governing. Things like letting people see your tax returns, 12 years of them which his father did. So mitt romney after having lived his life to do this to run his campaign is now at home tonight with his tax returns. He is the biggest -- he's the biggest loser in america. 
>> But he won that battle. 
>> Biggest loser. Anybody who was taking their cues from the romney campaign polls in the last couple of weeks and was out there talking about 300 electoral votes. That was really fun. 
>> It was a close tie. I thought about paul ryan. Being associated with the biggest loser is almost as bad as being the biggest loser. 
>> Losing on the vice presidential ot, there's nowhere to go. 
>> It was a tie between him and rupert murdoch. This year his entire news empire was exposed for the fraud it is. They were literally humiliated. Their narrative of the campaign proved to be completely false. Now their credibility is in tatters. And you had the phone hacking scandal. He's just a mess right now. So I'm giving him the tie slight edge over ryan. 

[00:53:46]


>> Biggest loser? 
>> For me it was a long time coming. Member when I first started working for marie cantwell on the held. We would have proposals or be discussing things. People would say you can't do that because of the pledge. I said I didn't know. What's the pledge? What is the pledge. I guess I need to learn about it. And the pledge is slowly, not completely -- 
>> grover norquist. 
>> Grover norquist anti-tax pledge which is no way to run a business, no way to run a government. Revenues are important if you understand a balance sheet. That thing has haunted us for a long time. 
>> Krystal ball, the biggest loser. 
>> Mine has helped in part helped rupert murdoch which is karl rove. Many people thought even if they didn't like him, he was very smart. He exposed himself to not be very smart on election night on the other network. 
>> We only have two people left who might please me by choosing donald trump. Let's see what happens. Your biggest loser of 2012? 
>> Donald trump. It's not, it's not. 
>> Correct! You get the ipad. 
>> I hate to disappoint you. It's sheldon adelson. 
>> Yes. 
>> And the house lost big. 
>> That was great. 
>> Steve kornacki, the biggest. 
>> I want an ipad, but my biggest loser is the name that was for generatiohe gold standard in public opinion polling. Gallup. And for all of october right up to election day said romney has an advantage and is going to win this race. They had about six two weeks for the election. People are going to look for skeptically coming up. 
>> Biggest winner. Again, I'm going to go first because once again, I couldn't be more obvious. I just think the guy who wins the presidential election is really, you know, by every measure the biggest winner. And he did it with this crushing unemployment rate on his administration which he did everything he could possibly do to fix. But he didn't have it politically fixed by the time he went into re-election. He got re-elected with an unemployment number that everybody thought was impossible. So that credit goes to president obama. Biggest winner of 2012 for me. Karen finny. 

[00:56:13]


>> I'm going with the home team and say msnbc because we kicked that other network. 
>> Don't even try to get the ipad. She gets the ipad. 
>> You previewed mine. Was going to say nate silver. Because I think math was a huge winner this year. He looked at the numbers and polls properly. He understood the relative weight of gallup and better polls. The people who understood that if 28% of the electorate was going to be minority and if the president could pull 80% of that electorate he could win. And nate silver understand that for a very long time. You were quoting him every night on this show. He's a big winner. 
>> Ari, the biggest winner of 2012. 
>> I want to pick up on joy's flavor. You put her on blast tonight for being corny. And I'm going to be corny with you now. 
>> Okay. Join me. 
>> And say government intervention in our economy was the biggest winner. Barack obama came in office after tremendous elite failure, fundamental distrust of what our government can do. And he basically -- if you really boil it down, he outlined a series of proposals that intervened in our markets, the health care market, insurance market, car market. And each one of those things has worked and he's won over a public that we know is angry and skeptical. You said he's the guy because he won. I'm saying part of what he did was reknew a faith in what we knew we need. 
>> Krystal ball. 
>> I was attempted also to go with barack obama, but I'm going TO TAKE claire McCaskill. She'd been written off. Nobody thought she could win that seat again in missouri. She won the crazy candidate jackpot and was smart and strategic about how she parlayed that into a victory. But I think she is a big winner by being back in the senate. 
>> Biggest winner of 2012. 
>> Hillary rodham clinton. 2016. She's the teflon donna. You can't touch her. 

[00:58:18]


>> No. That's good. Steve kornacki. 
>> I'm going to piggyback on what you said earlier. I think the biggest winner of 2012 was the biggest winner of 1968. George romney. He exited with his politics in tatters. And the son by failing to live up to his father resuscitated george romney. I think the public's estimation of george romney emerges in a much better place this year than it was before this election. 
>> That's a good one. I like that. So gang, thank you all for a great year here on "the last word." You've all been doing this for the last 15 years of this particular holiday show. The first generation of guests have all kind of moved on to other things. But there will be many more of these "last word" holiday shows to come. Thank you, all. There's "the last word" staff over there. Just to make it official, you all agreed with every pick that I made, right? Okay. Good. Right. Thank you for joining us for "the last word" holiday party. A lot more in 2013. ????????????

=======================================================

>>> This deal we have in place, while it makes permanent the tax issue that will be taken off the table for a long time, this is just the first of three with the big fights that will occur on capitol hill. The debt limit in early march, a government funding bill ahead of that. There is a question about the automatic spending cuts. The sequester was the most difficult thing to figure out in this temporary compromise. We only had a two-month one. These are questions we do not know. President obama will most likely speak tonight. A sigh of relief, but this is the beginning of the beginning for what will be a very, very partisan trencrfare the next three works months in washington d.C. . They say this is bipartisanship and how democracy and the republican response to work, but listen, there will be a lot more of these. If we go to the very last minute on this one, where a lot of folks thought that republicans would want to compromjse with the president because he had so much leverage, just imagine what happens on something like the debt limit or the republicans feel they have leverage. 23 hours into the new year, just for those joining us, the gavel just went down. They have just declared that the senate bill, that the house has not concurred with it, that it has passed. It will go to the president for signature there. The real question to look for is, speaker maynor said, we will send it to -- not it is up to the senate. That is what they were saying, yet we were debating whether he was bringing it to the floor. Was he actually thinking that he would not have to do that and then you add the element of cantor coming out against that and the complexities that existed. They are very nuanced. 

[00:02:02]


>> What america was afforded today, folks that were paying attention to this and what they got on the news was really kind of a microcosm of the house republican conference. You saw that today. You saw boehnev's leadership style and a sense of letting his members event. You saw eric kanter being with the conference. Then you saw the pragmatic old bulls who have been there for a while that did not want to be blamed for going overhe fiscal cliff. Everyone got to see that in its entirety today. As far as going forward, richard, I think that those battles in the house republican conference are still very much alive it. They only lost eight seats. I believe a vast majority of them got over 55% in their districts. They will be reelected quite easily. Their worries from a primary challenger on the right. Going forward, folks will have to realize when people say why want the compromise? Because they see any compromise any time they are with president obama, and some will get flak for being too close to political interest. Last thing, this is a deal that was opposed by the afl-cio and also imposed by the heritage action, the very conservative group that has a very influential scorecard here on capitol hill. You seefar left, far right, move on.Org, they did not like this. Some folks say both extremes don't like it. We will see what effect that has on members moving forward. 
>> We are just learning that speaker boehner voted for this as well as paul ryan voted for this. Eric cantor did not vote for it. He voted against it. 
>> While. 
>> That is what we understand right now. What is the next cep, and when will the president get that? If you want to comment on what we just learned about the votes from speaker boehner and paul ryan. The budget grew roll from the right voting for it and. Cantor's saying no. 

[00:04:13]


>> I think it's fairly extraordinary. There has been a lot of talk, a lot has been written and speculated upon about eric kanter and the rivalry between eric kanter and john banner. Folks happen to think -- I am getting an update here. Let me update you. This is a press release just sent out by the press office just behind me. Remarks will be open. 11:20 will get a statement here in the briefing room. You and I have been talking earlier, punctuating this long campaign, this long after that he has had to pass this bill averting the fiscal cliff. People on the left have been disappointed in the fact that he did not stick to that $250,000 threshold that he and has raced up to $450,000. But the president has a victory here tonight, I think we can say, on balance. He will be coming out here to talk to us, talk to us in just a few minutes, richard. 
>> Again, just learning, 11:20, the president will be speaking. We will have that for you on. I want to bring in e.J. Dionne. Just as we look at what the responses, columnist for "the washington post," senior fellow at the brookings institute, e.J., You and I have talked about the day, what do you make of the count, 257 to 167 in terms of an may column. We needed 217. The numbers were there. 
>> I think there are a couple of significant things that bolt luke referred to and congressman norman f. . You will have to see coalitions like you had tonight, and it's really significant that speaker boehner, in the end, after sort of allowing the rebellion to have some voice, giving the republicans time to come to terms with the fact that they were going to essentially lose on this one. They had to bring it to the floor. You had a coalition of 85 republicans and 172 democrats who pass this thing. You essentially isolated the most conservative republicans in congress along with those republicans who did not want to take a chance. What you wonder it is, will such a coalition be allowed to work again on other fiscal issues? And then the other point is that, yes, we do face two months of fighting, march madness as somebody said earlier, and there is a real difference of view on the republican and democratic psides. The republicans who supported this, look, taxes are out of the way. Now it's all about spending. The administration has said, and I suspect president obama might say it again tonight, no, no, we are not done with revenue. The president has said he needed at least 8000000000000.6 in revenue. This is only $600 billion. That's a lot of money, but is not all the way up there. They think they can get more revenue out of tax reform. As we are fighting over the sequestered over the next few months, there will be a fight over more revenue. Republicans will insist we can do it all with cuts. 

[00:07:55]


>> We are about to hear from the president for those viewers just joining us in about 12 minutes. The president taking a bit of a victory lap. Some of the criticism and questions out there is when the president did come to the camerons with middle-class voters in the background and a statement that was put on the web site after that. It seemed, from those critics out there, that perhaps it was a little too confident or did not match the tone and what needed to happen when it came to the way the sausage is made there on capitol hill. That did not help the process. Does he have to be careful with this message, given that you just mentioned those three major fiscal crisis in front of us? 
>> There are two ways to read what he did. Some argued he was too aggressive and caught republicans mad. It did not stop it. Some of that tough language was aimed at democrats who were unhappy at different aspects of it. They wanted more revenue and taxes to increase on people earning over 250,000, not 450,000. It was his way of signaling democrats who voted overwhelmingly for this. I played this tough, I have not been a softy on this. When you look at the results, you can't say that what the president said that night her things. I think there is one thing the president lost on that I think is significant and unfortunate. That is continuing the payroll tax holiday. I think the economy is not all the way back, it could use the boost of one more year. The payroll tax, low or middle income families could use that money for another year. That was an orphan idea the president proposed. No enthusiasm among republicans, but people on the liberal side and the left side said they do not want to take any more money away from social security. For me, that is the most significant here. You are giving on the income and losing some of that revenue. Yeah, that is significant, but a lot of democrats from affluent states and affluent districts actually wanted that number to go up a little bit. There are quite a few democrats who represent more affluent areas.

>> Thank you so much. We are waiting for the president speaking at 11:20. Mike vick para at the white house, we have about 30 seconds here, talk about that john maynor/paul ryan vote for it and then the erick cantor no. 
>> A lot of people will be reading into that. 
>> For the future of leadership, causing mischief, they speculated that john bayno wanted to put this boat off until after the new congress. On thursday, he simply played it safe. They knew this was going to be a very tough thing for him to put on the floor. The fact that he has done that and voted in support of it and now has eric cantor, his number two, the top deputy as the majority leader in the house of representatives voting against it, that is a fairly extraordinary development. Paul ryan very influential, people have been watching him to see how he was going to be voting on this. He voted in support of it. I want to reemphasize something, extraordinary, democrats, 172 against their leadership and behind president as well. 
>> We continue to watch. The vote coming out, the bill has passed out of the house. We go to capitol hill to get response. Table. The unfinished business is the question on suspending the rules and passing senate 2318 which the clerk will report by title. 

[00:15:08]


The clerk: Senate 2318, an to act rise the secretary of state to pay an award to combat 
>>> we have a deal. 15 minutes ago the gavel came down in the house passing concurring with the senate bill that was passed at 2:00 a.M. . 24 hours into the new year, and we go to the president. Reaction coming out, look russert is getting s[me response now on that development. 
>> I actually just ran into them. The speaker's office says, speaker banner felt that this was a very important vote and the best deal that the republicans could get. He very much wanted to solidify the tax issue, get it in place permanently. That is why he voted yes. But as we were talking about before, you don't see these divisions within the house gop leadership. They are pretty much all together. Sometimes you saw when nancy pelosi was speaker, she would vote against a war funding bill and the division we have seen them historic plea. A lot of people were looking at paul ryan, marco rubio voted no. Grand paul voted no. Paul ryan, a yes. What message does that send? That gave cover for republicans to come on board. John boehner, he got a lot of criticism today. He did not have to vote, stood up and voted. He showed his conference what he thought. It was pseudo courageous. 
>> Even though he did not have to vote, as you have underlined for us so far. We have some response there from a representative from speaker boehner's office. On your side, what do we expect the president to say when he comes to the microphone and about three minutes? 
>> I think he will laud the bipartisan nature and look ahead to what we have been talking about over the last half hour, what is coming in two-month's time. Let's take a look at what has happened since the election. I believe it was the day after the election, richard, when john boehner appeared in the capital and conceded that revenues were going to be raised. He wanted to close loopholes, and some deductions, but did not want to raise rates. He knew what was coming. The president had campaigned on that $250,000 threshold, over which people would have their taxes raged -- race. The speaker tried to get out ahead of that. The president stayed very firm -- I'm sorry, I think we are getting a two-minute warning. The president stayed very firm. The speaker's figure for raising revenue was $800 million over ten years. The final figure they ended up with in this package, $600 billion in new revenues. Very interesting, but there were supposed to be a 1 for 1 match on spending cuts to revenues. Spending cuts are minuscule. That is what caused all the turmoil today, all these twists and turns. House republicans did not want to come forward and vote for this without significant spending cuts. There were told they would live to fight another day when this new confrontation comes down the pipe around the beginning of march. 

[00:18:45]


>> Looking over his shoulder because at any moment, in about a minute president obama is about to speak. Luke, as we do wait for the president to come to the microphone, you said, wow, when we were telling you and releasing who voted yea and may. You have the boehner/client ray. And then you have to ask the question about leadership going forward and what this means. If you just look at the gop count, 86 yea for this, 151 day. Let us reflect when we do have the conference who will or will not vote for john boehner to keep his speakersh? 
>> I don't think there is any doubt that john boehner will be speaker. That will happen on thursday. There is a lot of confidence from folks that say there are not a love votes to overtake him. Some real conservative members can say they are upset with john boehner and that his election would happen on the first ballot. This does show us a divide amongst the gop leadership. The narrative all along, richard, and I was one who said this loudly, was that eric cantor had been in john boehner's side throughout this ordeal regarding the fiscal cliff. The last press conference john maynard did when plan b failed, eric cantor was right there saying we are in this together. Tonight, a little broken up. They went there different paths. That is something we should not read too much into. The same thing people said -- 
>> the president speaking right now. Let's stand by. 
>> Happy new year, everybody. The central premise of my campaign for president was to change the tax code that was too skewed toward the wealthy at the expense of working, middle-class americans. Tonight we have done that. Thanks to the votes of democrats and republicans in congress, i will sign a law that raises taxes on the wealthiest 2% of americans while preventing a tax hike that could have sent the economy back into recession and obviously had a severe impact on families across america. I want to thank all the leaders of the house and senate, in particular I want to think the work that was done by my extraordinary vice president, joe biden, as well as leader harry reid, speaker mannered and nancy pelosi and mitch McCONNELL. Everybody worked very hard on this. I want to thank you for your great work, joe. Under this law, more than 90% of americans and 97% of small businesses will not see their income taxes go up. Millions of families will continue to receive tax credits to help raise their kids and send them to college. Companies will continue to receive tax credits for the research that they do, investments they make, and a clean energy jobs they create. 2 million americans who are out of work cut out there looking, pounding the pavement every day, will continue to receive unemployment benefits as long as they are actively looking for a job. But I think we all recognize this lot is just one step in the broader effort to strengthen our economy and brought an opportunity for everybody. The fact is, the deficit is still too high. And we are still investing too ttle in the things that we need for the economy to grow as fast as it should. That's why speaker boehner and i tried to negotiate a larger agreement that would put this country on a path to paying down its debt and also putting americans back to work, rebuilding roads and bridges and providing investments in areas like educati and job-training. Unfortunately, that just wasn't enough support or time for that kind of large agreement in a lame-duck session of congress. That failure comes with a cost. The messy nature of the process ov the past several weeks has made business more uncertain and consumers less confident. But we are continuing to chip away at this problem step-by-step. Last year I signed into law $1.7 trillion in deficit reduction. Tonight could the agreement further reduces the deficit by raising $620 billion in revenue from the wealthiest households in america, and there will be more deficit reduction as congress decides what to do about the automatic spending cuts that we have now delayed for two months. I want to make this point. As I have demonstrated throughout the past several weeks, I am very open to compromise. I agree with democrats and republicans that the aging population and the rising cost of health care makes medicare the biggest contributor to our deficit. I believe we have to find ways to reform that program without hurting seniors who count on it to survive. I believe there is further unnecessary spending in government that we can eliminate. But, we can't simply cut our way to prosperity. Cutting spending has to go hand in hand with for the reforms to our tax code so that the wealthiest corporations and individuals can't take advantage of loopholes and deductions that are available to most americans. And we can't keep cutting things like basic research and new technology and still expect to succeed in the 21st century economy. We are going to have to to continue to move forward with deficit reduction, but we have to make sure that we are growing even as we get a handle on our spending. Now, when that last point I want to make. While I will negotiate over many things, I will not have another debate with this congress over whether or not they should pay the bills that they have already racked up through the laws that they have passed. Let me repeat. We can't not pay bills that we have already incurred. If congress refuses to fail to give us the ability to pay these bills on time, the consequences for the global economy would be catastrophic. Far worse than the impact of a fiscal cliff. People will remember back in 2011 the last time this course of action was threatened, our entire recovery was put at risk. Consumer confidence plunged, this meant business investment plunge, quote growth dropped. We can't go down that path again. This will remain in place as long as I am president. The deficit needs to be reduced in a way that is balanced. Everyone pays their fair share. Everyone does their part. That is how our economy works best. That's how we grow. The sum total of all budget agreements w have reached so far proves that there is a path forward, that it is possible. If we focus not on our politics but on what is right r the country. The one thing that I think we will focus on in the new year is seeing if we can put a package like this together with a little less drama, and the less brinksmanship, not scare the heck out of folks quite as much. We can come together as democrats and republicans to cut spending and raise revenue the way that reduces our deficit, protect the middle class, provides ladders into the middle class for everybody willing to work hard. We can find a way to afford the investment to grow and compete. We can settle this deba or at the very least not allowed it to be so all consuming all the time that it stops us from meeting a host of other challenges that we face, creating jobs, boosting incomes, fixing the infrastructure, fixing the immigration system, protecting our planet from climate change, boosting domestic energy production, protecting our kids from the horrors of gun violence. It is not just possible to do these things but an obligation to ourselves and future generations. I look forward to working with every single member of congress to meet this obligation in the new year. I hope that everybody now gets at least a day off, I guess, a few days off so that people can refresh themselves, because we have a lot of work to do in 2013. Thanks, everybody. Happy new year. 

[00:27:42]


>> There you have it, seven minutes speaking. President obama the very at business tone there remarking that the bill that was just passed on the house floor maintains tax cuts for 90% of americans. He also said one step of many. Although he had hoped for a grand bargain in all of this that it was not possible in the end. When he looks at the deficit, he still wants to focus on that when it comes to making sure and ensuring that the way the government pays its bills, that is something that he will not compromise on. He also said this is the first time in 20 years that congress has acted in a bipartisan way. Mike was right there listening to the president. His tone was straight on. We just got this done. 
>> You are absolutely right. It culminates a long effort by the president and something he had campaigned on. You saw the president in one of his purposes to pre-empt the coming fight that is just two months away now. You heard him talk about it and laid down that marker yet again on the debt ceiling. He said he is not going to play that game. He said it again tonight, the good faith and credit of the united states is not going to be put at risk, he said. He raised a point that has been raised many times, congress cannot take away the ability to pay the bills that congress has incurred. He laid down that marker. The question remains, congress has to vote to raise that debt ceiling. That is simply the fact. The debt ceiling has been hit YESTERDAY ON DECEMBER 31st. Because the treasury secretary is able to move around some sickout and by about two more months, the sequestration cuts that the president spoke about will be delayed another two months as well as spending bills that keep running. The president is trying to get out in front there and talk about the need for cooperation, talk about the president -- president of bipartisanship that has been set with what has happened here. He talked about the fact that he still wants a grand bargain and the fact that medicare is something that will have to be addressed. Those are difficult challenges that have to be faced. To a certain extent, he was getting out ahead of some of the frustration and disaffection that he will feel from his left, from the base of his party when those issues are tackled. The president had a number of things on the agenda that he wanted to address and punctuate this long fight that has just come to an end tonight on new year's day. I don't even know what time it is as we approach mid that. 

[00:30:32]


>> Almost pass new year's day. We are just learning that the president will be heading to hawaii shortly and will be rejoining his family. 
>> As we had suspected. 
>> He left early so he could be part of this deal that was brokered. We sabas joe biden there. Look russert, who is here with us, joe biden really coming in in the last hour and really getting this done, you saw him smiling over the shoulder of president obama and probably thinking we did get this done and I came in at the last moment. As we look forward to these other clips that we have been talking about, will we see more of vice president joe biden in the mix to try to put together some deals? 
>> One would think. I spoke to gop aides who are very much involved in the fiscal quick ordeal. They told me almost to a person, we really wish joe biden had gotten involved a month ago after the election because he is better to negotiate with then the president and the president's team directly. Part of that is a knock on the president of the united states, but it could be joe biden's relationship with people in congress and that he understands how the sausage is made. It's not pretty and it takes barbering back and forth connecting on a personal level. To go back to what the president said, which I found interesting, he took time to mention energy reform, gun violence and immigration. Those are important to him. Those I can tell you will not move anywhere in the house of representatives until the debt limit is fixed, and president says he will not negotiate over the debt limit. I can tell you from pretty good sources that house republicans will not extend the debt limit unless it fits a manner roll, matching spending cuts. Could there be some sort of negotiations moving forward that this would be figured out? Certainly. The idea that he will not negotiate will not sit well with house republicans, and they are more than happy to try to bring this fight to him, very AGGRESSIVELY, COME MARCH 1st. This fight will be the one that grabs all the media attention that takes that political capital, which is so important in the beginning of a second term. President obama has 11 months to get things done before people move on to the 2014 midterms. Immigration, energy, new gun-control, a lot of that will be washed up by this debt limit fight and by 5 over continuing to fund the government. Those things sound nice, but i will tell the audience these next few weeks, months on capitol hill will be about the budget and about a new cliff, a new cliff if you will. This is the debt limit cliff, the sequestration cliff. All those big issues will probably be on the back burner. 

[00:33:39]


>> Luke, mike joining us. Ezra, we got the numbers, the president just spoke. Luke was just saying, the president coming out and laying out his plan, looking at the future fights, if you will. He did mention energy, gun-control amongst all these other issues that we have debated just within the last week or so when it comes to fiscal issues and for the government. Put this into context for us. 
>> It's all about the debt ceiling now. We will hear recommendations on gun controln january. I have high doubt that anything big will happen on energy before we get to the debt ceiling. The fiscal cliff had the possibility to push the economy into recession. Probability and stayed over it. Reaching the debt ceiling would push the global economy, not just into recession but into a genuine crisis. We are talking depression that has a lingering consequences for the american economy because we will not be able to borrow at anywhere near the low rates we do now if we go over the debt ceiling. This will be a really dangerous negotiation and dangerous for the reasons we have set. You have two cents making an argument that cannot both be true. Republicans say they will force a debt ceiling negotiation and they are going to get spending cuts. It will be one to one for every dollar increase with big spending cuts and no board tax cuts. We are only going to negotiate over tax reform and spending cut packages. Either one side is right in the other is wrong or they are both wrong and we will reach the debt ceiling. Three possibilities on the table, one very, very dangerous for the economy. They can't all be right, only one can be right. 

[00:35:40]


>> When you look at this, talking about the debt ceiling, and we pushed into the first couple of months of the new year, should we expect another confrontation as we have experienced here during new year's? 
>> There is no evidence that congress, the american political system at this period in time can do anything in advance. They are always cramming. They are always going over cliffss. It is an embarrassing way to run a government. Again, I want to be very clear that the debt ceiling is a much more dangerous negotiation. What I would love to tell you is that there is nobody in the government crazy enough to do this again, but there are people who will bring it to the edge. One thing I think we need to say, and it's important to take from these negotiations that helps republicans had a reputation for being completely unreasonable. They don't negotiate, come to deals. In the end speaker boehner brought this bill to the floor knowing it would pass. His members supported him, many did vote for it. Some of the key fiscal leaders did vote for it. Republicans are irrational. They had a vision of what is in their political best interest. We may get to the debt ceiling and a look at what the president is doing. We are better getting, just having a deal with spending cuts and revenue generating tax reform. A lot don't even mind tax reform. And they might be blamed for it by the business community and the public. 
>> What about political calculus? Speaker boehner vote yes, cantor voted no, paul ryan voted yes on this as well. 85 yeas. What is your reflection? 
>> I think that there was a vote that was somewhat misleading in its tolls tonight, which is to say there are a lot of republicans that voted no. Speaker been brought this to the floor in knowing that he would survive bringing it to the floor. They allow this to come to a vote knowing it would pass and essentially become law afterward. When you were speaker of the house, one of the key powers to have is the power to control the floor. Speaker boehner used that tonight in a way that he and his members understood would lead to probably the passage of this bill. While it's true that republicans chose to vote no on the bill specifically, the republican party and house republicans permitted the bill to pass. There were political calculations, but in breaking and permitting the bill to come to the floor without the support of more than half the republican congress, speaker banner and his congress, they said, they said that we see in our political self-interest to resolve this negotiation and allow this bill to pass even if a lot of us will vote for it. It was an attempt to have it both ways. In a broadway people understand the republican fingerprints all over this. 

[00:38:58]


>> Quickly to you before we move on, how will this be remembered a year from now? 
>> Poorly. This has been another embarrassing set piece from an embarrassing congress. 
>> It will be positive. 
>> No, it will not be. 
>> Thank you for joining us tonight. We appreciate it. To you here, mike, what will be the perspective on what we have experienced today? Will it be forgotten based on the fact we have these big cliffs in front of us? 
>> I think there is a lot of scar tissue built up around some of these fiscal fights. I agree wholeheartedly with ezra. It will depend on how this next conference -- confrontation is resolved. The debt ceiling is the debt ceiling, once you have gone beyond that there is no turning back. That is a very hard deadline, whereas the fiscal cliff, while it would be horrible by most accounts for folks's taxes to go up, some $2,200 on average for the average american family, that is something that can be handled retroactively. People would have tried to absorb it the best they could. Richard, as I'm talking to you now, you can hear the rovers of the helicopter, marine one as it lands on the south lawn here to pick up the president and take him back to air force one and to rejoin his family after his abbreviated stay in hawaii with these negotiations not bearing fruit the first time over the christmas holiday. He is expected to be out there for about another week. Certainly the president wants to come to the briefing room and punctuate the negotiation, large and successful negotiation that he has had with strong support from democrats. 176 democrats in the house of representatives voting for this measure, 12 of voting against. That is an extraordinary total considering what we have heard from the left leading up to this vote about their frustration with the president, and their words, caving on that income level. Altogether, an extraordinary series of events, a lot of turmoil. For a while there, it did not appear as if congress was going to be able to get it done. They got it done, it certainly wasn't pretty, but we are not going over that fiscal quick. 

[00:41:31]


>> JANUARY 1st, WE GOT IT DONE 23 hours into the day. Mike, luke, stand by. We are definitely going to have more on this. Again, we are getting reaction to the bill on the house floor that passed in concurrence with the senate bill and to go to the white house. They have a deal. This about 40 minutes ago. 257-167. Many congressmembers' excited, some are definitely not. We will have more coverage of this fiscal cliff negotiation and now the agreement here on a mess in d.C. We will be right back.

>>> Breaking news this hour, 11:46 eastern time, about 45 minutes ago a deal was passed in the house and will be sent to the president. We are getting reaction. We got this from speaker boehner's office. He voted for in this concurrence, this bill that went to the house floor. He brought it to the floor for the up or down vote. He says that the federal government has a spending problem that has led to a $16 trillion national debt that threatens the country to the future. On the day after the election, i propose that both parties work together to avert the fiscal cliff in a manner that would insure 2013 is the year that we enact entitlement reform and pro-growth tax reform to begin to solve the country's debt problem. Luc russert, who has been on capitol hill in the halls there, he has seen speaker boehner go by you many times today. You have reflected very clearly about the surprising things that have happened today, one of which is how the speaker voted for this. When we were having the separation between eric cantor, the number two republican from the house and speaker dinner not saying anything early. What reactions to you here at the moment? 
>> It's interesting, richard. It's not a bill where you have a typical victory lap because neither is tied is particularly satisfied. They are more elated with the bill then are republicans. The president was very happy that taxes will go up for the majority of americans. As I have said, republicans are giving the message of look, we will live to fight another day and fight on the debt mit. BY MARCH 1st. Democrats are happy to get this done and able to avoid the calamity that would come to the fiscal cliff. Before you went to break, you ask what we would remember from a year from now. It's important to say that the 112th congress is all over. This congress will go down in history in terms of stats as the worst congress in terms of passing legislation. The folks in the house and speaker boehner and all to the rank and file, their mission when they were elected in 20 and president obama's first midterm election was that they wanted to be appliqued on president obama's legislation. If you look at what they were able to do in the last two years, they were pretty much able to curtail any of the big things that president obama wanted to do. While we look back at that and say this was a very -- the least productive congress, they did exactly what they said they were going to do in 2012 -- 2010. They wanted to cut spending, cut spending, that will be the message moving forward.

>>> congress finally got a deal done. That happened 52 minutes ago. Ththe gavel came down. About 30 minutes ago president obama came to the microphone at the white house before he embarks to hawaii and made his remarks. This is what he said. 
>> Happy new year, everybody. A central premise of my campaign for president was to change the tax code that was too skewed toward the wealthy at the expense of working, middle-class americans.

=======================================================

We're following what is happening on the house floor. House minority leader nancy pelosi speaking, let's listen in. 
>> We talked much about what would happen, all the gloom and doom of what would happen if we went over the cliff. Well, let's talk instead about what happens if we don't go over the cliff. And I believe that we will not, seeing the -- the vote on the rulehis evening. I believe that we will heed the american people come together, with a strong vote. We will increase by voting for this legislation and passing it in a strong bipartisan way. We'll increase the confidence of consumers, of the markets. Of businesses, of employers to hire more. We will extend unemployment insurance to people who have lost their jobs through no fault of their own. This is very, very important. Not only to those individuals, but to our economy because this is money that is spent immediately, injecting demand into the economy creating jobs. We'll extend permanent tax relief for the middle class, for more than 98% of american taxpayers, more than 97% of american's small businesses. We will support our middle class, strengthen it by supporting child tax credits, credits for higher education, american opportunity credits. Earned income tax credit and the like, our distinguished ranking member went through some of the provisions. But it is important to see them in the light of what they mean to america's working families. By doing this, by voting for the agreement we will demonstrate that we listened to the american people. We have heeded their call, once again, to work together in a bipartisan way. I want to salute president obama. He campaigned on strengthening the middle class. I think all of us probably did. And this is one way for us to fulfill that promise. Yes, to all of those who say this does -- all the other things that don't happen in the bill. No, I don't know any piece of legislation that I have ever voted for that did everything that I thought it should do. But this is a very, very strong step -- first step as we go into the new year. Let us send a message to the american people that again, while this bill doesn't accomplish all that we need to do, to grow the economy, reduce the deficit and strengthen the middle class, it is a good way for us to have a happy start to a new year. By taking this first step. I hope that as again, you balance the equities, the pros and cons of this legislation that you will weigh heavily in favor of the message that it sends to the kitchen tables of america. About the respect we have for them, meeting their needs, meeting their challenges, honoring their aspirations. This great middle class is the back bone of our democracy, let's support our democracy, vote aye on this strong bipartisan legislation which passed 89-8 in the united states senate. Let's step up to the plate to do that in the house of representatives. I urge my colleagues to vote aye and yield back the balance of my time. 

[00:03:31]


>> Leader nancy pelosi there, like so many democrats, wanting this bill to come to the floor of the house for a vote. An up and down vote. She will get that in just about an hour or so. As part of that, although was asked throughout the day as to how many democrats she could bring in her caucus, as so well known, leader nancy pelosi able to whip her caucus, know exactly who will be voting yae or nay, the number has been floated around. A lot happening now, the final bill to avoid the fiscal cliff is being debated as we were just listening to on the floor of the house of representatives. Voting starts as soon as debate concludes, and we estimate that to be within about an hour or so. Months of estimates and gamesmanship come down to this. This is msnbc's coverage of the fiscal cliff showdown in washington. We are staying with you until we do get a final vote in the house, we'll watch that picture right there. House speaker john boehner was able to silence a revolt in his over party, that happened earlier and will bring a bill to the vote. Which will happen shortly. The senate bill passed early this morning and extends the bush tax cuts for 98% of american households. A large number of house republicans said they would not support the bill without adding spending cuts. However, they did not have the votes needed to advance an amended bill. Joining us now from the capitol is john stanton, washington bureau chief, okay, john, do we have a deal when this comes to the floor for a vote in about an hour or so? 
>> Yeah, it looks like they have the final votes for it. It should be about 217-218, which is a minimum number of votes, essentially 250 or 60, depending on how many come along with speaker boehner and part of his leadership team. And it looks likes nancy pelosi will be able to deliver, did a fairly good job of selling this to progressives in particular, who had a lot of complaints about provisions in the bill. So it looks like they will have a pretty strong showing. 

[00:05:50]


>> You know, john, the conservative analyst charles krauthammer said it is a complete route for democrats and "a complete surrender" for the gop. How is this seen? 
>> I think a lot of people see it very much that way. Democrats certainly see themselves as having to give up a lot of things, particularly on the marginal tax rates. They feel like you know, there should have been some other spending provisions in it. Republicans see it differently. They say well, we have unemployment insurance not paid for. We are raising taxes on the wealthy. And so both sides, I think there is a lot of grousing, which generally seen around here is a good sign. I'm not sure if that is the case, but at least for the time being that will get it passed for the next few days, at least. 
>> For those joining us right now, saying I thought we had a deal at 2:00 in the morning, now what are we talking about right now? 
>> Well, basically the same bill they voted on last night at 2:00 in the senate. Because after democrats took a look at it and republicans, basically at john boehner's conference said no, they were not going to take this bill. They didn't like it. And there was chaos, but john boehner let them go away, and let the defeat sort of sink in with his conference. They understood there was no way at this point it would change. They were just going to have to take this deal, and the spending fights, save for another day. 
>> How about knowing this is the process? You need to allow the conservative members of the gop caucus to vent what their views are. They would not support this bill. They didn't support plan b where the threshold was at a million. This was just speaker boehner allowing them to, if you will, get on the record somehow by opposing this senate bill. And then in the end allowing this to get to the floor. 

[00:07:51]


>> I think there was a certain amount of that, but he was trying very hard to do this. You know, he had the plan b, sort of failure really hurt his contribute with the conference. He has seen his leadership very much weakened as a result of this. So a part of it was a decision on his part to let it play out a little bit and try to let it work out with themselves. Some of this conference was sort of runnjng the show to a certain degree. So you know, I wouldn't say it was just that. 
>> All right, thank you so much for stopping by today. Again, john stanton, washington bureau chief for us from buzz feed. Thank you so much. We'll go right back to the floor to listen to the debate. 
>> Those veteran's hospitals, a million, at least, new veterans, 45,000 wounded. Do you know what the republican whip said during those crucial years? Cutting taxes in a time of war is patriotic. So much for sacrifice for all of us. When you look back into how we got to this problem, revenue at 50% of gdp, that is an eisenhower figure headed towards truman. We have argued in this town about 19-21% for the better part of 30 years. 50% of revenue at gdp. 12 years of tax cuts. Now this represents a reasonable step forward tonight. And I want to say with some personal satisfaction, I'm delighted with what we have finally done to put to rest alternative minimum tax. A million families in massachusetts were threatened with alternative minimum tax. It was the responsible position tonight, but I want to give you a number. You know what these patches have cost us? 2.2 trillion. Over the life of amt. The theology that we heard that was so popular in this institution, tax cuts pay for themselves. You can't find a main stream economist today in america that will acknowledge that problem. This is a reasonable step forward, vote for this measure and let's get on to fundamental tax reform. 

[00:10:09]


>> Gentleman's time has expired. Gentleman from michigan, mr. Camp. 
>> I reserve. 
>> Gentleman reserves, gentleman from michigan, mr. Levin. 
>> -- Representative richard neal, speaking live on the house floor as we wait for the up or down vote, the bill passed in the senate today, so many hours later we do expect that vote to happen. We're watching them debate that on the floor. Joining us now's one of those who will be voting very shortly, congressman peter welch. Thank you for joining us. >>. 
>> What is your understanding of how the bill will pass? 
>> It is going to pass, the republicans had a lot of consternation, they don't want the raise taxes, grover norquist was thrown to the floor in the senate and is about to be thrown to the floor in the house. There is a lot of things they don't like, bottom line we all know we need revenues as part of the fiscal solution to reduce the debt. And secondly, it is really important for the country to do things together. You know, a divided congress is one thing, but a compromising congress is another. So we need to see that. The fights that we have that are very serious, they're going to continue. Make no mistake about it. But bottom line, this is going to put a significant marker down that grover norquist is gone. 
>> Looking forward to more compromises as you are alluding to, we have several more compromises coming up in the quarter. Do you expect this compromise? Do you expect bills to be brought to the floor as we are seeing today without following the majority, the majority rule? 
>> No, I don't. There is a very contentious atmosphere here in congress. And frankly it reflects the fact that there are two polar different positions on how we should address our debt. And I think this is a reflection today that this will pass, of what president obama had on the campaign. People supported his position, he ran on raising taxes on the top 2%. The romney supporters actually agreed with president obama on that position, the polls show. They know that that is part of it. The hard work going forward is that we're going to have to deal with the cost of health care. This is not a medicare issue so much as it is an american problem where our health care costs go up 2 and 3 times the rate of inflation. And that is not sustainable. But the other issue here is that this is going to I think, help stabilize the economy. We're seeing glimmers of positives in the economy, by boosting revenues and helping us alleviate our deficit. 

[00:13:07]


>> We talk about big business, fortune 500, wall street, bringing up the 2 trillion in cash that they have sitting on the shelves. Businesses waiting to spend that. And the lack of spending, optimism causing concern, perhaps dragging on the economy as we see the glimmers you're talking about. For instance in the housing market, and some tick back in the unemployment rate. We'll get that number back on friday, too. But that is expected to go up. Speaker boehner's role here, talk about that. He said to the senate, basically if you can come up with a bipartisan bill I will bring it to the floor. Did he have any other choice other than to do that today? Although we hear rumors that that may not be the case. 
>> Well, I'm a speaker john boehner fan, he understands the reduction on the debt. He understands that president obama won the election and is willing to acknowledge that that means that the american people support revenues as being part of of the solution. His challenge, he has a caucus of members who ran in districts where they promised lower taxes and they won. So what does speaker boehner do? He has a caucus that wants to lower taxes. There are people who voted for them, supported that. But he knows the country needs higher revenues. And he is, in fact, following through and putting on the floor the bill for an up or down vote that is going to move us forward. So you know, kudos to speaker boehner. 
>> What do you think in the last 24 hours you have learned about speaker boehner? 
>> He has got a hard job, he has a hard job. 
>> Certainly. 
>> He does. 
>> And you don't want it, i guess if you had that opportunity. 
>> Well, it is not an opportunity. 
>> Not for you, not yet. 
>> He has got a tough job. And you know what? My sense of the speaker is that he wants to try to do the best for the country. This is not the deal he wants but he knows that it is i suppose the best deal he can get. It is not the deal I want, frankly I would advocate for significantly more revenues because I think that ultimately will be essential if we're going to balance or budget. But bottom line, if he is willing to put this on the floor and give us an opportunity to vote yes or no then I give him the credit for do that. 

[00:15:20]


>> Yeah, if you got the job you may start to cry, too, is what you're saying, congressman peter welch, thank you. 
>> Thank you. 
>> Stay with us, we'll have more on the vote on the house floor. When that happens we'll have THAT FOR YOU, TOO. [ Male Announcer ] THE Rhythm of life.

[00:18:50]


>>> again watching breaking news coming out of the capital, capitol hill on the debate floor. Started about 30 minutes ago. They are debating the senate bill and will have a vote on that very shortly. Watching that with us has been our nbc correspondent, luke russert, we have been watching this, you have the cameras where you see it in the halls. You have been chasing the lawmakers throughout the day. Tell us about the arc of the mood, the arc of the frustration or of the energy of members today and where they're at right now as they get into debate. 
>> Well, it is fascinating, richard, as you know, the senate passed this bipartisan vote with 89 votes about 2:00 this morning, speaking to the members ON BOTH SIDES, mitch McConnell, we're going to move forward with parts of this bill, at least we'll move forward, we may not like it. Joe biden came, democrats were on board. And all that was left was john boehner to sell the plan to republicans. Then, we get word that eric cantor had some problems with the bill. That a lot of house republicans had problems with the bill. And then we sort of see the collapse of the bill among the HOUSE GOPs. Talk that it may be amended, that it could go down and send the markets into a tail spin. What is interesting, richard, when it happened there were a lot of republicans that we spoke to, they said it is lunacy. We can't do this. We'll take the blame for the party -- left, right, democrat, republican, we need to take this deal. There is another part of the house republican in congress, that said no, no, no, let's have a fight on this. This comes back to, republicans know that they got $40<,000 as a threshold. A lot of them take it as a victory, because the president started at 250. They think take this deal, then the real fight will come in march on the debt limit. And if they don't budge, you know that is the real, real big one when it comes to how the markets will react if they want to fight to the debt limit, that will be the next big one. That is when we'll surely pay more attention to than we did this. 

[00:21:16]


>> The credits could be down graded, only the second time in our history in modern times. Talk to us about what is happening on the floor right now, since you and I talked an hour ago, what happened between them is they began the debate on the floor. From what you watched and heard, looks pretty good. Anything stand out to you at all? 
>> There was one funny moment where the representative, lewis gomer, a republican from texas, he said I have not a lot to say. I just want to say it is quite fascinating that now, many, many democrats realize that the bush tax cuts were good for 98% of americans and for the middle class. Sort of ribbing a lot of democrats who are very, very opposed to tax limits throughout the threshold, all throughout the years. You are seeing the partisan zingers, if you will. And mainly, partisan voting on both sides. The american politics in the last ten years, republicans have not seen taxes go up at all, not since bush said read my lips, no new taxes. A lot of americans, when you're IN YOUR 20s, 30s, 40s, NEVER SAW Your taxes go up. And some will see that with the pal tax cut expiring. With rates going higher for many of the wealthy. And so some credits will be gone. So it is a real big development in the sense that all -- almost 20 years of republican party orthodoxy, the no new taxes by any means, going away tonight. And the optics, well, we're going over the cliff, taxes going up on everybody. This is about to affect everybody. Either way it is very, very big news on capitol hill. 
>> All right, nbc news correspondent luke russert, thank you. 
>> Thank you, take care. 
>> I know it is a day of football for you, but instead you're watching. 

[00:23:18]


>> I know congress got their act together quicker than the nhl, and the lockout, we want the classic back on nbc. 
>> There you go, luke russert, stay with us. We'll bring you more live coverage, we're watching that for you. We'll be right back. Testo hard on these issues for decades. Mr. Hoy . 

[00:26:40]


>>> Well, off to the floor of the house debate, it continues in about 30 minutes, roughly in that time frame we could know whether there is a deal to avert the so-called fiscal cliff. They're debating it right now. That will end in about 15 minutes, and then we expect a vote to begin on the senate floor, that bipartisan effort, with broad support, at 2:00 this morning. Joining us now by phone is ezra klein of "the washington post," and nbc political analyst. Ezra, you are probably watching this. And for many of us watching it, if you will, did you think it was going to come down to the income thresholds? I was reading your latest post. And it was the first item listed on the major parts of this deal. 
>> Yeah, in some ways I think the income threshold has long been one of the big sticking points, right? And early in this process, president obama was very, very aggressive in arguing the point that he was not allowed taxes -- hopes that tax rates, for people making $250,000 or above, him going up to $450,000 is a genuine significant concession, particularly given the default here with higher taxes. But I give both sides of the negotiators both credit and blame for that. This comes down to just a dozen or two dozen different things to estate taxes, whether or not we off set the sequester. The number moving parts of the detail in this deal were really significant. And it is probably why we were not able to get a bigger deal. They had trouble adjusting the parts in the bigger areas where there is probably a fair amount of existing agreement. 
>> You also said you thought republicans were winning for this deal. For those who are not the far right of the caucus, those who are the moderate republicans they believe they are winning in this deal, too. What are they getting out of this? Not only the 400 and the 450. 

[00:28:43]


>> Let me just say, where the republicans are I think it is too early to tell who is winning. But what republicans think they have here, is they believe from the beginning, at least the realists, after president obama won on the election they thought they would lose, given that taxes were going up one way or the other they were going to have to compromise on that. Or they would get killed in the court of public opinion. They voted president obama down on that. Getting away with fewer taxes than they thought. And it is really too early to tell who is winning here. What they believe is going to happen, on the debt ceiling republicans are going to say we're not going to raise the debt ceiling unless you give us a very significant amount, dollar for dollar spending cuts. And this time they want the spending cuts in medicare, in social security, and medicaid. They think the debt ceiling is where they have all the leverage. So they were able to take the points of the agreement, which was the fiscal cliff and the taxes, where it would go up automatically, get up with the smaller tax increase than expected. Now we sort of move to the republican portion of the leverage agreement. Republicans say there is no way they would be held hostage. If republicans want further spending cuts they will have to match it with tax increases. Which side is right on that, ultimately it is going to be decided who got the better end of this deal. 
>> Ezra klein, thank you as always, happy new year to you. 
>> All right, we'll be right back. from Is bigger than we think ... like the flu. With aches, fever and chills- the flu's a really big deal. So why treat it like it's a little cold? There's something that works differently than over-the-counter remedies. Prescription TAMIFLU attacks the flu virus at its source. So don't wait. Call your doctor right away. TAMIFLU is prescription medicine for treating the flu in adults and children one year and older whose flu symptoms started within the last two days. Before taking TAMIFLU tell your doctor if you're pregnant, nursing. have serious health conditions, or take other medicines. If you develop an allergic reaction, a severe rash, or signs of unusual behavior, stop taking TAMIFLU and call your doctor immediately. Children and adolescents in particular may be at an increased risk of seizures, confusion or abnormal behavior. The most common side effects are mild to moderate nausea and vomiting. The flu comes on fast, so ask your doctor about TAMIFLU. Prescription for flu. ] ?????? ?????? many hot dogs are within you.

[00:33:23]


>>> It is a beautiful january first, 2013, as you look at a live picture of the capital, rotunda, very gorgeous shot here on this tuesday. Quiet outside, but then you go inside. On the floor is where they are, about 45 minutes into the debate, on the senate bill passed at 2:00. Seems so long ago, one of the folks that joins us is congressman john yarmuth, democrat from kentucky. Congressman, you and I have been talking throughout this entire process. 
>> Yes. 
>> And I want to start with this. So just give us some context, if we go back about 520 days, that is when the fiscal cliff was born. And at that time some say that was really the best deal that democrats could have gotten out of this new congress, the wave congress of tea party members. 
>> Well, I -- you know, I vote d against the budget control act back in august of 2011. The act was really precipitated over the last rising of the debt ceiling. I figured we would end up here, that so many of the differences that we have about raising taxes on the very wealthiest americans, are really intractable differences, and basically it took the last moment, the house republicans are driving the car, careening towards the cliff. And ultimately they decided that it would be best not to go off. We haven't by any stretch, resolved, I think the very -- pronounced differences that we have about how to resolve our fiscal situation in this country. And what to invest in, and where to get the revenue we need to run the government and to provide the kind of incentives we need for economic growth. So this is a fight that is going to continue to go on. I mean, what we're going to see in a few minutes is a small percentage of house republicans, I guess most of them are probably lame ducks, voting to keep us from going off the cliff. 

[00:35:30]


>> How many do you expect? 
>> I think this estimate now is somewhere between 50 and 70 republicans joining the -- a broad majority of democrats to get this bill passed. But that gives you an indication of where we're going to be for the next couple of months. I mean, these fights will continue, but I think you also see kind of the pattern for success going forward. And that is that there are republicans, even though it is a minority of the republicans in the house, who do understand that there is a -- a perspective that is much broader and more important than the narrow ideology that has motivated so many of them. I hope that going forward we look at this day and say we can do this on a regular basis. We don't have to have a majority of a majority. Democrats are willing to work with republicans who want to move the country forward. 
>> We'll see if that -- that process that is being established today continues or it is just a blip on the screen or on the curve at the moment. So you are saying 50 to 70, so congressman on your side in your caucus, would therefore need about 50 to 170 of the 193 democrats. Are you going to vote yes on it, and do you think that number is possible here? 
>> Well, I think it is possible. I'm very confident that we'll provide the votes that are necessary. I'm comfortable with the deal that was reached. And again, I think this was the kind of thing that the american people expect. They expect both sides of a debate, or -- divide to give and to compromise. And most of wha we were compromising here, were not really principles, they were policies and they were numbers. I mean to go from 250,000 to $450,000 versus a million, those were just dollars we were compromising. Those are things american people are confused about. Why can't you just split the difference or come to some middle ground? And we did it here, thanks to senator McConnell, who I rarely thank, and vp joe biden, and so his credit, spker boehner who said I'm going to pass on to boehner rule and I will put it on the floor, because this is best for the american people. Again, I think this is potentially a formula for ongoing progress for the congress and for the american people. 

[00:37:55]


>> So he has courage now, again? 
>> He was -- had courage today, I think he again has it now. 
>> And I allude to the conversation we had with john yarmuth, and then the deal where you said he was not courageous and thank you for taking us along the day, it has been quite a roller coaster. 
>> My pleasure. 
>> Stay with us, we have continuing coverage on the house, the effort to avoid the fiscal cliff. The debate continues, we expect a vote to happen any minute now in the next 20 minutes or so. We'll continue to watch this and get all the information coming out of the capital. Stay with us on "msnbc." We'll be right back. From a devastating tornado. 
Man: And now we're helping the east coast recover from hurricane sandy. We're a leading global insurance company, based right here in america. We've repaid every dollar america lent us. Everything,plus a profit of more than $22 billion. For the american people. Thank you, america. Helping people recover and rebuild -- that's what we do. Now let's bring on tomorrow. 

[00:41:47]


>>> Well, this is it, this is what we have been waiting for for so long, so many weeks, months, even a couple of years some may say, when the fiscal cliff was first designed, about 520 days ago. But this is the moment, what you are watching on the house floor, a vote to concur with the senate bill that was approved at 2:00 a.M., Expected to take about 15 to 20 minutes. We do expect that we'll have an up or down, we'll understand whether that senate bill will become law, goes to the president to be signed first, to become law. There is speaker boehner, walking in to vote. The question is whether he will or will not vote. He does not have to, but he can. We're watchihem come in, 44 nays, and of course, that number is 217. 217, a majority of three vacancies in the house, obviously it looks like they have a healthy majority. A couple of things to watch, in the house of representatives. How many republicans are voting for this? They're expecting 60 to 70 are needed to really ensure a victory. And because -- democrats, obviously as you can see right there, 53 to 4 are voting in support of this in an overwhelming fashion. Even though we are told, I don't expect that spread to stay that much. There were a lot of disaffected and frustrated, disappointed democrats, particularly on the left. The progressive side of things. 
>> So far if you look at this, vic, 33 in the republican column, yay, 43, nay, do you expect that to be consistent pretty much all the way through? 
>> That is interesting, probably asplit, better than people anticipated, the speaker will vote in support of this, john boehner, will vote in support of it. Obviously, for him to put it on the floor was a dicey proposition to begin with. Richard, we have been talking about this all weekend. A lot of people have made a lot of hay about the so-called majority of the majority rule. And the speaker was really digging in. He had told his conference, the gop membership in the house that he was not interested in putting a "democratic bill" on the floor. That is standard practice, that is not a recent development. It has been that way almost since the history of the republic. But richard, all the turmoil, all the questions, all of the cliff-hanger nature of this over the course of the afternoon when it appeared in the morning that house republicans were going to be in revolt, they were not going to accept the verdict from the senate in that deal that had been negotiated. And of course, from the frantic days of last weekend, mitch McCONNELL AND JOE BIDEN, AFTER Talks had collapsed between the democratic, harry reid, and -- what is it getting to be? 21 hours or so ago? 89, to 8, an extraordinary vote, with only five republicans and democrats in the senate voting against that. We thought that the bill -- really, just enormous margin, almost unheard of margin coming into the house. John boehner would be able to point at that, and say look, we'll be able to fight another day. The writing on the wall. Let's put it on the floor, in two month's time there will be opportunities for us to really push for the spending cuts that many of his rank and file thought were lacking in this bill. Obviously, they will still look for that. It didn't come easy, we had a lot of drama over the course of the day. Look at the vote spread now, 104 to 56, 69 to five, look at the democrats lining up in the leadership. That is fairly extraordinary. I'm looking down at the monitor here. Things appear to be on a glide path here for passage of this bill, making its way to the president's desk. 

[00:45:58]


>> Ten more votes, I think, vic as we watch it go down the column there. The yay, for republicans, who are there? 
>> Well, you have a lot of people loyaleadership. You have a lot of people loyal to leadership. Who are beholden to positions, as chairman to create an example. However, one thing very interesting is that eric cantor, part of what really triggered this is the number two, one of the conservative leaders in the country. Eric cantor, number two in the house under john boehner, had declared under closed doors, that it was a no. It remains to see how he is voting. I don't know any reason that he would have changed mind, other than asking the membership to vote inavor of it. After all, the majority controls the floor, the majority leader is putting this on the floor. That is the way the house of representatives works. Sort of a mixed bag, obviously in the nay column, you will have relatively new conservatives who came in the tea party wave and the conservative wave in the last two cycles, richard. 
>> Also, vic, joining us is allison schwartz, are congresswoman, as you look at the numbers I watched you earlier on the floor as the debate was going on for the rule, as well as later on the debate was going on for the senate vote itself. We're looking at the numbers right now on the screen. And if you look closely, 78, and 7, yay for the democrats, but we also see 42 yays so far, and the nays, are you surprised where the numbers are going for the republicans. 

[00:48:01]


>> Well, I don't want to second guess what we'll hear in a few minutes, but just hearing the comments, obviously you heard republicans speaking against this legislation. But you also heard a number of them, including the chairman of the ways and means committee speaking for it. And so common sense, pretty clearly we're strong on our side on this. There was some discussion, but the fact that looking at this legislation, I think I said it a few moments ago on the floor. It really does create predictability, and stability, and certainty for 99 -- well, for all americans. But 99% of american families and businesses will see a tax cut continue. And that is pretty important. We have been debating this, arguing it, having really quite a bit of difficulty, the bipartisan vote here, as well. But it is just so important to be able to get this done as we conclude this really rather difficult congress, demonstrate that we can govern and make difficult decisions, and they can be bipartisan. I think we stood our ground, that was important, the leadership from the white house, and the senate. But it was important for us today, too, to really stand firm and really call on the republicans to work with us. 
>> About six more minutes on the vote, we're watching the number, 217 underneath the yay column there, the 217, yay column, congresswoman, that means we do have a deal. It will go to the president. He will sign it perhaps as early as tomorrow. And we have a law at the moment. The democrats, leader nancy pelosi as she has traditionally done, being able to whip her caucus. The members getting in line it appears except for at the moment, eight of those. When you were on the floor, and I watched you, discussions that were happening, what is the mood on the floor about what is happening right now? What is about to start, which is the vote? 
>> Well, it is so interesting, many people asked what it felt like to come back to congress on sunday and to try and get this done. And tell you, at least to say on the democratic side, the republicans, as well. We wanted to be here and get it done. We understand how important it is for us to make these decisions about tax policies for our families, while we did increase rates for the very upper income, we did it in a fair way. And we stood firm on that. But again, 99% of americans are going to see all the tax -- you know, those tax cuts continue. And that is pretty important. And a lot of tax provisions for helping students go to college. I mean, we have fought for these things for a long time. But really, americans deserve for us to do the things we did tonight. And looks like we're doing it. Which is to find enough common ground to move this legislation to the president and to really deal with the major issue of taxpayers in this country. Decisions that will meet next congress, but a much better mood for next congress. 

[00:51:03]


>> Can you tell me about a conversation you just had on the floor that defines where we are at right now when it comes to congress? 
>> Well, I can say from my colleagues, democrats, I did have one interaction from a republican, who passed by. I said you are somebody I can count on, he said yes, I am. Actually that reassured me, i felt really good, not just for congress, what we have been fighting for a democrats. But really, when we do something this positive, its really very important to american families and businesses. And as I said on the floor for this nation and economic growth for the future. And I think we should feel pretty good about it. 
>> All right, you're feeling good about it right now, representative allison schwartz's close to getting the senate bill tossed over, wide bipartisan support going straight to the house floor now. I shouldn't say straight. It took a different route. Mike viqueira, you're sti here with me. And some said we're very close. 
>> Absolutely, I don't want to say it is a foregone conclusion, but it is shaping up very well. The seeds of more confrontation aree very easily. Others having a big chunk taken out of their paychecks, the markets have been calmed, fortunately the respect, i suppose all of this took place on a holiday. But in two month's time we have the triple jeopardy, the debt ceiling which the president has said he will not tolerate any gamesmanship on this, however, with the debt at $16 trillion and growing, and the country technically already hitting the ceiling. And with the treasury secretary saying he could buy time for moving things around another couple of months, it will require a vote from congress. It will be interesting to see how the president gets around that. Also we have the sequestration, that takes place tonight if they couldn't reach an agreement on spending cuts, but what they did is put off sequestration for another two months. And the third thing they will have to deal with is the bills that fund the government. They couldn't agree in the past year, no surprise there. They passed a temporary measure, we call it a continuing resolution around here, expiring around the beginning of march, as well, so all of those things expire, that is the argument they made to the rank and file. It was look, hold your nose, take it for the team on this one. We'll live to fight a better day, in march. 

[00:53:57]


>> Yeah, calling it march madness, could turn out that way with the three fiscal cliffs -- 
>> so at the white house, would this be a situation where we could see the president come out and make a comment here? 
>> I think it is quite conceivably, when you consider all the time and effort both behind the scenes and at some of the campaign-style events. Which have not incidentally angered republicans, since the election. The president traveling out of washington, mobilizing the campaign machinery, to try to put pressure on the republicans, which evidently has borne fruit here. I think it is quite possible we could see the president come out and sort of punctuate this effort and really set up the scene that we have been talking about for the next effort. Really, let's not forget that his trip to hawaii was cut short. He had to leave his family and come back, with this issue. It is quite conceivably that the president could go back and spend a little bit more time with them, since he hasgone a vacation over the summer and change his vacation plans. 
>> Vic, I want to bring in luke russert, we're seeing the numbers, 183. 
>> And look at the yay column, the numbers, is this looking good here? 
>> It looks good right now, richard, you have 66 republicans, 60 left to vote. They really needed about 75. 80, nancy pelosi was able to have the other votes with democrats. It is expected to pass, one interesting yes vote from the republican side, house speaker john boehner. Speakers usually don't vote. They usually reserve the right not to vote. But john boehner voted yes. And it is quite fascinating that he did that. It is rare. We still did not see that eric cantor voted yet. But there was criticism for lacking leadership among the voters. He is putting himself out there with the minority of his party, saying support this deal. 

[00:56:13]


>> Vic, go ahead. 
>> I'm sorry, richard? 
>> Mike viquiera, go ahead. 
>> I just wanted to point out something here, one of the problems all along is that republicans didn't want to violate a core principle of conservativism, a core pledge that they made, never to raise taxes or revenues. This individual grover norquist, who has sponsored this pledge, I'm going to read a tweet from grover norquist that we've just seen here. He said the bush tax cuts lapsed at midnight last night. Every republican voting for the senate bill is cutting taxes and keeping his or her pledge. And richard we talked about this in the -- 
>> it just passed, just passed. No more time remaining, it now has passed the house with the senate amendment. 
>> Okay, and now we're heading well over, just caution, let's wait until the gavel comes down, but strange things can happen. Right, 220 -- it is heading north. Appears that the deal is done. We'll move on to the next fight here. What I said was, richard, you and i, a lot of us talked over the course of the last several weeks, going over the cliff would make it more feasible for republicans to vote. Because after all, after midnight they were not voting to raise taxes, they're voting to cut taxes. And after not violating the pledge of grover norquist, and not violating their core believes and their core principles, they did have some problems with the lack of spending cuts in this bill. And that is what they were talking about earlier today, trying to put something, amend the senate bill, add spending cuts. That really would have been both a legislative and -- because of the mechanics, a new congress being sworn in on thursday. But 236, now, I'm going to say we could probably declare this bill passed. 

[00:58:20]


>> All right, 217 here, luke, you know, you have to feel quite gratified, too, you have been there all day in the capitol, watching the members. And is there really a difference in the mood here, we have spoken to members. Democrats seem to be quite excited at this vote. They have been asking for it to come to the floor. Is it very different on the other side? 
>> Well, before I get to that, i think something I should point out. You see there are about 81 republican votes right now. This is technically a violation of the hastert rule, which john boehner said he wanted to abide by, speaker john boehner has seemed to throw that to the wayside. As I mentioned, supporting this deal himself. As opposed to the mood, it was funny, john boehner, eric CANTOR, McCARTHY, THEY MADE THIS Decision not to speak on the house floor about this deal tonight. Who did we hear from? From nancy pelosi, taking a victory lap, which I think says a lot about how both sides feel about it. At the end of the day it is about the law of the land, and after all the twists and turns, folks on both sides are breathing a sigh of relief. Tomorrow when they wake up, they will know the majority, they know the taxes will not go up. The financial markets I'm going to guess are going to react positively to this deal.

=======================================================

Andomen working inside the u.S. Capitol right now will answer that question in just the next few hours. We are hearing and very good evening to you. I'm richard lui. The fiscal cliff showdown in washington. The house gop leadership considered an amended version of the senate's fiscal cliff bill, which would include around $330 billion in spending cuts. Nbc news is reporting there are not enough votes for the amended bill to pass. Now, without those needed votes, speaker john boehner is prepared to bring the senate deal to the house floor for an up-and-down vote possibly tonight. The senate bill is expected to get around 170 democratic votes in the house, meaning it will need roughly 50 republican votes to pass. Now these developments come after house republicans were on the verge of rejecting the senate bill earlier today. House gop leader eric cantor telling the caucus he could not support the bill without spending cuts. All right. Let's turn to nbc's mike viqueira who has been covering all the latest developments from washington on this. So vic, the reason we're in this place, ts has something to with a fig leaf? 
>> Well, I think so. I think plainly what happened here is after it became apparent earlier in the day that the house republican conference did not like what the senate did in the wee hours last night at 2:00 in the morning, that they wanted to amend that bill, thereby throwing this whole thing into question and putting us on the fiscal cliff for possibly days more. They stared into the abyss after there was an eruption here on new year's day. And they saw that it would have been a publicns disaster. The senate would not have acted on any bill that they put on the floor that would have changed the senate bill. That means there would have been a new congress. That means the legislative slate would be wiped clean after thursday noon when the new congress is put into session that the economy would be thrown into chaos. The markets would be thrown into chaos. People's paychecks when they start to go back to work tomorrow would have a huge bite taken out of them because of the rising taxes. Put all that together, put a media firestorm, a scene at the capitol which was close to chaos with members meeting behind closed doors moving back and forth, and what has happened now is essentially the gop has decided to cave, put that clean senate billiton floor and vote on it tonight. And it really looks as if at this point the skids are definitely greased for the house of representatives to move forward now. A vote on that senate bill and pass it, send it to president's desk as early as later this evening or early tomorrow morning, richard. 

[00:02:39]


>> Somewhere around 9:30 we're hearing possibly, right? It could be that soon? 
>> Yeah. Well, they start the process to put the bill on the floor in just a few minutes. In the house of representatives everything goes on the floor has to go through a committee on rules. Later in the afternoon the republican leadership made a show of attempting to find the votes for an amended bill. I think it's clear, and I think they knew that there would not be the votes there. They couldn't expect to get any democratic support for that. House support, republican support seemed pretty thin on the face of it. And, indeed, what they have done at this point is sort of fold up their tents. They're going to put that clean senate bill on the floor. This comes after an afternoon, richard, you and I have been talking all afternoon of real tumult in washington here when it became apparent that house republicans were against this bill. We're going to try to amend it. That plan now out the window. They're going to pack it up. They're going to vote on the senate bill, vic. 
>> You're an old pro, as I like to say. You run up and down the halls there in d.C. So many times. 
>> Yeah. 
>> Did speaker boehner plan on this from the very beginning, that he was going to definitely bring this ultimately to the floor for the up or down vote? 
>> Here is the expectatio richard. The expectation finally when the speaker's plan b, I guess about ten days ago on a friday when he put that billiton floor, you recall it was the income threshold at one million, and only those who hearn more than that would see their taxes go up. And it didn't even get enough support there because republicans don't want to vote for any tax increases. It became apparent then when he essentially punted to it the senate and asked the senate to take care of it. And we followed all the ups and downs of that. And finally vice president biden getting involved over the weekend, negotiating a bill with mitch McConnell and putting it on the floor. 2:00 a.M. This morning, it passes the senate by a vote of 89 to 8, was it. I've said it so many times now, I've almost forgotten it, richard. 89-8. And the feeling was in washington, and there was sort of a nod and a wink going on here, and I think you saw that on both ends of pennsylvania avenue that once house republicans and the speaker saw that just an enormous wave there, a bipartisan wave coming at them from the senate, there really was nothing they could do to stand in the way of that. And ultimately, that's really what has happened here, richard. 16 hours ago was when we first got that deal, that 89-8. It seems like so long ago. Thank you so much again, mike viqueira covering that story for us. 

[00:05:12]


>>> Joining us right now jared bernstein senior fellow. The public amendment being considered here, it's swapping defense and domestic cuts. How does that make sense here? Talk about that, if you could. 
>> First of all, let me point out, as mike very correctly said, that amendment really doesn't seem like it's going anywhere, if you're someone who wants this bill to get over the legislative goal line is a very good thing, once you get through the up or down votes, democrats join on and you have a pretty good chance of getting over. Look, what the republicans have been trying to do all along is arguing that the thing they don't like most about the senate bill, and that is house republicans, is that it doesn't include enough spending cuts. Now when it comes to spending cuts, they're there are basically three types. Entitlements, which the white house isn't doing on this round, and there is defense and nondefense, domestic. They don't want to cut defense. White house isn't going to give them anything on entitlements right now. And so that leaves this part of the budget that is the nondefense discretionary part. And that's what they would like to target here. If they were to do that, if that kind of amendment were to pass, the bill would die, because the democrats have already given as much as they plan to at the office. 
>> You know, the senate bill as it stands, the one that came over 16 hours ago at 2:00 in the morning, it's got at least a dozen major moving parts to it. Now that you had a chance to look at it, who got more out of this deal, do you think? 
>> It's a great question. I think that the republicans got some important things, but i think the democrats and the white house got more. But it's actually pretty balanced, which doesn't surprise me given that biden and McCONNELL SAT DOWN WITH REAL Compromise in the room. The revenue number at the end of the day, 600 billion, is well below where obama started. And remember of course he had the threshold for income tax rates expiring at 250,000. Now they're going to expire at 450,000. So that certainly lands more on the republican side of the field. They also got a better deal on the estate tax. They have parameters on the estate tax that are more favorable to the very wealthy estates. But democrats did get the unemployment benefits extended for another year. They got refundable tax credits that help a lot of low income people extend it for five years. And of course they did get higher income tax rates on wealthy people, above 450,000, which is something they've been looking for a very long time. 

[00:07:48]


>> From $250,000 to 450,000. 
>> Right. 
>> Jared bernstein, thank you so much as we will watch the clock in the next couple of hours. Perhaps something may happen. Jared bernstein, thank you again. 
>>> Joining us is congresswoman debbie wasserman schultz and the chairwoman of the democratic national committee. Congresswoman, thank you so much for spending time with us this evening. 
>> Absolutely. 
>> What we're hearing from our report on the hill is speaker boehner asking his members if they would vote for the amendment to the senate bill. And if a majority won't back it, if he can't get the 217, he'll let the senate bill hit the floor for a up or down vote. When we look at this, is this really just about the house republicans, or a certain portion of them being allowed to vent? 
>> Well, it's definitely a head-scratcher. Why the republicans, any of them would want to risk allowing taxes to go up for 98% of americans and 97% of small businesses is really mind-boggling. But from what I understand, the house rules committee is going to go in, that they're actually I think in their meeting right now, and they are planning on bringing theenate bill right to the floor with no amendments. And we'll have a straight up or down vote on the senate fiscal cliff deal between mitch McCONNELL AND THE VICE President. And we'll see. When democracy has an opportunity to work, whether the majority of the house of representatives, not justhe majority of the majority, as speaker boehner has rigidly adhered to prior to now, but whether the majority of the house of representatives can come together and put our differences aside and not engage in the my way or the highway tactics that have been employed over far too long. And that will be great news for the middle class if that happens. 
>> The majority of the house, the numbers we were saying at the top of this hour, 170 democrats is what we're hearing at the moment. It would take 50 or so republicans. Do you think it's 170? Is that a reasonable number you believe from your caucus? 

[00:09:48]


>> Well, I'm not sure what the count in our caucus is. But I certainly hope that it's more than 50 republicans. I mean, this is something that should garner, you know, I'd say -- I'd like to see 100 republicans supporting this. We've got to put together this 218 votes. We'll have a good strong vote from our caucus. It feels like that's what is going to come out of the house democratic caucus. But I would be -- it would be a little bit pitiful if only 50 republicans vote to say we shouldn't raise taxes on 98% of americans, we shouldn't extend unemployment benefits for two million people for another year, we shouldn't extend the american opportunity tax credit and make sure that more young people can go to college, the earned income tax credit or the child -- the child tax credit. So the that are in this deal are essential for the middle class. And not passing this is going to really leave the middle class in a significant world of hurt. And I don't understand why republicans would vote to do that to them. 
>> You've been watching, no doubt, what has been happening throughout the last 24 hours very carefully. We've been watching our cameras here. We see speaker boehner coming and going. This has certainly not been an easy time for the speaker. 
>> No. 
>> If and when he does take the senate bill to the floor, do you consider that an act of bravery on his part? 
>> Well, I -- I would just say finally, finally. Because we had an opportunity so many other times to bring a bill to the floor that was balanced. That's what president obama and democrats have called for all along. We've never said it has to be all our way. We've been willing, and will continue to support significant spending cuts to reduce our deficit. We know we need to make sure that the wealthiest americans pay a little more to add to that deficit reduction package. We know we're going to need entitlement savings. This is the first step towards significant deficit reduction. We would have prefer to do it in the $4 trillion deal that president obama proposed, but now we'll do it in steps. Going forward after tonight, i hope this passes. And then going forward after tonight, any subsequent deal needs to also have balance. And that's what people need to keep in mind. We're not going to continue down the path of lopsided deals that balance l the pain on the backs of the middle class. Those days are over. 

[00:12:13]


>> We're speaking to one vote in the yes column should that senate bill make to it the floor. Thank you so muc congresswoman debbie wasserman schultz and happy new year to you. 
>> You too. 
>> We will continue to watch what is hatching on capitol hill. We expect something to happen perhaps around 9:30. If that does, we'll have it right here for you on msnbc throughout the night for the latest on what is happening on the fiscal cliff. ] ] that? That's the sound of car insurance companies these days. Here a cheap, there a cheap, everywhere aheap... You get it. So, what if instead of just a cheap choice, you could make a smart choice? Like, esurance for example. They were born online and built to save people money from the beginning. It's what they've always done. Not just something they cheap about. That's insurance for the modern world. Esurance. Now backed by allstate. Click or call. 

[00:14:35]


>>> Coming up, it was the tape everyone was talking about. We'll look at how mitt romney's 47% comments changed the presidential race. 
>>> And later, from voter purges to long lines. Americans faced many obstacles to cast their vote this november. Ohio state senator nina turner joins me to discuss the fight for the right to vote.

>>> Welcome back to xoloitzcuintli year end edition. Women's health care, equal pay for equal work, birth control. Those were the issues that republicans decided to tackle in 2012. It wasn't a year in which republicans at the state level tried to force women considering an abortion to have an invasive and medically unnecessary ultrasound. Pennsylvania republicans even proposed requiring women to review the ultrasound. Governor come corbett didn't understand what the fuss was all about. 

[00:16:54]


>> Making them watch, does that go too far if your mind? 
>> You don't make anybody watch, okay, because you just have to close your eyes. 
>> It was a year in which republican presidential nominee campaigned on defunding planned parenthood. Wouldn't take a position on the lilly ledbetter fair pay act, and bragged about his hiring practices as governor of massachusetts. 
>> And so we took a concerted effort to go out and find women who had backgrounds la could be qualified to become members of our cabinet. I went to a number of women's groups and said could you help us find folks. And they brought us whole binders of women. 
>> It's a year when republicans pushed for candidates like todd akin and richard mourdock. 
>> If it's legitimate rape, the female body has ways to shut that whole thing down. 
>> I struggled with it myself a long time, but I realized life is a gift from god, and even when life begins in that horrible situation of rape, that it is something that god intended to happen. 
>> It was a year in which we had to hear rhetoric like this. 
>> This contraceptive thing, my gosh, it's such inexpensive. Back in my days, they used bayer aspirin for contraception. The gals put it between their knees and it wasn't that costly. 
>> That was the kind of year it was. And it all started back in february when republicans held a hearing on the affordable care acts contraception mandate, no women testified. Democrats were allowed to invite one witness. They chose georgetown law student sandra fluke. Chairman darrell issa rejected mrs. Fluke as not qualified to speak on the matter. Flukentually gave her testimony inront of a democratic congressional panel and became a target of the biggest voice of the republican party, rush limbaugh. But before limbaugh could launch his smear campaign against a private citizen, sandra fluke gave her first national interview here on the "ed show." Great to have you with us tonight, sandra. Now I understand that you had already planned your testimony. You were going to cite some examples of people who could have benefitted from president obama's mandate for birth control coverage. Share with us what you would have told that committee today. 

[00:19:11]


>> That is what I was there to speak to the committee about. And that's why I was so stunned when chairman issa made the decision to not allow me to speak on behalf of those women, and to say that I was not an appropriate witness, that those women's stories were not appropriate for this committee. I cannot think of who would be more appropriate for the committee to hear from than the women who were affected by this policy whose lives were affected. One of the women I wanted to talk about today is a close friend of mine. She has polycystic ovarian syndrome. What that means is she needs to take contraception for medical reason to prevent cysts from growing on her ovaries and not to prevent pregnancy. That technically means that should it be covered on georgetown student health insurance which does not cover contraception for prevention of pregnancy, but unfortunately, when university administrators and employers and insurance companies get involved in deciding whose health needs are legitimate and whose aren't, what happens is that women's that type of ideology. And that's what happened in her case. And we found that that happens in 65% of the female students' cases. So for her, she was unable, they repeatedly refused her contraceptive coverage claims, and she had verification from her doctor. It didn't matter. She had to pay out of pocket about $100 a month for her month after month after month, and eventually she just couldn't afford it. Like many students just cannot afford that kind of a cost. And she had to stop taking it. And I have to tell you, it's -- so what happened is after a few months of her not taking the prescription, a massive cyst grew on her ovary. And she woke up one night in the middle of the night in excruciating pain. She told me that it felt like she had been shot. And I just can't -- I don't want to imagine what that felt like for her. But what ultimately happened is she had that ovary surgically removed. She had to have it surgically removed. And as a result of that, of course she would have problems concving a child. But even more, it just -- it hasn't stopped for her. She -- she since the surgery has experienced symptoms of early menopause. And her doctors are very concerned that at the age of 32 she is entering early menopause, which means that there will be nothing any doctor can do to help her to conceive a child. And it will also put her at risk for increased risk for cancer, heart disease and osteoporosis. And that's where she was this morning when I was attempting to tell her story to the public and to members of congress. She was at the doctor's office trying to cope with the symptoms she is experiencing. >> Are people on campus, are they talking about this story? Has this really hit the attention of women that you interact with professionally in the school setting? 

[00:22:21]


>> Oh my goodness, unless you've studied at one of these schools, I can't even explain to you what it's like on campus. We have been following these regulations for -- ever since the affordable care act was passed. And it's a fight we've been having for years, literally decades. Students have been struggling for this. So this makes such an incredible difference in our lives, in the lives of so many women. 
>> Sandra fluke, I rea appreciate you being here tonight. I know they watch on capitol hill. Great testimony here on "the ed show," and I think you're probably going to get an opportunity to talk more with people who will be in a position of making a decision that will affect the lives of women. I really appreciate you being with us tonight. Thank you so much. 
>> Thank you for having me. 
>> You bet. 
>>> Coming up, mitt romney's caught on tape comments revealed his true feelings about the poor in this country, next. How the 47% changed the presidential race. And we traveled the country to bring you the stories of workers fighting to keep their jobs as republicans tried to dismantle labor unions. Later, john nichols joins me on the future of organized labor, and much more. Stay tuned.He more you lose because for every 2 pounds you lose through diet and exercise, alli can help you lose one more by blocking some of the fat you eat.

[00:26:28]


>>> welcome back to "the ed show." Thanks for watching. One video defined this year's presidential campaign more than anything else, mitt romney and the 47%. 
>> Been told this, don't worry, we'll take care of them how. Are we going to do it? In two months before the elections onvince everybody you've got to take care of yourself? There are 47% who will rote for the president no matter what. There are 47% who are with him who are dependent upon them that believe they are victims, that believe government has the responsibility to care for them, who believe that they're entitled to health care, to food, to housing, to you name it. It's entitlement. And government should do it. And they will vote for this president no matter what. I mean, the president starts off with 48, 49. He starts off with a huge number. These are people who pay no income tax. 47% of americans pay no income tax. So our message of low taxes doesn't connect. He'll be out there talking about tax cuts for rich. That's what they sell every four years. And so my job is not to worry about those few. I'll never convince them. That they should take personal responsibility and care for their lives. What I have to do is convince the 5 to 10% in the center that that are independents, that are voting one way or the other, voting in some cases on emotion, whether they like the guy or not. 
>> Does mitt romney really think at people in this country want to be on medicare, that they want to be poor, that they want to be disabled? That they want to have assistance? Is that really the path that he thinks that americans want to take? And most americans I believe tonight, especially liberals are going to be absolutely offended by the comment. My job is not to worry about those people. I'll never convince them that they should take personal responsibility and care for their lives. Personal responsibility. Personal responsibility. Those of you who are in nursing homes, those of you who are in wheelchairs, those of you who depend on assistance by the government because we are a government of compassion, we have always been a country of compassion. But all of the sudden the republicans are putting up a candidate who wants to wipe away that because we want to privatize everything. The obama campaign has also responded. It's shocking that a candidate for president of the united states would go behind closed doors and declare to a group of wealthy donors that half the american people view themselves as victims entitled to handouts that are unwilling to take personal responsibility for their lives. It's hard to serve as president for all americans when you've disdainfully written off half of the nation. And that is exactly what mitt romney has done here with this statement behind closed doors. For months on this program, i have asked will the real mitt romney please stand up. In this video recording that he didn't know about, he got behind closed doors, we saw the real mitt romney. He did stand up. He doesn't give a damn about those who need assistance in the country. And it cuts to the very fabric of who we are as a country that we are a society, we are a country of compassion, that we want to help people who are downtrodden. We want to help people who have been dealt a really tough deck of cards, whether it be in the economy or whether it be health care, as of no fault of their own, or circumstances that are put on families that are totally out of their control. Mitt romney wants to do away with those. We views those people basically as road kill. And he is not even going to communicate to them, and he is not going to offer up a better plan to make their lives better. He just says they should be personally responsible for who they are and where they are in america. But romney made the matters only worse for himself. 

[00:30:11]


>> It's not elegantly stated. Let me put it that way. I'm speaking off the cuff in response the a question. And I'm sure I could state it more clearly and in a more effective way than I did in a setting like that. And so I'll -- I'm sure I'll point that out as time goes on. But we don't even have the question given the snippet there nor the full response. And I hope the person who has the video would put out the full -- the full material. 
>> No, no, no, wait a minute now. Don't have the question? Just a snippet? We played the full question and answer last night on this program, and we were not alone in doing so. President obama supporters were surprised and disappointed when the president didn't mention romney's 47% remarks in the first debate. But president obama made up for it later. In the second debate, on the final question when romney could not respond, president obama got the final say on the 47%. 
>> When he said behind closed doors that 47% of the country considered themselves victims who refuse personal responsibility, think about who he was talking about. Folks on social security who have worked all their lives, veterans who have sacrificed for this country, students who are out there trying to hopefully advance their own dreams, but also this country's dreams, soldiers who are overseas, fighting for us right now. People who are working hard every day paying payroll tax, gas taxes, but don't make enough income. And I want to fight for them. That's what I have been doing for the last four years. Because if they succeed, i believe the country succeeds. 
>> There is a lot more coming up in the next half hour of the "ed show." Stay tuned. 
>> I just got to say this. What we shouldn't be doing is trying to take away your rights to bargain for better wages and working conditions. 
>> In 2012, president obama came up big for workers, but not before the workers came up big for him. John nichols of "the nation" magazine on the year in labor, next. 

[00:32:19]


>>> Voter id. Which is going to allow governor romney to win the state of pennsylvania, done. 
>> And in 2012, republicans thought they could suppress their way to the white house. But the voters would not be denied. 
>> We will not be turned around. 
>> Ohio state senator nina turner joins me ahead. prepaid me. ?????? ?????? I have direct deposit on my visa prepaid. My paycheck is loaded r on my card. Automatic. Am not going downtown standing in line to cash it. I know where my money is, because it is in my pocket. I got more time with my daughter, we got places to go. 
[ Freeman ] GO OPEN A NEW WORLD, With visa prepaid. More people go with visa. 

[00:35:45]


>>> Good to have you back with us. Thanks for watching this special year-end edition of the "ed show." We covered workers issues yearlong, but we wondered how the middle class would come out and vote on election day. Well, in the end, the middle class workers turned out in record numbers to reelect president obama. His victory was never a sure thing. The story I think starts with workers in wisconsin in 2011. Let's roll it back. Republican governor scott walker threatened to destroy collective bargaining in the state. Workers staged massive protests and launched the first recall election in the state's history. We covered the recall from madison. 
>> Polls close in an hour here in wisconsin, and we have already seen a ground operation unlike anything in wisconsin political history. 
>> What we're seeing here in wisconsin is something that is proving to be far more powerful than money, and that is the power of the people. 
>> Of course, governor scott walker survived the recall. Republican operatives were delighted. They claimed this was the end of organized labor. 
>> It is a blow for organized labor, particularly organized labor's represented in public employee unions. It's going to embolden other efforts in other states by governors. It's clearly going to put wisconsin into play in november. 
>> Karl rove, who was later taken off fox news and his buddies were all so wrong. Middle class voters helped reelect president obama four months later. Wisconsin also elected the first openly gay woman to the united states senate. Democrat tammy baldwin defeated tommy thompson by five points. It turns out labor is alive and well. In fact, workers across america help us understand what mitt romney could mean for the economy. 
>> This is "the ed show." Let's get to work. 
[ Cheering ] 
>> we followed the workers' stories to freeport, illinois in october. Bain capital has shut down the sensata plant and there going to ship some 200 jobs to china. 

[00:37:49]


>> What would you say to mitt romney? 
>> The three of us have been arrested defending american jobs. We're waiting. Come on out here and talk us to. 
>> You want to talk to him. What would you say to him? 
>> Save our jobs. 
>> Over the summer, more and more workers started coming forward with horror stories about bain capital and the bain economy. Workers at gst steel made national headlines. 
>> When you take away all the good paying jobs such as we had here at gst steel in kansas city, the middle class is going to become extinct. 
>> The republicans answered with misleading ads and huge lies. Like this ad romney ran in the state of ohio. It claimed jeep was moving to china because of the automobile loan, and it was totally false. It had totally backfired on the camp. Auto workers and their families turned out in full force on election day. And of course president obama won ohio. Middle class americans across this country stood in long lines to cast a vote for the candidate who would help them the most. They ignored the republican threats about a failing economy. The republicans wanted to kill organized labor. In 2012, they may have given it new life instead. Here is someone who has been with us all yearlong covering workers' issues. Joining me tonight, john nichols, washington correspondent of "the nation" magazine. John, it has been a very eventful year when it comes to labor. Has labor been emboldened by the obama victory in november? And is there really been a new stage set for what they can accomplish? 
>> I think so. I think labor changed over the last year and a half, and especially over the last year. One of the things is that it is safe to say that a lot of unions, not all of them, but a lot were on autopilot. They had a sense of how politics worked. They had a sense of how government worked, and they fit into that. What happened in wisconsin and in ohio in 2011 forced unions to start to rethink, to start to recognize that there really were powerful forces that were out to get them. That made an awfully lot of unions, afsme, teachers unions, firefighters, recognize that they had to fight for their very livelihood. I think it made them much leaner, meaner, and more effective political players. And once you've started to win tough battles as has happened in ohio, as has happened in a number of states nationally in november, then you start to think about what you might be able to accomplish not in a defensive position, but in an afative position. 

[00:40:22]


>> Of course, the conservative movement in this country has vilified unions for last 30 years. And of course, they want to take out their infrastructure. Operatives like karl rove have been very clear about how forceful they want to go after unions to tear down the last great bastion of infrastructure for the democratic party, which is labor unions. But do you think it has awakened another level of workers in america that are not involved in organized labor? 
>> I think there is simply no question. That's exactly what has happened. Because people who were never members of unions were out there in those demonstrations in michigan, in ohio, in wisconsin, also in places like new york city and los angeles as part of the occupy movement, and more recently as part of the protests against walmart as part of the fast food workers' walkouts and strikes that have occurred. The fact of the matter is that we've got a new era for labor, and it isn't fully defined. A lot of unions are starting to figure out how to work with people who aren't members, a lot of people who aren't members or unions are trying to figure out how they would fit into a labor movement. A lot is going to change. But the fact is that labor is no longer on autopilot. Labor is really affirmatively moving into new areas. And that's going to change not just our politics, but potentially our work life. 
>> And, of course, if you look at the tax policies of the republicans, they want to favor the rich all the time, which brings me to the point, did republicans get into trouble when they talked about funding for teachers and police officers and firefighters? And this basically I think set up the scenario for the obama campaign to target in on the middle class and the people who had been targeted by the right wing back in 2011. 
>> You're so right, ed. In fact, I reported with you on election night. I was in the teamsters hall in toledo, ohio. And off camera, I would talk to the teamsters who were there, folks not just from that union, but from other unions. They said you know, we started working on this november 2012 election back in 2011. 

[00:42:34]


>> Yeah. 
>> We recognized that we were under assault, and we had to -- we couldn't just stop when we won a referendum or a single vote. We knew it was l fight. 
>> All right. John nichols, it's been a great year. We look forward to 2013. Great to have you with us tonight. Thank you so much. 
>>> Coming up, we discussed a lot of serious topics in this election year. But here at "the ed show," we still had time for a few laughs. We'll look at some of the lighter moments, next. Aig? We said we were going did. 
Woman: We're helping joplin, missouri, come back from a devastating tornado. 
Man: And now we're helping the east coast recover from hurricane sandy. We're a leading global insurance company, based right here in america. We've repaid every dollar america lent us.

I wish my patients could see what I see. ?????? ?????? that over time, having high cholesterol and any of these risk factors can put them at increased risk for plaque buildup in their arteries. So it's even more important to lower their cholesterol, and that's why, when diet and exercise alone aren't enough, I prescribe crestor. In a clinical trial versus lipitor, crestor got more high-risk patients' bad cholesterol to a goal of under 100. 
[ Female Announcer ] CRESTOR IS NOT RIGHT For everyone. Like people with liver disease or women who are nursing, pregnant or may become pregnant. Tell your doctor about other medicines you're taking.

>>> Up next, coach ed -- that would be me -- gives the president a pep talk. And I've got a bedtime story for t-pa. 
>>> And later, republicans trying to block the vote and hand mitt romney a victory on election night. But voters across the country refused to be silenced.

[00:47:06]


>>> Welcome back to "the ed show." The 2012 presidential campaign was intense start to finish, but we here at "the ed show" also took time to poke some fun at the candidates, you know. During our coverof the new hampshire primary, failed pridential candidate tim pawlenty of minnesota told me he couldn't stay awake long enough to watch "the ed show." The very next night, we decided to give 2% timmy a sleep aid. 
>> Good night to unions, good night to health care, good night jobs, good night clean air. Good night, public education. Good night, immigration. Good night, wall street regulation. Good night, middle class. Good night, auto czar. Good night dog on the roof of the car. Good night roe v. Wade. Guide marriage equality. Guide the old lady whispering "don't privatize social security." Good night, medicaid. Good night, medicare. Good night, american dreams everywhere. Sweet dreams, t-pa. Sleep just as good as your presidential campaign. Nighty-night! 
>> Oh, t-pa, they were easy to pick on. Good targets, don't you think? But just to be fair and balanced, we had some fun with prident obama's performance in the first debate. The president was really off his game that night in denver. So, well, the very next night, i had to give liberals some hope during a postgame news conference. 
>> All right. Not a good night. We didn't play very well. Unusual for us. We're hell of a team. We got a long way to go. I know you're not happy. I heard the fans. I heard it. And you're hearing it from me. We're better than that. 
>> What about your point guard? 
>> Point card is fine. Obama is great. That's why we recruited him in 2007. He is a hell of a player. We won championships with him before. We're going to win begin.

>> Coach, there going to be a lineup change? 
>> No there is not going to be a lineup change. There is going to be a change now? Look, did he turn the ball over? Yes. Did he throw the ball out of bounds? Yes. He missed a few layups, but he is still my guy. We're not changing the lineup. I told you guys when you started covering this team in the year earlier, this is going to be a long road. We're on the road. I don't know about playing in altitude. The kid seemed pretty good before the game we thought we would play very well. We didn't. We got to get over it. 
>> Cch, what about the other team? 
>> The other team, if you guys want to go out and crown them the champion, you go right ahead and do it. But I think you would be making a huge mistake if you did that. I mean I know -- you know what we got to do? We got to get to work. 
>> We're not sure if president obama saw the press conference, but he sure did destroy romney in the next final two debates. 
>>> Coming up, long lines couldn't keep voters from casting their ballots, despite republican attempts to keep them away from the polls. Ohio state senator nina turner on the fight against voter suppression, next. from Is bigger than we think ... like the flu. With aches, fever and chills- the flu's a really big deal.

[00:53:27]


>>> Welcome back to "the ed show" year-end special. Leading up to the 2012 elect we saw unprecedented efforts by republicans to suppress the democratic vote. 18 states have passed some kind of voter suppression measure since early 2011. Some of the toughest laws came out of swing states with republican governors, states like ohio, pennsylvania, wisconsin, and florida. In ohio, early voting hours were cut and new restrictions were put on absentee ballots. Down in florida, republicans put restrictions on early voter registration, cut early voting, banned felons from voting for ten years. And attempted to purge thousands of voters from the state's public rolls. Luckily after public outrage, the voter purge failed. Meanwhile, states like pennsylvania and wisconsin put in place strict voter id laws. Pennsylvania's law was eventually struck down, but misleading signs and billboards like this one were put up to try and trick voters. These suppression efforts directly targeted minority in low income areas there is no doubt they were meant to help elect mitt romney as president of the united states, and republicans admitted it. 
>> Voter id, which is going to allow governor romney to win the state of pennsylvania, done. 
>> Ohio county gop chair doug price put it this way. He said, quote, we shouldn't contort the voting process to accommodate urban red african-american voter turnout machine. Not accommodating all voters led to record long lines on election day. In the state of florida, there were reports of people waiting in line as long as seven hours to vote. These voter suppression tactics must stop, and president obama said he wants action on it. 
>> Whether you voted for the very first time or waited in line for a very, very long time, by the way we have to fix that. 
>> In the wake of all of this, california senator barbara boxer introduced the line act. It would require an election commission to set new national STANDARDS BY JANUARY 1st, 2014. This commission would decide the minimum number of voting machines, workers, and other resources. The act would hopefully keep voting lines under one hour-long. In the end, the republican voter suppression measures didn't work. Tonight we want to honor voters who turned out in huge numbers and waited a long time to cast their votes in the states we're talking about. They didn't quit. And president obama came away with the win. I'm joined tonight by ohio state senator nina turner. Senator, good to have you with us. We commend you here on our year-end special tonight. 

[00:56:14]


>> Thanks. 
>> You have been absolutely the stalwart fighter there in ohio, an information source and a real leader and inspiration in many cays. What do you think the federal government can do to curb voter suppression now that we have been through it in 2012? What can the government do, if anything? 
>> Well, thank you, ed. And you've been quite a champion yourself. But the federal government needs to aggressively enforce the voting rights act, the civil rights act, and any other federal statutes that are on the book. For example, through help america vote act, there was a commission established called the elections assistance commission. Ed, that commission is supposed to be a bipartisan commission with four members. It doesn't have members because the republicans have been holding that up in congress. It is very important that those on the federal level enforce the laws that we have there. And that elections assistance commission would go a long way. Would be a clearing house for some of the best practices in this nation to continue to drive the polls, that voting should be for everybody, not a select few. And we really need to make sure that the federal government uses the tools that are in their tool box and not sit idly by and let things happen in the state and across the country. 
>> In your state of ohio, republicans unfairly targeted minority and low income areas with voter suppression tactics that is well documented. 
>> Yes. 
>> But if this law were to pass, the line act that senator boxer has put in place, would this really clear up the problems you saw in 2012? 
>> I think somewhat, ed, and i commend senator barbara boxer for standing up for all voters in this country. But ultimately, voters hold the key. And voters have got to continue to vote for policymakers and executives who respect the power of the vote, and not those who try to suppress it. So even though the feds need to do their job, senator boxer, i give a big shout out to her, ultimately we have to continue to empower voters. Ed, my biggest fear is now that now that the shining bright lights of the presidential election is over, that folks will forget that there are elections all over this country every single year. And as you stated in your intro, there are voter id laws on the books right now. And so we have to stand up and continue to be a champion for voters all across this country, including the state of ohio. And I certainly plan to lead the charge along with my other colleagues in the new general assembly to push for election laws that create a level playing field for all voters. 

[00:58:41]


>> You know, we had talked back in october and leading up to the election that this was going to motive the democratic base. That mation now turns to not only coming out to vote, but to get registered. 
>> That's right. 
>> Is there going to be an off-year effort like 2013? Should the democrats go down the road of making sure voter registration is taking place and not in the 11th hour? 
>> Yes, absolutely, ed there is an african proverb that one should never build their shield on the battlefield. Well, it is shield-building time for democrats. Absolutely we certainly plan to do that right here in the state of ohio. Well need folks who understand that when it comes to elections, ed, our party affiliation should be placed on the side of the road. And there is only one affiliation that we should worry about, and that is the party of the rt. That is the right thing. 
>> Nina turner, great to have you with us tonight. Senator, you have done a marvelous job for your state. We don't have a top five or top ten of favorite guests on "the ed show," but I guarantee i would put you in the top five. 
>> Thank you. Thank you, ed. 
>> That is "the ed show." I'm ed schultz. "The rachel maddow show" starts right now. Have a happy and blessed new year.

=======================================================

The u.S. House of representatives on this january 1st, 2013. It is 21 hours into the first day of the year, and we are awaiting a final vote to keep the u.S. Economy from falling to the bottom of the so-called fiscal cliff. Good evening. I'm richard lui. We will be with you throughout this hour as we await a vote in the house which we expect to happen soon. The senate did its part early this morning by passing a bill to extend the bush era tax cuts for 98% of american households. This afternoon, house republicans revolted against the senate bill. Republican leader eric cantor said he would not support the bill without spending cuts. Then after a second meeting later in the evening, itecame clear there were not enough votes among house republicans to pass an amended version of the senate bill, basicly approving changes to that senate bill. That left the house speaker john boehner with the option ofesn't do. Taking up a clean version of the senate bill as it was passed over to them. A procedural rules debate is going on right now. Back to those live pictures on the house floor. The bill itself will be debated within the hour. We expect a vote shortly after the debate concludes. Let's go to nbc political director, chief white house correspondent, host of the daily rundown, chuck todd. Chuck, great to see you. Is this it? 
>> I think this is it. Never underestimate this congress in particular. This has been one of the most contentious two years of a relationship between the white house and this congress, particularly this house that we've seen. So don't underestimate their ability to snatch defeat from the jaws of victory, if you will. But it's very likely this is going to get through. It's a numbers game now. It's probably going to be more democrats than republicans that support it at the end of the day. Is it going to be 80 republicans and the rest with democrats? It is going to be 60 republicans? And so at this point, that's what is going on on the floor right now. Each side is trying to see if they have enough votes and trying to put together the math. But what we don't know for sure is are they fully working together? Are the leaderships on the house democrats and the house republicans working together to figure out their numbers? They haven't gotten to that level just yet. But it's likely that they will. But this has been a long day. And it's been tough for these house republicans, because let's remember, richard, these are folks that they believe they had their own mandate in november of 2000. They won nearly 80% of them won with a greater share of the vote in their districts than the president did nationally. And so while the president believes he had a mandate, and you look at the exit polls when it came to the issue of taxes, these house republicans also believe they had their own mandate. At's why the politics for them is so tricky. But also let's not forget, richard. After all this is said and done and the tax cliff is essentially avoided, that's all that happened, we are setting up for a march madness of budget showdowns coming up in two months when the debt ceiling, the government's funding, and then rest of sequester all runs out basically at the same time. 

[00:03:07]


>> As we watch the floor here, chuck, as they're debating the rule, and then they'll get to the vote later on on the senate bill itself, what is the discussion around the numbers? You've been very clear to say we need 217. 
>> I mean, part of it is look, republicans are upset there weren't any spending cuts in here. I've talked to some democratic lawmakers in the house and senate who frankly were a little surprised they didn't figure out how to put nor spending cuts in this bill when biden and McCONNELL NEGOTIATED THIS, THAT That wasn't done. And they were nervous, if you will, that this was going to meet the reception that it met a little bit in the house. But, you know, a part of today was also meant to be therapeutic. House republican leaders, they get a lot of people like us that criticize on how they manage their members. And in the good old days, leadership used to be able to jam these things through. We kind of watched how the good old days work in the senate. Leadership agrees on a bill. HARRY REID, mitch McConnell got out there and look what happened. Nearly 90% of each of their sides vote in order bill. They came together and said we've got a bill and you saw what the vote was, nearly some 90 votes. That's not the way the world works with this house of representatives. And I think house leadership has been trying to explain that and if you will, educate news the media sometimes about this. So they had to let them wear themselves out today, the rank and file. They have. They've come to reality of where the votes are and where they aren't. And that's with a it leaves us right now. 
>> And those who haven't followed speaker boehner, have not followed leadership, they have some sort of approach to this entire matter saying i don't need to fall into rank and file here because I was not voted to represent necessarily the issues of the country per se, but that of my own constituency. And how strong does that idea run true for those who object to this bill as well as plan b before? 
>> Well, just remember, political compromise has only happened when you feel like you get rewarded at the end, that there is some sort of reward for you politically. You know, nobody votes for these things with their own political bravery, or vote against their own political interest. It's just the way our districts are drawn. And so there was never -- what these republicans are having a hard time is finding the political benefit here. They're being asked to raise taxes, isn't that they haven't done in more than two decades as a political party. And they in their minds didn't get anything in return to take back to their constituents. And their constituents largely mostly are more conservative electorate if you will than what you see nationally, could very easily vote them out. So they don't see the political win for themselves here. And that' what I think you've seen such a difficult between boehner and the president to come to a deal together. The reason a deal happened BETWEEN mitch McConnell and the WHITE HOUSE IS mitch McConnell believed in the long run it was more politically beneficial for republicans, at least in the senate, to get this issue of the taxes off the table and then have a straight spending fight, if you will, a spending cut fight when the budget issues of march arise. But that if taxes were part of this, and it looked like republicans were holding middle class taxes hostage, they had no leverage with the white house whatsoever. so McConnell was viewing -- that's why a compromise happened, because he saw himself getting a potential victory out of this. I don't know if that's the way it's going to work out. But at least that's what he saw. 

[00:06:32]


>> Chuck do, the republicans in the house now have cover we are passed, we're into the new year, over the cliff by the clock. Therefore they're voting for not tax increase, which, again, was the concern here, number one. And then number two, when we take a look at the vote on the senate bill on the house, do they get that cover that they need? Do they have the fig leaf that has been talked about so much? 
>> I've always thought that was silly. It's as if it sounds like john kerry when he was trying to argue that he was for the supplemental and the iraq war troops before he was against it. You try the make that argument and any political consultant worth a darn could easily make somebody look like a typical washington politician trying to hide behind semantics, whether they raise taxes or cut taxes. So I think that's always been sort of a silly fig leaf, if you will. That doesn't mean I didn't have -- I had some republicans who said that -- that did quote could make life easier. But they didn't believe that was going to be able to make their life easier, frankly, unless the new congress came in, that they actually -- don't forget, we're not really over the cliff. This is the old congress. This is the law that still -- it's still on their watch. It's still sort of last year, if you will. So not technically, but it is as far as this congress is concerned with enacting law. So that's why I don't think it really works here. 39 more hours of the 112th left for that group before the 113th does come around. Before we let you go here, chuck, what would get in the way here? We expect a vote in the next hour or so. But what could get in the way? 
>> Well, if suddenly there is only 35 or 40 republicans. Let's say eric cantor and kevin McCARTHY, THE NUMBER TWO AND Number three in leadership, decide to vote no. Well, then how many republicans are going to feel comfortable voting for this bill if two of the top three leaders won't vote for it? As I had one republican member say to me, you can't expect us to be, quote, brave and help get this bill passed if the leadership themselves won't be brave. So that could make things stumble. And let's not forget the left. A lot of progressives, particularly labor doesn't like this deal that happened in the senate. Mad at some democrats. What if nancy pelosi can only produce 130 democrats rather than 150, 1 of, 170. I don't think that's going to be the case. But you're asking how it could fall apart. That's how it could fall apart. 

[00:09:01]


>> We're hearing now, chuck, that the vote timing could be as late as 11:15, 11:00, in that range. Should we make anything of that? 
>> No. It's just part of the way -- they have to debate the bill. Right now they're debating the rule on the bill. This is all procedure. And the timing of the actual vote will depend on how much debate time each side wants to take. And I wouldn't be surprised if a lot of these members actually don't want to be saying anything. That's why this process could speed up a little bit. But it looks like if you just look at the way the rules work, 10:00, 10:30 at the earliest, 11:30 at the latest. 
>> Great perspective as always. This it is. It could be it. Thank you so much. Nbc news political at the white house chuck todd. 
>>> Congresswoman, thank you for being with us today. 
>> Thanks, richard. 
>> We have a sense of how the country will step back from this cliff according to what we're hearing at the moment. Is this how you imagined congress would solve the problem of their own creation that was done a year or two ago? 
>> Well, I'm disappointed, of course, that we don't have a comprehensive solution. I think a grand bargain would have been the right thing to do. But ultimately, the last thing we need to do is three our country into another recession just when we're in a recovery. And so I think most democrats will vote for this compromise tonight. We're not really happy about it. There is a lot of things we would have liked to have seen that we didn't. We don't like those income levels for the taxes. But on the other hand, we realize we have a responsibility to the american people to do the right thing. And the right thing is to not let everybody's tax rates go up tomorrow. 
>> So you're going to vote for it? 
>> I'm going to vote for it. And, you know, I'm a chief deputy whip for the democrats. I've been talking to a lot of my colleagues. I think chuck todd's analysis is right. I think a lot of democrats realize it's the right thing to do, but we're not -- we're not whipping, we're not trying to persuade people to vote one way or the other. We're just taking an informational whip to see where we're at. And I think most democrats realize that the question is will the republicans come to their senses so that we don't really go off the cliff tomorrow. 

[00:11:11]


>> Just speaking from your side of the 193, how many do you believe will be saying yes to this senate bill? 
>> It's really hard to say. We still have a lot of uncommitted people. And a lot of us feel that the republicans, they have the majority. They're the ones who are supposed to be running this place. They have a responsibility to the american people to really put some numbers up there on the board. And to say, yes, we can do what the american public wants to do and go across the aisle and compromise for the good of our country. 
>> You know, a lot of people are discussing the issue of the so-called hastert rule. You know, that's the principle where the speaker of the house, in this case john boehner. 
>> Right. 
>> Doesn't bring anything to the floor, doesn't mention a bill that doesn't have the support of the majority, of the majority party. In this case, the majority of republicans in the house. That's exactly what speaker boehner is going to have to do tonight. How much credit does the speaker deserve for bringing this to a vote despite opposition from his very own party? 
>> Well, I think it's pathetic that we have stooped so low. Because if this last election tells us anything, the american public wants the parties to work together across the aisle. This so-called hastert rule started a few terms ago where the republicans say we're not going to bring a bill to the floor until we have a majority of the republican party, 218 votes. And of course what that does is it creates gridlock, because it has the most extreme legislation. It doesn't have bipartisanship. And it dies in the senate. So I'm hoping that tonight's vote where democrats and republicans will do the right thing, will herald well for the next congress, where people can come across the aisle and work together for the good of this country. That's what we need to do. 
>> Do you expect, congresswoman, for hastert rule then to have -- it's gone. Now that he is going across and he is not following that rule, that we don't see this again as a major rule when considering whether to bring a legislation to the house floor? 
>> I would hope it would be gone, because don't forget, in the next congress we have even more democrats. We have 201 democrats. The republican majority has shrunk. And so to pass meaningful legislation, we really are going to have to put together coalitions. I will tell you this. I have a lot of friends on the other side of the aisle, and I've been approached by a lot of people since election day saying we need to start working together. I hope that's true. I hope the republican leadership really puts their money where their mouths are. 

[00:13:34]


>> You saw the president as he came out amongst the background of middle class tax payers, and he made that speech there at the end of the week on friday. And then he also released a statement on his website describing how this deal coming through the senate was a success. How was that viewed by those on the other side, the jump shot congress members that were very much against this deal? 
>> I haven't talked to any of the republicans about what they thought about the president's statement. I think the president, like the rest of us, has been very frustrated. We all knew this deadline was coming. Knew when it was coming. We could have worked together in an orderly fashion to have a grand bargain. And I think that frustrates all of us, the lack of initiative by the republican leadership in the house. Having said that, it looks like they have come to their senses at the 11th hour. Sort of like the kid running into the professor's office to turn in their term paper at midnight. At least we're finally doing it. And at least we will avoid these massive tax cuts for the middle class. That's good news. Now we have a lot of hard work ahead of us in the next two months with the sequester and with the debt limit coming up. And I would argue that we should do it in regular order, and we should do it in a bipartisan, bicameral way working with the white house. 
>> We've got several cliffs in front of us. Chuck todd was describing those. We've got the sequester. We've got the debt ceiling. When we look at the other three cliffs coming up right now, what does this process tell us about what we're going to be seeing in the coming months? 
>> Well, I would hope that what it would teach us is that we really can work together. We can compromise. As I said, I don't like every detail of this -- of this compromise. I don't like the income levels. I don't like the fact some cans are being kicked down the road. But ultimately I think it's good news, and there are some good things. The unemployment insurance is extended for a year. The physician reimbursement under medicare is extended for a year. So there are some really positive steps here. But I would hope that we won't be here at the 11th hour next time, because that never makes for good legislation. 

[00:15:51]


>> Congresswoman diana degette, thank you very much. Have a very good new year.

They are working steadily and heavily inside the building on the first day of 2013. Also in there nbc news correspondent luke russert has been at the capitol all night watching this. Luke, you know, it started at 2:00 a.M. 
>> Yes. 
>> There were some positive signs coming from the senate, and boy, that is a long time away from right now. What is the latest you're hearing in terms of timing? 
>> In terms of timing, I spoke to a few gop aides, and they think about 11:00 for final passage. And just I say that, richard, and just a few hours ago when we spoke we had no idea that this bill was even going to get to the floor. 
>> Right. 
>> So it's just been an extraordinary turn of events today. It's been like a roller coaster, up and down, sideways, every which way you could think. But they are confident that this bill will be a bipartisan vote, will get a lot of democrats, a decent amount of republicans, and most likely pass by 11:00, latest 11:45. The goal is to try to get it done before the midnight hour, GET IT DONE ON JANUARY 1st. 
>> You and I have been popping our blood pressure pills all day. 
>> Indeed. 
>> Since 6:00. What is happening on the floor right now? What are we seeing? 
>> The rules debate just ended. That's a procedural motion. The party that is in power usually puts forward the rules of debate. So how a bill will be debated on the floor. This sometimes is an interesting look to see who is against a bill moving forward. It kind of gives a rough idea if someone votes against the bill they don't want to have any more debate. Sometimes we take that as a sign that they're against the bill. So you're going to actually see after this a movement to about an hour debate on the senate legislation, the one that got the 89 votes. It will probably be interesting. You'll hear mostly people speaking for it. You might hear -- boehner might give the opportunity for a few folks to voice their dissent. But overall, from where we spoke a few hours ago, complete 180. The house leadership is essentially silenced the folks who had an issue with this legislation. And that compromise that mitch McCONNELL AND JOE BIDEN SPENT All night working on, it's moving forward and could become law in the next day or so. 

[00:22:02]


>> You know, one of the issues was eric cantor, the second ranking gop member there in the house. He had said he could not support the senate bill. Might it be possible here, luke, that we will see the speaker vote for it, and we'll see eric cantor say no? 
>> Certainly it's possible. Usually the speaker of the house doesn't vote on legislation unless the party that they're a member of absolutely nds the votes. So occasionally you see it. Nancy pelosi was there for the important health care vote. But if they only need to get to 218, they can get there without john boehner, he most likely will not vote tonight. As for eric cantor, it's probable he will probably support this, but you never know. What they're saying,hat happened earlier, look, he understood that the conference did not want to support the bill as it was without an amendment. They tried to have an amendment. The amendment process wasn't able to get 218. So trying to move forward. Also, eric cantor is very tied in to wall street. And a lot of finance republicans, the ones I talk to who talk to those guys from the big banks, they did not want to see the markets open tomorrow with this deal up in the air there was definitely a pushback from that community as these negotiations move forward. 
>> We saw the dow react positively there the other day. And then it could go negative again after we have seen a long string of decreases in the dow index leading up to this vote. And that one pop in the dow of over 100 points. 
>> Right. 
>> Because there was word of a deal coming through there. They're feeling very positive about that. 
>> And foreign markets are opening, as I'm sure are open now in some parts of the world there is that fear that the foreign markets will start to go down on the u.S., And that it could lead to it all going to haywire tomorrow. 
>> January 2nd in many parts of the world. Now one of the -- just to drill down a little more on this hiccup, and those who were against this senate bill, why did that need to happen at 4:00, 5:00, 6:00? Now that you and have I the benefit of context of time or looking back and it doesn't look like that's going to be a problem, did speaker boehner know that he had to do that? And he just was going through what he knew he needed to do? 

[00:24:09]


>> It's a fascinating question, richard, because I've followed speaker boehner very closely since he has become speaker and when he was in the minority as a leader. And he has his philosophy you never get too high, you never get too low. He doesn't really pay attention to media reports. He doesn't worry if people think his conference is in chaos. And there is now a belief among some members I have spoken to that this was boehner's plan all along, that he was giving his conference a chance to vent, a chance to get their anger out there, and then was presenting them, okay, if you want to try to go down a different route, you guys find the 217 votes. The 217 votes did not exist in the republican conference for an alternative. Now there is a lot of other people that say this is boehner just -- he passed the buck to the senate. He got jammed. He didn't know what to do. There was a rebellion, and he didn't do enough to squash it. So there is two views out of it. But I will say, richard, it's fascinating. Boehner's philosophy has been in all these fights, give this rebellious part of his conference a voice, and it's kind of a prodigal son routine. They get angry, they go out, he ends up welcoming them back with open arms, and then they move forward as a unified republican party, at least in their discussions. But we in the media then sort of dissect the interesting divisions that have occurred. And you saw them quite front and center today. 
>> It is fascinating to watch this. We watched the speaker adjust his political management style and how that may change or how that will change in the 113th congress. But certainly he has faced some challenges in the 112th just over the last two years. Nbc news correspondent luke russert on capitol hill tonight, providing so much good information and perspective to us on this day. He will be with us throughout the lead-up the vote when it does happen, right, luke?

[00:29:10]


>>> All right. We are watching here at msnbc the breaking news that we expect to be happening within the next hour or so. Live pictures of the house floor. They were going to have one hour of debate on a rule. We understand that. They're going to vote on a rule, then have an hour of debate on the senate-passed bill. That's the news that we're watching in this hour, 9:30 p.M. Eastern time. Then they'll have a vote on the senate passed bill for 15 minutes. So all that being said, just to summarize, as we expect within the next hour or so, or maybe a little bit longer for a vote, up or down on the senate-passed bill that came out at 2:00 a.M. From the senate. It was very much a bipartisan effort. 89 and 8. And then it was sent over the house. Watching that with us is mike viqueira. You're at the white house right now, mike. And what might be the reaction from the white house to what is happening so far. Talk about what is on the floor. I'm looking at one of the tweets you sent out about ten minutes ago. You started by saying "holy cow." 
>> I think we're on the express train here, something tells me tonight, richard. You look at this vote here. Normally the debate, we call it the rule here for all you legislative geeks. It is basically the rule that governs the debate for the upcoming legislation. That of course being the senate bill that the house has now decided, as luke was just describing a moment ago. Finally, after a day of chaos and tumult on the house floor, that they were just going to sort of throw in the towel and put it on the house floor. And you look at this vote. You see the bottom, the tallies. 165-2. These votes on this procedural vote, these rule vote, these are almost always straight party line votes. And you see that it is passing with an overwhelming majority, which sort of tells you that these folks have had enough. And the skids are greased for this thing. And the estimate for a final vote was about 11:15. Something tells me we're going to see the gavel come down considerably earlier than that, richard. >> Okay. You and I will be watching that. What about the white house? Any response so far on the developments today after the 2:00, 2:00 a.M. Bill was sent over from the senate? What has happened between then as the president or the white house made any comment about what has happened within the last six hours, for instance? 

[00:31:30]


>> I think they were sort of laying low at the white house. I think they started out the day with a bit of confidence that the house was going to take this up and pass it. You look at the vote last night. You keep mentioning the tally, 89-8. This were only five republicans and three democrats on opsite sides of the spectrum for different reasons who voted against it. Jeez, on a piece of legislation this controversial, there has been this much pain and heartache and struggle and negotiation, that has gone into it, so much controversy that has gone into it, that deals with such issues that are so visceral for the core and the base of each of these parties to have a vote like that, a lot of people felt like it was going to be sort of a tidal wave coming from the senate side through the rotunda, and to sort of wash away the opposition within the house republican conference. But as they used to say on "get smart," not quite, zig freed. The house republicans met in the morning. It was very apparent there were serious problems. They felt as if they weren't anywhere near the measure of spending cuts that they would like to see in this bill, that they were voting to raise taxes. Actually technically after midnight, richard, as you know, they're voting to cut taxes. Because after midnight, as of midnight last night, everybody's taxes got raised considerably. So there was talk of putting an amended bill on the floor, sending it back to the senate. And richard, as you and I have been talking about all afternoon, throughout this chaotic afternoon, that would have really thrown a wrench into things and raised a distinct possibility this would bleed over past thursday noon when the new congress is sworn in, which would sweep the legislative slate clean and they would have to start all over again. 
>> Don't even say that. 
>> There was such a firestorm raised that house leaders decided finally just to take the clean senate bill, put it on the floor. And as we're witnessing right now, it really looks like the skids have been greased on this thing, richard. And it's going to pass relatively quickly at any rate. 
>> Just to give us that context and perspective, when we were discussing the possibility of a senate bill being cobbled together and passed in a bipartisan fashion, the numbers that we were talking were in the RANGE OF THE 70s. So when we came out with this 89, that was a huge number. 

[00:33:39]


>> Well, it's remarkable. And I think part of the rationale that republican leaders used in the senate and they tried to use in the house and they're still using in the house is look, we're going to give in on this thing. The president is holding all the cards. We're up against this deadline. But we will live to fight another day. And that day is coming relatively soon. It comes in early march when three things are going to happen. The bill that funds the government, there is a temporary bill that was passed just before the election that is going to expire. The sequestered cuts as part of the bill they're putting off for two months, the indiscriminate cuts to defense and social programs are going to come due as well. And perhaps most importantly, the debt court of appealing is going to be hit. The congress is going to have to vote. President has said quite forcibly I'm not going the play this game. Really, the congress has to vote in order to raise that debt ceiling. And it's going to be hard to get around that basic reality. So we can expect to see, and i know this is going to be really heartening, a fight that is going to make this one perhaps look like tiddlywinks over the course of the next two months, richard. 
>> Vic, talking about congress voting. I'll let you go here. We're watching the numbers on the floor at the moment. We're seeing what appears like that the rule has passed. We're looking at 283 at the moment in that yea column. What might we take from the rules vote? Will it be parallel later on on the senate vote itself? 
>> I've been watching this stuff for quite some time. And I got to tell you, I've never seen a rule vote that has been this lopsided. It's hard for me to believe that the vote on the senate bill is going to be anything close to that. I think you're going to have a lot of -- and I'm looking at the monitor here -- I think you're going to have a lot of republicans, obviously core republicans who are not going to vote in favor of the senate bill. As a matter of fact, one of the things to watch here, richard, is exactly how many republicans they do get to vote for the senate bill because this is a bill that is going to have to violate that basic rule of the house of representatives. And it's not a new rule. It's not just a couple of decades old. It's a centuries old rule that the majority does not pass things unless they have a majority of the majority. But tonight they're going to have to rely on democrat put them over the top. The question remains how many republicans are going to vote for this, and how many democrats are going to be required to get to 217. 217 being the majority with three vacancies in the house right now, richard. 

[00:36:08]


>> Okay. We're watching that rule vote on the house floor right now. When that finishes, we expect within about an hour and 15 minutes or so for the vote to be complete on the senate bill that passed at 2:00 a.M. Thank you so much, mike viqueira at the white house. Joining us from the capitol is dave weigel. He is for the buzzfeed.Com site. Happy new year to you. I've been following you all day on what you've been tweeting. And so, I'm sorry, from slate. I apologize, dave. 
>> That's all right. 
>> When we look at what has happened so far and what vic is describing which is can they cobble together the right number of republicans and democrats, what do you think that's going to look like here? Vote similar to what you saw with t.A.R.P., What you saw with the eventual debt limit deal, which people forget it was spiked. At the end gabrielle gifford showed up and there was an emotional moment where some members changed their votes because they wanted to usher in some sort of bipartisanship. Nothing like that is going to happen this time. Republicans who are coming out of the meetings today are talking about the slight minority ory of votes. The lowest estimate I heard is only 50 republican votes for this bill. If that happened to be the case, you would need all about 15 democrats to vote for it. I think the numbers have edged up since then. I think there is a long game argument for republicans. And it goes backwards and forward. If you look back, republicans will say these tax cuts that we passed in 2001 and 2003, we're making most of them permanent. This is a huge victory for supply side economics. These are tax cuts we assumed if a democrat came into office, they would have all expired. They -- right now today they're expired. If we can force them into law for good, we'll mean we might never rise them again. We can take another bite at this. And another part of the long game is what mike was saying. In two months they're going to get a fight on what they think, what tom cole says, lindsey graham says is favorable ground to them on the debt limit. Democrats are not convinced. Democrats think republicans are going to lose that argument too. But there is a sense of exhaustion and a sense of kind of collecting theirngs and then going to the next table. 

[00:38:27]


>> Again, this could be it. This could have that vote. We could have the deal. It could be passed in the house. And it could go to the president as vic was saying, and it could be signed by the president tomorrow. We could have a law on our hands that gets us past the fiscal cliff. But the difficulty after that happens here, dave, is that for those republicans who have said -- been against this, those on the right, the tea party caucus, if you will, what will they say to their constituencies to make them okay, make them all right when they come up for a vote again in 2014? 
>> I think they're going to say look what we did for your tax rates. Look at what we did on the -- your -- the average voter in my district got a tax cut based on the january 1st baseline. Congratulations for that. We kept our pledge. I mean, there is always an odd cinderella aspect to this where at midnight it became a tax cut. A lot of people scoffed at that. But republicans took that quite seriously. Grover norquist has absolved them and said voting for this today is not voting for a tax increase of any time, even though you're restoring some of the top rates. I think they'll get pretty fwar that argument. They're going to need to deliver some more in 2013. It's going to be difficult. Again, they're convinced that when we come back to the debt limit increase, that we're going to have another discussi entitlement reform. Well, they have given up and lost a couple of big chances for entitlement reform. The best scenario they probably have had so far in the obama presidenas that summer in 2011 where the white house was surprised at every turn how far they were willing to go on demands with the debt limit. They didn't get entitlement reform then. They didn't get the super committee. They're not looking at a slightly smaller republican house majority and a slightly larger democratic senate majority cobbling some sort of entitlement reform coalition there in just two months. And I think they're going to have to -- there are going to be a lot of republicans telling their primary voters well, look, we tried really hard. You just need to send more us to washington so we can try harder.

>> It's going to be tough messaging, but we shall see what happens at the end of the 112th AS WE LOOK FORWARD TO THE 113th. And as you were mentioning there, the series of fiscal cliffs that are coming up in the first part, the first quarter of 2013 as we're now in the first day. Dave weigel, thank you so much, slate political reporter and msnbc contributor. I appreciate your time. 
>> Thank you. 
>> All right. Stay with us right here on msnbc. We'll bring you live coverage. We're watching what is happening on the house floor when that vote does happen, we'll be at it. We'll be right back. 

[00:44:00]


>>> This has been one of the days on the hill where the story has literally changed from hour to hour. A volatile new year's day. So much happening in the capitol. And this is what happened. Just to take you back, in case you're just joining us. Beginning in the wee hours, around 2:00 a.M., The senate passed a compromise cliff deal with a resounding 89 yea, but no senator claims true victory there. 30 minutes later, the president releases a statement lauding the agreement and saying it allows the economy to grow and the deficit to shrink. Around lunch time, the vice president meets with the house democratic caucus to sell his carefully constructed but fragile deal that he put TOGETHER WITH mitch McConnell. At about the same time, the house gop convenes. We quickly learn that house republicans may be staging a revolt. Majority leader here eric cantor and his peers begin rallying for amendments to that bill. Namely that. 
>> Want to add about $330 billion in spending cuts to that bill. Then at 5:30 this evening, the house gop conference meets again. By now, the senate has warned them they will not entertain any amendments, in other words, if it comes to them. That will not put it to the floor. And sure enough, gop opposition cannot gather enough support to pass those amendments anyway. Which brings us to tonight. Live on the floor at the moment, we look. House members preparing to vote on exactly what the sene suggested. We're watching this as it is being voted on. There were four things that needed to happen as they convened again this evening. We are now what we expect to be about an hour and 15 minutes away, roughly before we understand what the vote outcome is on the senate-passed bill. We expect them to start debate on the senate-passed bill on the floor. And we will be dipping in throughout that one it does start so that we can hear what some of the members are thinking regarding this bill. Joining us now is congressman steve israel, democrat from new york and head of the democratic congressional campaign committee. Congressman, you and I got to speak a little bit earlier. You're to be head down there in just a moment. What are you hearing at the moment in terms of where this might go? 

[00:46:17]


>> Well, I feel -- I mean, i hate to say it, because this is like deja vu all over again. And I repeatedly said I think we're close, and I think we're there, only to have house republicans pull t rug out from under us, throw a temper tantrum and walk away. But this time I think theyean it. And I can tell you that there will be enough democratic votes in the house of representatives to pass this bill, protect the middle class, get us some deficit reduction, and move us forward instead of off cliffs. So we will provide the votes. We'll provide the adult supervision that is necessary to govern, to provide for compromise, consensus and pragmatism and move us forward. 
>> Okay. We're watching debate right now. What issues do you expect to be brought up as we listen to different members throughout the next hour or so? 
>> Well, look. Show me a member of congress and I'll show you a speech waiting to be given. And so different members will have their right to express themselves on this. But what counts is the bottom line. The bottom line is 218 votes. And I hope and I believe that we're going to get to that point very soon. 
>> When you get down to the floor, how many democrats do you expect to good along with this? 
>> I don't know how many democrats we're going to have at the end of the day. I'm more interested in knowing how many republicans are going to step up and show us an ability to compromise and show us that they're more interested in moving the country forward and that protecting their own partisan politics. As I've said before, and I've said this almost from day one, house democrats will provide the votes necessary to get us off this cliff, to protect the middle class, to protect social security and medicare. So we will be there. Unfortunately, most house republicans in the tea party caucus have been awol, missing in action. Even when we gave them what they wanted, they said no to what they wanted. And so I will be satisfied when I see218 votes counted on the board, and I will tell you again that house democrats will provide the difference on a deal that the president supports, the vice president supports, harry REID SUPPORT, mitch McConnell, for goodness sake sorts. 89 senators supp. 

[00:48:24]


>> What is your thought on boehner to take to it the floor, have an upper down vote here? We've been talking tonight about the hastert rule. And nowhis would be the first time where the hastert rule is not being followed. What does this say about what will be happening going forward in the 113th congress? Do you think this is a new leaf, if you will? 
>> Well, it is the first time, and it is about time. We are sent here to see if we can find common ground not to have these ridiculous turnover republican rules that say you don't even bring a vote to the floor unless you have a majority of republicans agree to it. This should be a deliberate place, not a partisan place. I think the speaker realized he had no choice. He had run out of time. You know, we are off the cliff. So we had only one decision to make, and that is find a way to get this on the floor. He had to go through some twists and some turns and some gyrations to get to it. That's all very well and good. Let's just vote and move this country forward. 
>> What do you say to voters in your district regarding some of the things that democrats are not happy about? For instance, the threshold of 400 and 450,000? 
>> Actually, I supported that threshold. The president says -- has said that $250,000 initially should have been the cut off, that that makes you wealthy. It does make you wealthy in some areas of the country. It does not make you wealthy in my particular district or other high cost of living districts around the country. So I think that 400, $450,000 threshold is number one, good policy. But it also reflects an ability of democrats to compromise. The reflects the deal to compromise. The republicans wouldn't even support a million dollar threshold. We were willing to go from 250, to 450, this at the end of the day requires compromise. I think most people support that and support a willingness to show that compromise, so long as you are not giving up on your principles. 
>> All right, congressman steve israel, it has been jam-packed with events there in washington, d.C., Thank you so much. 
>>> Thank you. 
>>> All right, debate is under way as you look at the pictures on the left-hand side there. We'll watch that plus much more, we'll be right back. understands the need.

>> A new congress is going to do what we're not going to do here today is not something I can bring myself to do. I would like to vote for this. Because I do vote for lower taxes. I want americans to have lower taxes, but the other day in conference one of my colleagues pointed out that if in fact, you're spending the money you're taxing our future generation. We are taxing $1.2 trillion next year. We are taxing $1.2 trillion. We won't collect it, but we are taxing $1.2 trillion in deficit. The chairman of the ways and means committee, mr. Camp, also said we're not making it more simple, better or fairer. We're not getting rid of the nascar loophole, we're not getting rid of the electric motor scooter low speed loophole. We're not getting rid of a whole lot of tax things that are still here. But most importantly we're not taking things that the president himself said he would be for. Like getting the calculation of chained cpi, the consumer price index, social security, medicare, and pensions right which would, in fact, reduce the deficit going forward. So because of what we're not doing I cannot believe that this tax cut will in fact be followed with the spending cuts to offset any part of the -- sorry, the $4 trillion we're putting on the backs of future generations. So I thank all of you who will vote for it. I cannot bring myself to vote for it tonight and I yield back. 15 seconds.

Ing that is usually all quiet on new year's night is bustling with black suits and big debates at this hour. Inside capitol hill, house gop itself will decide if they fall in line with their comrades in the senate or stage rebellion demanding changes to the fiscal cliff compromise. Hello, everyone. I'm richard lui. Here's the latest in the fiscal cliff talks. 2:00 a.M. We had a deal sfr the senate with strong bipartisan support. Then this afternoon around 3:30 p.M., We heard that they would amend that bill and that there was not support for it from leaders. The house will then take a look at this, but we are hearing that the senate will hear none of it. They will not accept an amended bill. But for the second time today, the house gop caucus met to discuss the way forward with the senate bill itself. House speaker john boehner emerging sfr that latest meeting after proposing two options. First is an amended bill that would cut around $330 billion in spending. Republicans would then see if they had the 217 votes needed to pass the new bill. If they can't get the required number of votes, they would bring the senate bill to the floor for an up or down vote tonight or tomorrow morning. Let's bring in nbc's luke russert who is covering the latest development from the capitol. You were giving us some of those details. For those who are just joining us and wondering I thought we had a deal earlier today, what is happening and where are we at now? 
>> It's been an amazing day. When the senate passed their compromise that was negotiated BY mitch McConnell and vice president biden, that passed by 89 votes. But a lot of us thought on capitol hill that was it with the story and it'd be done. The one thing we've seen all through this congress is when it comes to the house republican conference, you can never be sure about anything. Sure enough, that came true around 2:00 p.M. Today when we got word that a lot of house republicans were upset with the deal because there were no spending cuts. Eric cantor came out against that bill. John boehner sort of held his ground and didn't say anything. Was trying to gauge his conference. After they talked to some leadership aides and they talked to other leaders throughout the conference, they went back at about 5:15 tonight. They spoke to their members and said we're going to give you a chance to vent by adding a spending cut amendment for $330 billion. But if you guys can't get the 217 votes on that, which will all be republican votes because not one democrat will support that, when they whipped it and are trying to get the 217 votes, if they can't get the votes, then the senate bill would go to the floor. It's very odd. A lot of people are asking if this has been the strategy and it's unlikely for them to get the 217 votes which it is, then why go through this? This is boehner's leadership style. He tries to let his conference vent, talk about their grievances. Oftentimes it's embarrassing for them like it's been far today. But they believe at the end when it's over it puts him in a stronger position as speaker for certainly the jury will be out on that. But going forward, as we speak right now the leadership is on the floor. There's other meetings going on right now. They're going around to members saying do you support this bill with the amended cut? If they get to 217 on that, they'll vote on it and it sends it over to the senate. But from what I've heard from a lot of members is the 217 votes is not possible on that because there's enough conservatives in the house that even with an amended bill regarding the fiscal cliff, they still don't like it because of so many things in there they think that -- 

[00:03:38]


>> still not enough. 
>> Quite striking, yes. 
>> All right. Luke russert, thank you so much for that. We will of course be watching that. The latest of what's being offered to the gop conference. Joining us now is jared bernstein. Jared, always good to see you. What do you make of this latest development in the fiscal cliff discussions? 
>> Who could have guessed the things we get screwed up at the house of representatives. Right? I felt luke just gave a very youthful rundown of -- let me try to simplify this in a way that makes sense to me and hopefully some viewers as well. If this bill is amended, that is if there are enough republicans to vote for that 300-plus billion in more spending cuts, then this deal is as good as dead as far as I can see. Because there's no way that -- it would have to go back to the senate. Because the amended bill would no longer be the one that 89 senators voted for. And there's no way it could get a majority in the senate. The democrats at that point in the senate would abandon the bill. So if luke's suggestion that this does -- that the amendment doesn't get over the goal line, it doesn't get the 217 needed, then there's an up or down vote on the deal that passed the senate yesterday. Now, that deal could pass in the house with largely democrat votes. And so then we're kind of back on track. So this looks like it might be -- because of this double option we just heard about, they're going to try this amendment. If the amendment fails then it's just an up or down vote. Because of that option, we may be able to get back on track. But without that second part of the option, the up or down vote that leader boehner said he would allow, things would probably be as good as dead. 
>> We'll see where that goes. There's also the markets. The markets are now opening around the world. It is january 2nd in some places. You used to serve as an economic adviser to vice president joe biden. How big of a deal, this current deal we're talking about if it doesn't go through, how will we see this effect the world markets? And therefore, for instance, how much it costs for us to borrow money as a u.S. Government from other policies around the world. 

[00:05:48]


>> So you're raising two questions there. One is what will happen in equity markets in the near term. They really don't like downside surprises around this kind of a deal. I think the market was kind of pricing in a solution and the market kind of saw a solution coming. Especially after the senate vote. So I think if this thing actually does die in the house, there'll be a big negative opening -- 
>> it's not built in is what you're saying? It's not built in right now. 
>> Correct. I think you'll see a big drop in equity markets if the deal dies. I think the expectations were things were going to go forward. In terms of interest rates, i don't think it's going to have that much impact in the near term. If we essentially go over and stay over the cliff because there's no deal, then a lot of bad stuff starts happening in terms of tax increases and spending cuts. That slows down a growth in our economy. And then we have a full set of problems of which probably rising interest rates is the least of it. 
>> Talk about your old boss, vice president joe biden and how key he was for this deal to get through. 
>> Well, you know, joe biden and I'm going to give mitch McCONNELL CREDIT HERE TOO. These are guys who remember the meaning of the word compromise. If you look at the deal, I was one person and one among many who was somewhat critical of certain aspects of this deal. I mean, I think both sides gave a lot. Both sides got a lot. I think going forward, the white house has a case to make that this was a good deal for them. But I thought it was a little bit short on the revenue side. Nevertheless that's precisely what you have in this situation like this where a couple guys LIKE BIDEN and McConnell who again are not folks sent to washington to shut things down. They know how to get deals over the finish line and at least up until a few hours ago it looked like they did. 
>> We shall see. That is a cobbled together compromise deal you're describing there. Two veteran politicians, McCONNELL AND BIDEN. Thank you very much, jared bernstein, for your time tonight. We'll be watching this together. Joining us now is democrat from new york jonathan israel. He's also head of the congressional campaign committee. Thank you for talking with us tonight. You've heard some of the details of what speaker boehner is now going to be doing. His two-option deal here. Now, if he is able to get that 217 votes, that's the question right now. But this amendment, it's very similar to one that was passed by this house twice before. Do you think this can make it again? 

[00:08:23]


>> It's unpredictable. This has become the congress of chronic chaos. Every time the people are willing to make a prediction, the unpredictable happens. This could have been done last week, last month. Every time we get close to a solution, the house republicans move further away. I hope that we're in a position tonight whatever fancy footwork that speaker boehner engages in, we can get to a vote. Give us an up or down vote. I believe there are enough democrats including me who don't love this deal but are willing to vote for it to get a solution. So give us a vote and let's get this done. 
>> Would you say 170? 150? What's the number you guess on the democratic? 
>> I want to see what the republicans can provide us. They need to come to the table and give us a sense of how many votes they have. I understand speaker boehner has to go through these gyrations to tell us the votings. That's fine. But this is not a baseball game that can go into endless innings. 
>> Said around 50 would probably go with this bill on the republican side. You need 217. 
>> I want to see how many votes they can produce. I do believe based on the vice president's discussion, there's a critical mass among democrats to come to a compromise that protects the middle class and avoids continuing over the cliff. But the republican party needs to tell how many votes they can produce. 
>> Talk to me about this. When they pass in bipartisan fashion, we saw 89-8. That's big. It passes so overwhelmingly for this special fiscal cliff bill, how does this effect the house and house republicans specifically when we had several very conservative senators on the right go for this bill? Does it all effect those which luke russert was just telling us that are o the right side of the republican caucus and the house still might think that this $330 billion is not enough? 

[00:10:24]


>> Well, this is why I've given up predicting because the unpredictable continues to occur. Yesterday who would have thought THAT AFTER senator McConnell, harry reid, 40 republican senators, 89 senators come to an agreement with the president of the united states and the vice president of the united states that this would still be up for grabs? The conventional wisdom was we could get this done fairly simply and quickly. But you have this extremism among the house republicans. They will invent any excuse they can find to get to no. We would like to get to yes. And I hope we can do that this evening. 
>> Now, after this fight is over on the fiscal cliff, what opinions should americans have of congress? 
>> Well, they should have low opinions of congress. Western sent here to get things done. We were sent here to state our disagreements and move on. Americans have every right to be frustrated with the house republican caucus that has been about obstruction, refused to compromise. That won't even take yes for an answer when we give them what they want. They have every right to be frustrated with a congress here.

>>> Welcome back to "hardball." Time for the "hardball" campaign 2012 post-game show. We're going to start with the highlights of the primary season and the low lights and then move on to the general election. Mitt romney summed up the gop primary season in a quote to donors. We had 20 republican debates that was absolutely nuts. And the tone was set early. In the august 2011 debate when the candidates were on stage showed their intransigence on raising taxes. Watch grover norquist as people go to work here. Let's listen. 
>> Well, I'm going to ask a question to everyone on the stage. Say you had a deal, a real spending cuts deal. 10-1 as byron said. Spenting cuts to tax increases. Speaker, you're already shaking your head. But who on this stage would walk away from that deal? Would you raise your hand if you feel so strongly about not raising taxes you'd walk away on the 10-1 deal. 
>> Whoa. Joining me now is review that list of greatness and other highlights and lowlights of the primary season michael steele who never had a year like this. Who was always a success over there. And howard fineman. That was a scene -- you come from the roots of the republican party, sir. Is that a good day or a bad day for the republicans? 
>> I think it was a bad day. And I thought it was interesting that later on that huntsman said, you know, I probably should have raised my hand and said I would have taken the 10-1 deal. I think he recognized after the fact that was a definitive moment where he could have carved out a new space on that stage and probably run the kind of campaign free of that baggage. 
>> He wouldn't have looked good after the election. 
>> I'm just saying, but I think that moment sort of solidified the rest of the story for the primary. 
>> Whenever a bill passes you want to be the ones who voted against it because you never get blamed for it. Or vote when it fails. 

[00:16:52]


>> I agree that was the beginning and end for jon huntsman. But also in the long-term the beginning of the end for mitt romney. 
>> How so? 
>> Well, because he began to lock himself into a position of grover norquisting himself for the whole election. And that played into who he was as a businessman. That played into the -- 
>> it's today's politics. They used to say you have to be the most segregationist guy in the south. You couldn't be an inch away from it. 
>> I guess you could say whatever an early primary season crowd claps for furiously is going to kill you in ohio. 
>> I'm thrilled thinking how great politics are. Let's get back to the iowa caucus. Iowa is another unique state. Romney's campaign b and the super pac that were supporting him were to annihilate. Newt gingrich was the biggest threat. They destroyed him. Let's watch here's a romney supporting ad destroying newt. 
>> You know what makes barack obama happy? Newt gingrich's baggage. He has more baggage than the airlines. Gingrich cashed in on freddie mac. Freddie mac paid newt $30,000 an hour. 1.6 million. Gingrich not only teamed up with nancy pelosi on global warming, but together they co-sponsored a bill that gave $60 million a year to a u.N. Program supporting china's brutal one-child policy. 
>> There's been a lot of discussion in my head and whether ads work in a general election. I don't think they work in october or september. People have made up their minds. But those ads out there -- tell me. 
>> In primaries they are deadly. And particularly in republican primaries. And that ad in particular for newt gingrich was devastating. Because it hit -- it was the kitchen sink. 

[00:18:53]


>> What did it say about him? 
>> It said that, you know, he's an insider. He's a washington pal. And, look, he even pals around with nancy pelosi. Didn't we just fire her? 
>> Did you see those loving looks they worked with the camera there. 
>> Quick on that. The interesting thing i thought -- if I were newt i would have pivoted off that caption of him and nancy together. That's what people are looking for. The partnership getting things done. 
>> But they were talking about global warming. 
>> The other thing about that ad. That was symbolic of the entire mitt romney campaign strategy in the primaries. Which was a sort of take no prisoners, attack the other guy strategy. It wasn't about philosophy. It did nothing to show that mitt romney was a committed conservative. It just showed that mitt romney had tons of money and clever consultants who could carve up anybody in his path. That left him with a lot of making up to do once he secured the nomination. The way he got the nomination as typified by that ad, showed weakness in his campaign. 
>> Let's go back to the strategy. Someone is going to be the republican nominee and that person is going to beat obama. You just have to be that nominee. Wasn't that the thinking? 
>> That was the theory. But neil sedaka made famous making up is hard to do. So once he secured that, having everyone fall in line and support him. 
>> How much verses can you do of that? Throughout the republican pri pair, mitt romney pushed himself to the right. Especially on immigration. Nearly impossible. By the way I don't think he tried one. Here's the immigration exchange that became a defining line on the hard right for romney. Let's listen. 
>> Let's stay on immigration for a second. Governor romney, there's one thing I'm confused about. You say you don't want to round up people and deport them but they have to go back to their home countries and apply for citizenship. How do you send them home? 

[00:20:57]


>> The answer is self-deportation. Where people decide they can do better by going home because they can't find work here to allow them to work here. So we're not going to round people up. 
>> What was wrong with that, howard? 
>> First of all there was a little titter in the background. First of all, the phrase self-deportation -- 
>> was inevitably a headline. 
>> Yes. And it managed to summarize everything that people didn't like about mitt romney. 
>> Like firing you. 
>> The firing you part of it and the whole technocratic part of it. That these are just sort of numbers on a spread sheet. These people will self-deport. The coldheartedness and cold-bloodedness of it just played into it. 
>> Like the bathtubs are going to overflow and they'll overflow out. 
>> It's not realistic. The hitering and the snickering you heard is like grandpa's going to wake up saying mitt said I'm going to self-deport. 
>> This was funny. And I hope it didn't ruin the guy's life. Rick perry the guy who was much celebrated as governor of texas. He was considered a serious contender. Many thought he'd win this thing until some lackluster debate tmplss gave primary voters second thoughts. Then came this moment. NOVEMBER 9th, BIG DEBATE. Here he is trying to remember the three government agencies he wants to get rid of. Let's watch. 
>> And I will tell you. It's three agencies of government when I get there that are gone. Commerce, education, and the -- what's the third one there? Let's see. Oh, okay. So commerce, education, and the -- 
>> epa. 
>> Epa, there you go. No. 
>> Seriously? Is epa one you were talking about? 
>> No, sir. We were talking about the agencies of government -- epa needs to be rebuilt no doubt about that. 

[00:22:58]


>> But you can't name the third one? 
>> The third agency of government, I would do away with the education, the commerce, and let's see. I can't. The third one, I can't. Sorry. Oops. 
>> He wasn't getting a whole lot of help from his pals there. That's where they come out and the first things you do in the debates. They start scribbling the notes when they get out there. Howard, I never heard oops before in a national debate. 
>> First off, props to john harwood there for milking it. 
>>> Up next, the right wing's most outgeous conspiracy theories. This is "hardball," the place for politics.U can actually use. Tragically, their buddy got sacked by blackouts. But it's our tradition! That's roughing the card holder. BUT WITH THE Capital One Venture Card You get double miles you can actually use. 
[ cheering ] Any flight, anytime. The scoreboard doesn't lie. What's in your wallet? Hut! I have me on my fantasy team. 

[00:26:23]


>>> Back to "hardball." Now that the final weeks of president obama's first term were upon us, it's hard to remember the bizarre conspiracy theories pushed about the president the last four years. Let's look back at some of the worst. First his 2010 trip to ind u ya. Up in arms over rumors about what the trip would cost. 
>> I think we know that just within a day or so the president of the united states will be taking a trip over to india that is expected to cost the taxpayers $200 million a day. We have never seen a trip at this level before of this level of excess. And I think it's not a good signal to send to the american people when the people are struggling right now. 
>> For comparison, $200 million a day would have surpassed the daily cost of the war in afghanistan at the time. I mean, that non-factual story from michele bachmann about the cost of obama's trip was started by an unnamed source on an indian news web source and got into the n there. We can't talk about conspiracy theories without bringing up rush limbaugh. Remember when the conference was canceled because of hurricane issac. He then floated the idea that president obama was involved with the weather reports showing that tampa might get hit. 
>> Got a hurricane coming. The national hurricane center which a government agency, very hopeful that the hurricane getting near tampa. This national hurricane center is obama. It's the national weather service, part of the commerce department. I could see obama sending fema in advance of the hurricane hitting tampa. So it's nothing but a bunch of TENTS AND RVs AND STUFF. Make it look like a disaster area before the hurricane even hits there. 
>> Was he laughing as his own b.S. There? Did you think rush limbaugh would warn us of a skewed weather report. Next an extreme case of fear mongering. What caused a republican judge down in texas to float the idea of a tax increase in his state? Well it was about the need to beef up the military personnel he said in case civil war breaks out because president obama got re-elected. Do you believe it? Here's judge head on that one. 

[00:28:50]


>> I'm thinking worst case scenario. Civil unrest, civil disobedience, civil war maybe. We're not just talking a few riots here and demonstrations. We're talking lexington, concord, take up arms and get rid of the guy. He's going to send in u.N. Troops. I don't want him in lubbock county. So I'm going to stand in front of their armored personnel carriers and say you're not coming in here. And the sheriff I asked are you going to back me? He said I'll back you. 
>> Loony toons. That was his case of a worst case scenario. Here's steve king with how president obama's mother managed to convince us all that her son was born in hawaii, not in kenya. 
>> I looked into that before he was sworn in for the presidency. We went into the library there we found the only two newspapers in hawaii. Each of them published the birth of barack obama. It would have been hard to fraudulently file the birth notice of barack obama being born in hawaii. That doesn't mean that there aren't som explanations about howy might have announced that from kenya. By telegram. The last goes on. 
>> By telegram. I guess she neglected naming her son barack obama might be hard for the presidency. 
>>> Up next from mitt romney's 47% video to president obama's debate disaster in denver, we're going to run through the turning points in the election.

[00:33:52]


>>> welcome back to "hardball." Now that we've marked the highlights of the gop primary, let's dig into the turning points of the genal election. First up the video that turned out to be the low point for the romney campaign. The taped comments to donors in florida that nearly half the americans are lazy and happy to be on the government dole. It's known as the 47% video. Let's listen again. 
>> There are 47% of the people who will vote for the president no matter what. All right? There are 47% who are with him, who are dependent on government who believe they are victims who believe government has a responsibility to care for them. Who believe they are entitled to health care, food, housing, to you name it. So my job is not to worry about those people. They should take personal responsibility and care for their lives. 
>> Never trust the caterers. Joining me again former republican national committee chairman michael steele and howard fineman. I cannot believe someone paid 10,000 bucks to go in there and then hurt the guy. Let's look at the 47%. If you're right about the election in terms of power, it's the numbers. First of all the occupy people, 1%. All of a sudden the 1% became the thing to talk about. Then the 47% being anybody on any kind of government benefit program whether it's disability or retirement or military pension. Everything was painted as bad. Where'd he get that number? 
>> You know, look. This election was all about the numbers. 23 million unemployed. One in six on welfare. But it was that 47% number that trumped them all at the end of the day. People galvanized around it because it was them. It was me. You're talking about me and my grandma. You're talking about everyday folks. And it really to the point that howard made earlier, really drew out that disconnect between the romney campaign and romney personally and everyone else. 
>> You think it's this brand of the shrug that it's people calling for everyone else. 

[00:35:55]


>> I think it's a cold calculated business look. 
>> I disagree. I think it's his philosophy and it showed. 
>> How do you know it's his philosophy? 
>> I'm guessing. 
>> You can't say it's his philosophy because he never told us what it is. 
>> I think he said nice things about ayn rand at one point. 
>> Bill clinton brought the house down. This is one of the great speeches ever, I think, and made the case for electing the president. Let's listen to bill at his best. 
>> Are we better off than we were when he took office? And listen to this. Listen to this. Everybody's forgotten -- everybody's forgotten when president barack obama took office, the economy was in free fall. It had just shrunk 9% of gdp. We were losing 750,000 jobs a month. Are we doing better than that today? The answer is yes. 
>> You know, I was thinking back to the fairy tale remark you made. But the guy's showmanship with the gesticulation, the hands, the cuff flashing, the way he presents his case. Very southern too. 
>> Yes. Earlier this year I wrote oh who needs conventions. What are they for anyway? They're for moments like that. I was on the floor for that moment. And it -- 
>> it worked. 
>> It was one of the most memorable things I've seen live in a hall or anywhere. That was bill clinton at the summation of his career. That was everything he'd learned about showmanship, about telling a story -- 
>> about politics. 
>> And about how to make the case for the president. He made it so simply, so clearly, so logically that you wondered why the supposed great speecher barack obama couldn't do it the way he did. And that's probably because the case he had to make somebody other than the president had to make. If the president himself said we were in a terrible situation when I came , it doesn't sound as compelling as when somebody else says it. 

[00:38:05]


>> I had a moment like that in new hampshire when clinton was running the first time. He was in new hampshire and got to the draft letter with the girlfriend problems. But the draft letter was killing him. Then he went from the field houses and gyms and spoke in the rounds and would go on the last question in the room he'd answer. And rick said to me nobody in our generation can do that. Only he can do that. 
>> What also impressed me about that, I was covering that same series of events. Was his will. Clinton's will to succeed. No quit in that guy. 
>> You take the worst falls in the world and come rolling back. Another turning point that threatening to derail this campaign and this is purely negative, I think, although good day for mitt romney. The president's listless performance in the first presidential debate which he said caused me to have a stroke afterwards. I was so apalled by it. Here's part of his closing argument. If you want to call it that, an argument, let's listen to the president in a bad night for him. 
>> You know, four years ago i said that I'm not a perfect man and I wouldn't be a perfect president and that's probably a promise that governor romney thinks I've kept. But I also promised I'd fight every single day on behalf of the american people, the middle class, and all those striving to get in the middle class. I've kept that promise and if you'll vote for me, then i promise I'll fight just as hard in the second term. 
>> I don't know. I don't know what to say even now because the man has so much juice and excitement about it. 
>> He did not want to be there. 
>> His brain's always working on two or three elite levels when you're with him. I went off the channel, I went off the stage. I don't want to be here. 
>> I think a lot of it had to do with how he feels personally about mitt romney. The idea he was on the stage with him I think was beneath him. That's what came across to me. This guy was some place else yeah it was his anniversary and everything else. But politically he was thinking why am I dealing with tier two. It came across. 

[00:40:06]


>> Now let's look at the impact of hurricane sandy. And the pictures we saw on television near the election like right before it, we saw the president of the united states a democrat facing a really tough re-election situation along with a pretty popular governor of new jersey. Here he is, the president, with the new jersey governor chris christie. A week before the election. 
>> We are not going to tolerate red tape and bureaucracy. I've instituted a 15-minute rule essentially on my team. You return everybody's phone calls in 15 minutes whether it's the mayors the governors, county officials. If they need something, we figure out a way to say yes. 
>> Whatever he said then is still important today because there's so much devastation in that area. It's worse than we even thought in the beginning. It's getting worse and worse. People without electricity. But that picture, I think it was just two people of different parties. And the biggest applause I've heard is can't we work together. 
>> Right. And that's what people wanted all along throughout this entire campaign was seeing the republans, the democrats, conservatives, and liberals coming together. 
>> Why do you think that's stronger than partisanship? 
>> I think that's there. And to christie's credit, he galvanized the moment through action. Yeah he said nice things about the president, but you saw a cooperation. You saw his government and the federal government coming together to solve people's problems. 
>> They were wearing the fleece. 
>> They had the fleece on. Sleeves rolled up. 
>> You guys are the best. I have to tell you I love politics. 
>> You do. 
>> I'm breaking the story here. 
>> We agree with you. 
>> When people rise to the occasion and do the right thing, it's great. And I love bill clinton coming to save his old rival and he did. Thank you michael steele and howard fineman. 
>>> Up next from etch-a-sketch to legitimate rape to 47%. We've got the most notable political quotes of the year. That's ahead. And this is "hardball," the place for politics. ] coughequence?????? #8. baby.

[00:45:59]


>>> We're back. 2012's coming to a close, but before it does let's look back a few of the most memorable quotations uttered this year. From the infamous to the absurd. Librarian fred shapiro has released his list. Joining us now is a columnist for bloomberg view and a reporter for politico. Here's the number one, actually the number seven quote of the year. It happened in march. While the republican primary fight was still going on. Romney had been pushed to the far right on a host of issues and the question many were asking was could he pivot back to the center in the general election. And then one of his top advisers said this. Let's watch. 
>> You hit a reset button for the fall campaign. It's almost like etch-a-sketch. You shake it up and start over again. 
>> I've never seen a guy just give away the signals. Here's our secret plan. There he did. 
>> Not only give away the plan, they then had to cancel the plan and didn't pivot to the center until that first debate many months later. So what that etch-a-sketch comment did was it almost cost them the election right there. Because it prevented them from scampering back to the middle in time on issues like immigration. And it didn't allow romney the running room that he needed with the centrists and swing voters he needed to win the election. 
>> And also saying I don't believe a word I spoke since i began running for president. Here's one for you, ken. If one comment crystallized the overwhelming trouble the republican party had with american women voters, it was this. Take a look at number six. 
>> First of all, from what i understand from doctors, that's really rare. If it's a legitimate rape, the female body has ways to try to shut that whole thing down. 

[00:48:05]


>> I love the double whammy, this guy. Let's start with the first part. If it's a legitimate rape. What did that mean? 
>> Well, what it meant was absolutely unjustifiable. And it was the reason that the potential for todd akin to sort of go off the reservation on an issue that was already one the democratwere seizing on and prepared to hit him on show why democrats wanted him to be the nominee. To the point where they advertised democratic super pacs in his pri pair for the nomination to run against claire McCASKILL IN MISSOURI. Ads that said that todd akin is too conservative for missouri voters. He would not represent you well. He's never voted to raise tacks. He's opposed to abortion. And republican primary voters there say this sounds like our kind of guy. So democrats meddled in that primary. Got the candidate they wanted and he self-destructed like they wanted. Making what should have been a tough re-election fight for McCASKILL IS CAKE WALK. 
>> We always get our man. AND claire McCaskill got her man to run against. Anyway, the president bounced back from a bad first debate performance with two strong showings. Here was a memorable line from the third debate that ranked as the number five quote of the year. Take a look. 
>> You mentioned the navy for example. That we have fewer ships than we did in 1916. Well, we also have fewer horses and bayonets because the nature of the military changed. We have these things called aircraft carriers where planes land on them. We have ships that go under water. 
>> Meanwhile perhaps the most memorable moment patronizing. Meanwhile, the most memorable moment occurred in the second debate. Take a look at the number four quote of the year. 
>> I think it's interesting the president just said something which is that on the day after the attack, he went in the rose garden and said that this was an act of terror. 

[00:50:05]


>> That's what I say. 
>> You said in the rose garden the day after the attack it was an act of terror. It was not a spontaneous demonstration. That what you're saying? 
>> Please proceed, governor. 
>> John, there is so much to that phrase, "please proceed." Was that constitutional law class? 
>> I love that. 
>> What was that? Was that "the good wife"? What was it? A courtroom scene, I think. 
>> He just led him right into the trap. And that was very harmful to mitt romney because not only did it take benghazi off the table, it basically took foreign policy off the table. It made it seem like in the third debate, you know, that romney barely showed up because he had basically ceded all of foreign policy to the president. That's what the polls were showing. But also it's something that you very rarely see in a debate, chris, which is clean kill. You got lloyd benson doing it to dan quayle. Two or three other examples in the entire history of presidential debates. And this was -- this was a perfect one where romney was very well prepared on many other issues, was taken by his staff to a place that he shouldn't have been, where he is trying to score points on an issue where he shouldn't have been trying to score. 
>> Go ahead, ken. 
>> What made that so effective is he wasn't even the one that delivered the sort of kill line. It was candy crowley, the moderator of the debate, because what romney said, which is that obama did not use those words was so demonstrably false, the moderator stepped in and said you're wrong. And that was devastating. 
>> He is right, john. The next caused the internet to blow up. Twitter instantly went wild. It's the number two line of the year. Let's take a listen. 
>> We took a concerted effort to go out and find women who had backgrounds that could be qualified to become members of our cabinet. I went to a number of women's groups and said can you help us find folks. And they brought us whole binders full of women. 

[00:52:15]


>> What did they decide was the quote of the year? This probably won't shock you. In some ways it defined what the election is all about. Let's watch. 
>> There are 47% of the people who will vote for the president either way there are 47% who are with him who believe that they're victims, who believe that government has the responsibility to care for them. So my job is not to worry about those -- that they should take personal care and responsibility for their lives. 
>> Agree, john, agree, ken this was the line that put him away? 
>> Not only was this unbelievably divisive in a country that likes to think of itself as one country, but it was critically important that it was caught on surreptitious video. If this is something he had said in public, it would have been a big gaffe, but not as damaging as seeing it on that video where the voter is thinking ah-ha, now I'm seeing the real mitt romney, not one in the packaging. 
>> And not just that, the setting that he was speaking to wealthy donors who he could be candid with. It was like the true mitt romney talking to his people in this setting. It just so illustrative of what people's preconceptions, worst preconceptions of who mitt romney was. 
>> You know, a really good lawyer in washington, to make your point, told me the other day. The worst thing that can happen in a criminal trial is just to hear the voice of your client on tape there is something as you said about, john, caught on tape. Ever since nixon, I don't know what. You don't want to be caught on tape. 
>> Right, right. 
>> Anyway, thank you, john. Merry christmas, happy new year. When we return, let me finish with my thoughts on the year that was. You're watching "hardball," the PLACE FOR POLITICS.w?? 

[00:57:42]


>>> Let me end tonight and end the year with this. I said it was a year of two steps forward, one step backward. A reasonable judgment about america in 2012 is we are a more diverse people than some imagined. We're a country more tolerant of our diversity than I imagined. Was it a good year for america? My answer is yes. As a country, we backed the rights of women, increasingly backed those of guy people. We voted as a people who believe not just in life and liberty, but the pursuit of happiness. From a distance of 236 years, we were very loyal to the opening words of the declaration of independence. I never believed president barack obama had a second term in the bag. The night of his first debate with governor romney, I thought he was on his way out of town. But he wasn't. His vice president outbattled his rival. The president himself came back to show he was not a man to be taken down twice. Most important, he got some breaks. The supreme court upheld health care. The jobless rate dropped below 8%. Mitt romney showed himself a man at home with his fellow rich, out on a limb when trying to be someone he isn't, a right-wing simple on the. So we look for washed to a new year and a new second administration of a significantly progressive president. America isn't a hard right country, intolerant, resentful of its new countrymen and women. It is on balance a centrist company with central leanings. It likes its president. It roots for its success and believes strongly that america will win again because of its deep resilience. We can change. We are changing. And when we see failure, when we see heart, we're not afraid to change there is an old line in the movies, it may be my favorite. I learned that people are only truly pay attention to what they discover for themselves. In the morning hours of newtown, connecticut, in the horror of 20 young faces we learned what must be done because we saw what was being done to our children and grandchildren if we didn't. We gave up cigarettes, which gave us pleasure, because we discovered the damage they can do because of the horror they can do. We should be able to give up semiautomatic rifles. And that's "hardball" for now. Thanks for being with us. Have a very happy new year.

=======================================================

Caphart. 
>>> We can't tell our people to vote on abolishing slavery at the same time telling them you will negotiate for peace. 
>> You cannot have both. 
>> How many hundreds of thousands have died during your administration. 
>> Hundreds cannot declare equal. Those who got are created unequal. 
>> Leave the constitution alone. 
>> You're stepping on the world stage now with the fate of human dignity in our hands. Blood has been spilt and led to this moment. Now now now! 
>> Abraham lincoln has asked us to work with him to accomplish the death of slavery. 
>> No one's ever been loved so much. Don't waste that power. 
>> This fight is for the united states of america. 
>> We didn't choose to be born and do we fit into the times we're born into. 
>> I don't know about myself. You maybe. 
>>> Welcome back to the morning edit"morning joe." 
>> Enjoy your holidays? 
>> Great. 
>> Fantastic. 
>> Thank you for spending part of your morning with us. This hour, we're talking "lincoln." 
>> Wish they would leave. They came over. I never even met them. 
>> Do you know their names yet? 
>> I never even met them. Hey, neighbor. 
>> Hey, how are you? Good to see you. It's like, I don't know your name. I hate it when it happens. 
>> I will buy them all tickets to my favorite movie of the year, "lincoln," hand it to them online. Go in my door and lock it. This is a heck of a coincidence. The sn spielberg film based on doris win's book on how this president ended slavery. The film turned out to be the talk of the political world with special screenings for capitol hill, newspaper editorials come PAIRING THE 1860s TO TODAY AND Pundits expressing renewed respect for the art of the political deal. 

[00:02:24]


>> Academy award winning director and producer steven spielberg joined us in october along with managing editor, rick stingel, who devoted and entire article to "what would lincoln do" and the daunting task of becoming the 16th president. 
>> Dani day-lewis is an extraordinary actor as I'm sure you will agree. And the portrayal of a man I'm sure everyone would put ae top of all presidents. 
>> He understand people opposed to him and people supporting him. Had a deep deep kind of come mun ion with all the issues, he was widely criticized for, too slow to come to any decision, SLOW TO replace McClellan to general grant and all these things he came under great criticism for and all of a sudden, he is headstrong and hurling down the road of history to get this amendment that abolishes slavery through the house of representatives. In a sense, you see all sides of him. You also see the turmoil. We forget or reads the history books and forget there's turmoil inside the house and unions. This is a president that had to stare down enemies on all sides. 
>> The other thing he does, all these characteristics lincoln represent, patience, strategic delay, are things in our society now we would castigate a candidate for. You're slow to make decision, you change your mind all the time. Unfortunately aspects from both candidates, aspects candidates cannot do now because they would be criticized for having lack of leadership. 

[00:04:43]


>> The movie is based in part on doris kearns goodwin book about how lincoln was able to connect with everyday americans. The white house then was so much more open than it is today. People wanting government jobs would line up by the hundreds outside lincoln's office each with a story to tell, a reason his family needed a clerkship or job in a post office in order to survive. Lincoln's secretary, john nicolay and john hay told him he didn't have time for these ordinary people. You are wrong, he responded these are my public opinion baths. Their serve to renew in me a clearer and more vivid image of that great popular assemblage of which I have sprung. 
>> You say that everyday, willie. 
>> And I wonder the great political courage it was for him to do then. How difficult was that fight for him in 1863, 1864? >>What was difficult about the fight he did not run on the abolitionist ticket. He would not have won then. He had an urge from his very young years that slavery was an atrocity. At the very beginning when the war started, he could not let those border states secede and go south. He pretty much put on political theater meaning he said what had to be said to calm the border states down. Before the secession of the southern rebels, he tried very very harto p them from leaving by pretty much telling them anything they wanted to hear. In his heart, in the deepest reaches of abraham lincoln, he knew slavery had to be abolished at the beginning of his term. 

[00:06:43]


>> Was it a difficult decision zeroing in on one part of his life? 
>> A really hard decision because doris' book is brilliant. I read many books on lincoln and she was sending me chapters as far back as 2003, I had chapters sent to me. What was difficult was there's so many highlights for lincoln's presidency. For the movie audience -- a tv series would be one template. For the movie audience, I felt you had to see him wrestling with one crisis, and not just the civil war where so many were killed. But the crisis of abolishing slavery, which could extend the war longer if he did. And until the end of april to the end of his life. 
>> Lincoln seems like thomas jeffemadison, sons of elite. Lincoln seems like the rest of us. He seems a guy that struggles, a guy that loses more elections than he wins and a guy that gets down on the ground with his son and unlike george washington, this regular man that struggles with things so many of us struggle with, one of the great presidents. 
>> One of the great presidents. Not the greatest looking are president in our history. Because the camera wasn't around, it made it a little bit easier to get him elected. 
>> Here's what "time" magazine editor at large, a lincoln expert himself writes in the latest issue as well, lincoln understood even in times of extreme polarization, the moderate center is the path to presidential success, was then and is now even as he felt his way on the tightrop lincoln kept his eyes on the public on the shore beyond. Americans have always been a future oriented people and our most admire presidents have been the ones who painted tomorrow in bright colors no matter how grim today. Franklin d. Roosevelt, john f. Kennedy, ronald reagan all heirs to abraham lincoln. 

[00:09:14]


>> And saying 1652 is the most pivotal time in american history and told a crowd this french tightrope walker who walked across niagara. Say you had on your back, the entire history of america, future of the america, go faster, go slower, he was saying, abraham lincoln, I have all this on my back in the most treacherous circumstance and everybody is telling me what to do. 
>> One of the most remarkable things, even after the bar that caused him so much, a it was winding down, he was the man that was telling the north, with malice toward none, chairty for all, he understand even after this terrible war, he was going to have to bring the country back together. 
>> Exactly. He sadly for us, didn't survive his term and couldn't begin let alone complete the reconstruction. 
>> We just saw, rick, obviously three idential debates and one vice-presidential debate. It seems, you know, the president had a terrible time the first debate, and the third debate, it seemed like mitt romney was sitting there and trying to remember what had been put in his head. They both seemed uncomfortable at times. You go back to lincoln's day and, you know, stephen douglas and abraham lincoln debates, the guys would stand up and h long -- 
>> I thinkhree hours. 
>> On and on. It is amazing what -- 
>> lincoln, you see a little bit of this in the movie because it was an era you could make gaffes also. The longer lincoln was in office the shorter his speeches became because he didn't want to give people an opportunity to pick at things he said. The get tis berg address lasted a minute and a half and and the speech before lasted 2 1/2 hours. The other thing the movie does in the context of this election, you realize lincoln is a practical politician. Yes, he's idealistic, also a realist in getting things done. In the passage of the 13th amendment, lincoln was writing down votes, how do we get the congressman from ohio and the congressman from indiana, interesting to see. 

[00:11:53]


>> A little lbj. Doris, one of my favorite lines doris says about lincoln says this promoting the book, yes, lincoln was a great man but lincoln was also a good man. 
>> We have a lot of great leaders whoaren't good men and lincoln was the exception there. 
>> He had a core of decency and ecquinimity. You have to understand he was cut off, had many opponents outside his own party. To get anything done took literally an act of congress. He had to twist some arms to get that done. If he had had a 24-7 news cycle like we have today. He would have never -- riots in the north and was so patient and with that patience finally reward. 
>> When did you finally decide to do this? How many chapters from doris before you said I have to put this up on the screen? 
>> I produced a segment of the millennial celebration for the clinton white house. During that time I convened a think tank including steven ambrose and burns and invited doris and she told me she was writing a book about lincoln's presidency. At that moment, I said, are the film rights available? That day, I said are they available? I always wanted to do something on lincoln but not until I knew doris was the one to put it down on paper I threw my hat into the ring at that point. 
>> "Saving private ryan" defined world war ii for people who didn't live through it. This moment will define lincoln and the 13th amendment. What's your next project? 

[00:13:54]


>> I hope lincoln never stops knockaround in my head, and don't want to take the film coat off. I am getting back into science fiction. Not a reaction to history. This has been a deep passion for me. Now that it's almost ready to come out, my next film this is complete opposite of this in terms of tone and genre. 
>> What do you watch when you're at home? Have a favorite series? Watch "homeland?" 
>> I watch "homeland" my wife and I are watching it every sunday night. And the same way we watched "24." I'm a news junky. 
>> "Homeland". 
>> "Modern family." I like "revolution some. 
>> Band of brothers. Talking about "private ryan" led to "band of brothers" and written several years ago, i thought was fascinating, when we were growing up, you go to school and sit around the office and talk about the great movies. Now, it's more, did you see what happened last night, could you believe what happened with brodie last night. It did all start with "band of brothers" in 2001? 
>> "Band of brothers," that was e first time we took the steven ambrose book and did research on that and laid out 10 hours to honor the veterans, especially -- you know -- to me, that was interesting. Television goes way back. I remember my dad used to repair television sets when I was a little kid, for money. I guess we were one of the first people on our block to have a television set in the early '50s. I know the same thing happened then that happens now. If there was a funny sid caesar skit, that was the conversation at the cooler. That was the conversation. Television has always had that draw. Television hurt movies 60 years ago, the first time movies had a rival. Now, there's a very interesting balance between television watching and movie going. 

[00:16:27]


>> The thank steven spielberg for joining us. When we come back, our discussion continues on the woman who wrote the book on which the movie was based. You're watching "morning joe" brewed by starbucks. hudson. I hate getting up in the morning. I love bread. I love cheese. Did I say I love chocolate? I'm human! And the new weight watchers 360 program lets me be. The reason I'm still in this body feelin' so good isn't because I never go out and enjoy the extra large, extra cheese world we live in. It's because I do. And you can too. Because when a weight loss program is built for human nature you can expect amazing. Introducing the new weight watchers 360 program. Join for free and expect amazing. Because it works. from Is bigger than we think ... like the flu. With aches, fever and chills- the flu's a really big deal. So why treat it like it's a little cold?

[00:19:44]


>>> We'll win the war, sir. It's inevitable, isn't it? 
>> It ain't won yet. 
>> You'll be getting your second term with a semidivine stature. Imagine the possibilities peaceful and great. Why tarnish your luster in the house. The same gang of talentless hicks and hacks who rejected the amendment ten months ago will lose. 
>> I like our chances now. 
>> Welcome back to "morning joe." Joining us from boston is the woman behind the movie "lincoln," presidential historian, doearns goodwin. Doris, good to have you with us this morning. 
>> Glad to be with you. 
>> We're talking about obviously lessons from the past year. Tell us what steven spielberg's movie, inspired by your book, inspired by abraham lincoln, teaches us in the aftermath of this election and in the middle of some pretty damned difficult debates over our financial future and how to best protect our children. 
>> I think the most important thing, it teaches us about presidential leadersp and about what politics can do to make life better for people. We have such a cynical view right now of our politicians. What "lincoln" shows and the movie reveals, in the hands of a person like abraham lincoln, he was a man, not an icon, it's possible to have deep profound convictions which he did. He was willing to go to war to save the union, willing to screw up potentially the political capital of a second term to get that amendment passed and he was willing to compromise to do whatever was necessary to reach the goals he told about. He told stories to communicate and talked to people coming in and out of the white house and never lost his connection to that popular assemblage from which he had come. It leads us to believe politics is a noble profession and the right people can make the right choices even though we've lost a lot of faith in it right now. 

[00:21:56]


>> Doris, a few days ago, when the president spoke in newtown high school, in the wake of his speech, because we've become a nation of 300 million social commentators with twitter and everything, there was an astounding number of people who were critical of the president for never mentioning or using the word "gun" in those remarks that sunday ening at the high school. And yet the gettysburg address, president lincoln never used any word "slavery," yet the power of the presidency, are there similar lines do you think what lincoln did with his words an what president obama seems to be doing or on the verge of doing with his words? 
>> I think you're so right, mike. In a certain sense I was thinking about that. Think about what abraham lincoln said at the gettysburg address, a similar kind of move, no loss express what we feel as we are dedicating this cetery to soldiers who died and we the living have to make their lives worthwhile. I don't think he had tgo into specifics, I have a lot of power. I will used that power. And like lincoln said, I'm clothed with this 13th amendment power and then you follow up with what you do about video games and gun control and the internet. I think the tone of it was absolutely pitch perfect. 
>> Doris, john heilemann. One of the things most amazing about the movie, the way in which it kind of celebrates the kind of darker side of politics, right? It shows you this isn't just about nobility, there'slot of horse trading to get things done. If you were sitting in the oval office, I know you have done that with president obama, what would you tell him to conduct himself in the whole range of things xt term to get things done. 

[00:24:18]


>> He has to keep that close connection. Lincoln had people coming to his office every morning. And they said, you don't need to spend time with these people. He said, you are wrong. You get a mastery of timing when you have the sentiment of the country behind you. That's one of the lessons. The other is not to be embarrassed making deals. During the health care thing every deal got exposed and looks like it was a terrible thing. It's the end result that matters as long as nothing illegal was done. 
>> Doris, you just referenced, for my money, is one of the most powerful scenes in the movie for lincoln, daniel day-lewis exhibiting great anger and indicating he is clothes in immense powers as president. In watching the movie and thinking about the speech the president made at newtown high school, despite all the advance, incredible advances we have today, we have public people who are reluctant understandable, to express similar anger over outrageous things. It's interesting to me had the president of the united states today expressed such visible anger as daniel day-lewis did portraying lincoln, I wonder what the reaction would be? 
>> Interesting, those words some of the most famous words in the movie are actually abraham lincoln's words. I am clothed with immense power and you will get this passed. I think it was well inside him. You had a feeling president obama was reaching almost to that point. I still think at that memorial service, it wasn't the night for anger, the night for con sulation. But anger should probably come forward for public officials in weeks ahead. There's room for it in public life because it also moneylizes people as sorrow and good words do. 

[00:26:24]


>> No doubt about it. There's nothing wrong with and nothing more powerful than righteous anger when used at appropriate times. I would say certainly in a movie used at an appropriate time as it was in lincoln's life. If this is not the appropriate time for politicians to be righteous in their anger at the state of things, I don't know when is. If not now when? 
>> Doris kearns goodwin, thank you so much. You will also be in our next segment. 
>> That's exciting. 
>> A videotape. 
>>> And doris and jon meacham and the civil war in pennsylvania. Next on "morning j." 
>> Announcer: Did you know there are secret black market websites around the world that sell stolen identities? 30-year-old american man, excellent credit rating.

[00:31:11]


>>> America is in the midst of commemoration of the anniversary of the civil war. And consider the battle gettysburg. And with us to talk about it. Mike barnicle, he was there and pulitzer winning historian jon meacham. By the way, he was cheering for lee. Best selling author, doris earns good win. Let's begin with you, jon, why did gettysburg matter so much? 
>> It turned lee's army back and ended the invasion of the north and was the turning point of the war. At that point, though it was going to be difficult and bloody in the wilderness campaign and many many lives would be lost, in an historical perspective, that was the beginning of the end, as churchill might say, of the war. My sense, too, it resonates not only because of what happened there military in '63, but because of the words spoken there, what abraham lincoln did at that battlefield was to redefine the country, rededicate it, as he put it, jeffersonian principle. When we look back on the civil war, it's fascinating to me that so much of our understanding of what it meant came from 1863, not from 1861. 
>> Mike, you go to gettysburg and you see that line that marks the south's deep's advance to the north. I have to say as a southerner that grew up, it's hard to imagine lee's army's ever got that deep into the union. 
>> Yeah. Picket's charge up cemetery hill, I think you're talking about that. I agree with what jon said about gettysburg. Another caveat important about gettysburg. In our frame of reference talking about war, most americans, many americans are not going to go to normandy, they're not going to see the bulge, they're not going to visit the battles of the pacific. You can go to gettysburg and stand there on a hot july day and heat and countryside, you can still sense the cost of war. It's critical and learn a little bit about the history of the cost of war important for all americans and american presidents to understand. Picket's charge was basically a suicidal run up the side of cemetery ridge. 

[00:34:02]


>> You stand there, you go to so many battle fields, there's no way to recreate it, you stand at the top and look down at picket's charge and just gasp. 
>> You look down and you can en12 to 13,000 confederate soldiers rushing up that hill in the incredible velocity of the union artillery. You can understand by general long street disagreed with general lee about doing this, about the tactics involved. You can certainly understand during july 3rd and july 4th, took the day off to honor the day. General lee urges general picket to invigorate his division and go back at it. General pickett says to general lee, general, I have no more division, they were decimated. 
>> None of us military historians ss this is pure speculation, I think most that have studied general lee and what he was able to do with the troops he had, leading up to gettysburg, would say he was perhaps the greatest general america has ever produced. Do you think even this great general, this humble man, by all estimation, this remarkable character by all estimations just started to believe his press clippings? Started to believe he had done so much on the way up to pennsylvania that even he could do the impossible? 
>> You almost have to believe that, when you've come that far with those men you can't stop. You know what stopping is going to mean. The extraordinary thing with this great general lee is to imagine what would have happened when abraham lincoln offered him the head of the union army if he had loved america more than his state. But the state meant more obviously. What's interesting, we all say now that gettysburg was the high water mark. Indeed, looking back on it, it is. For those living at the time, for lincoln, the victory at gettysburg produced one of his worst moments of depression afterwards, because he was constantly telegraming general lee, you have to get this army, don't let them escape. It will be over in a matter of months and if they escape it will go on year after year. In his depression he wrote a letter to general meade. I'm immeasurably distressed, you didn't do what we asked you. Had you done so, this war would come to an earlier end. Knowing it would paralyze the general, he's still in the field and it hurt him, he put it aside and never seen when lincoln's papers are opened and it said never sent and never signed. It's a great thing, write the letter, put the letter aside, cool down psychologically and never send it. 

[00:37:08]


>> I have to write that down, don't send those. You don't hit return. 
>> Harder for the e-mail. 
>> That is a problem with e-mail. 
>> Joe, you raise, I think, among historians, among just people who are taken with what happened at gettysburg, one of the more intriguing questions of american history. It is about lee. Why did he perceive -- why did he proceed with that tragedy? By the time pickett's charge had finished, don't hold me to the numbers, 25 of 40 of his commanders had been killed at gettysburg? 25 out of 40. His army leadership had been decimated. Lee wrote, to my knowledge, no real memoir of that war. So we don't know, we don't know why he didit. 
>> But he knew, by the end of that day what he had done. 
>> Let's talk about the speech. Doris, what is it about that sspeech that actually was panned in the papers that week in realtime, it was panned. What is it about the gettysburg address that you memorized when you were in third or fourth grade. I memorized when I was in third or fourth grade. Our great grandchildren will be memorizing? 
>> Because it provided a meaning for this terrible war. It went back to the great declaration of independent tense. The constitution prevented us from doing anything about slavery in the south and finally he reaches back to the ideals of the declaration of independence and gives a meaning of the war and soldiers that died that will last forever, even though it was only two minutes. Two minute speech afverett edward spoke for two hours. They didn't even know he was done so there wasn't this great moment of understanding, soon literary figures soon understand the glory of it. All the shakespeare, drama, bible he had memorized as a child he had loved scouring the countryside worked his way into his soul and that peach, it will last forever. 

[00:39:34]


>> If you reread the speech, we all ought to reread it regularly. He talks basically about the spine of the republic. He talks about this nation, this republic will go forward and survive and out-last this. You think about the context of history, there is the gettysburg address, there is perhaps we have nothing to fear but fear itself from franklin roosevelt. We have ask not what you can do for your country from john f. Kennedy. How many other presidents have stood and spoken and had their woelled in our mental memory, talking about 1 years. 
>> For a man that wanted to be remembered as lincoln did, thinking that can be the only way you can live on in existence, he certainly got that wish with that terrible childhood, laboring against education and in our minds forever. 
>> Doris, thank you very much. 
>>> Coming up next, spielberg's film wasn't the only this year, and vampire hunter. Joining us next to shed light on lincoln's lesser known side, one spielberg overlooked and we'll look at the facts from doris. Stick around. ring... Progresso This reduced sodium soup says it may help lower cholesterol, how does it work? You just have to eat it as part of your heart healthy diet. Step 1. Eat the soup. All those veggies and beans, that's what may help lower your cholesterol and -- Well that's easy 

[00:41:46]


[ Male Announcer ] Progresso. You gotta taste this soup. 80 miles from here to gettysburg and 80 miles to decide whether this nation belongs to the living or the dead. 

[00:44:32]


>> We got to keep them away from the lomotive. 
>> That was a scene from the movie am lincoln vampire hunter" where the 16th president of the united states takes on a new role. One of the film stars anthony mackie talks about why the movie "vampires" is the perfect date movie. 
>> I was just saying it'u the perfect date movie, you take a beautiful young lady, give her popcorn and icy. She's sitting there when it comes on and she'll go argh! It's okay, baby, it's okay. I'll fight those big vampires for you. 
>> Oh, my. All right. 
>> Anthony, a lot of people saw the title of this movie and they were wracking their brains going through their junior year in high school history. I remember abraham lincoln but the part about the vampire hunting, I must have missed that. 
>> If you can get past the title and allow yourse to believe there's a guy from another planet who goes around in a phone boothe and tight suit that saves the planet. You can believe abraham lincoln was a superman. Abraham lincoln was the greatest ofll of them. 
>> How do you combine history with fantasy. 
>> It's called movies. 
>> I get that, anthony. 

[00:46:33]


>> The first book was "prejudice and zombies" at barnes & noble. That's not a plug for them. He sees a biography of abraham lincoln and said, why didn't anybody write this book before. He went home with a recontextualization and for women to go argh and the man, it's okay. 
>> I will do a fact check. Presidential historian, world renowned presidential historian author of "team of rivals," doris concerns goodwin on the phone. Doris kearns goodwin, was abraham lincoln. 
>> I can shut it down. You've gone through the national archives and seen all the papers. Was he a vampire? 
>> It's pretty embarrassing this man I went to bed with every morning and where was this part? I didn't know about it. 
>> This book was amazing reading more about his politics in the white house opposed to his personal life. If you go into his personal life, you will learn there were many intricate ideas what he did with his night life. 
>> See that. 
>> Thought I didn't read the book. I told you I read the book. 
>> The interesting thing is the same starting point for the book in the movie is real with his mother's death when he was 9. What historians know is it had such an effect on him he needed to do something, saying I will dye now and never return and said there was nothing left. He eventually got consolation in the thought if I can do something that deals with time, I'll live on in the memory of others. 

[00:48:39]


>> He lost three children, not one, correct? 
>> Correct. 
>> In the movie, we had him losing a son. Abraham lincoln saw so much death, losing his mother and three kids and mary todd looked at as bipolar before bipolar was diagnosed. You see that in the film and how his life was affected by outside factors and we decided to make the outside factors vampires. 
>> The movie stretches reality a little bit. You don't actually play abraham lincoln? 
>> Yes, I do, modern technology and cgi, I play bro lincoln. 
>> You actually play his political consultant. Like the james carville. 
>> I'm the robin to his batman. 
>> William johnson was actually abraham lincoln's chauffeur. 
>> He's a real guy. 
>> He was with abraham lincoln giving the gettysburg address and he died of smallpox and abraham lincoln with his own money had him buried he had written "william h. Johnson, citizen," and I think it was remarkable. He didn't call him caddie or employee, he didn't call him man, he called him citizen -- 
>> or vampire caddie. 
>> Or vampire slapper in the facer.

=======================================================

>>> Good morning. Welcome to "morning joe." We thank you for spending the morning with us. Hope everyone is having a wonderful holiday. 
>> I am. 
>> Are you having a wonderful holiday? 
>> I love it! I have my 4-year-old jack over there reading the must read pages. Little kate somewhere in the back. 
>> She's rolling prompter. 
>> Actually, I will have her take my barbells to the second floor. I have them here because i exercise. 
>> And there's joe somewhere. Having a great holiday season. 
>> We're taking a look back at the stories that shaped 2012. Joining us on set is msnbc contributor, mike barnicle. Hole low, mike. 
>> Hello, mika. 
>> Glad you're awake. 
>> Msnbc political analyst, john heilemann. 
>> Hi. 
>> And co-host of c squawkbox, andrew sorkin. 
>> Do I need to make a joke about yesterday? 
>> You've grown up. 
>> From washington, we have nbc chief foreign affairs correspondent andrea mitchell reports. 
>> Happy holidays, everyone. 
>> "Washington post" columnist, msnbc contributor. Thank you so much for being with us, jonathan. 
>>> Why don't we start with the story of the year, barack obama wins, republicans lose in a way that perhaps is more telling than just what one election result might suggest. 
>> Well, I think it certainly does. It difference him a certain platform and credibility perhaps he didn't have before. Watching as these fiscal cliff negotiations have gone through the holidays, it certainly is more perhaps a little bit more bully pulpit for the president and his position on taxes. The biggest story of the year came at the end of the year in the pa week or so, the massacred sandy hook elementary in newtown and I think the presidency now might be shaped by those events. Those are the stories barnicle and andrea have chosen as the top stories of 2012 to cover. 

[00:02:37]


>> Mike barnicle, would you agree this could be a signature of a second term. 
>> I do agree with that. I think the events a few days ago of newtown in connecticut will help shape the president's second term in office and gives us huge impetus of change in this country that have taken too long to take hold. I think to the presidency himself and man himself was shaped and altered by these events as a parent and president. 
>> Let me sahas written about the action has said what was written about rfk was done. He said we have to act within ten days beforehe nra gets organized. He failed to do it andologic had 
-- and lbj had a bill bottled up in the committee and it went through with much less in october and the president spoke angrily about the failure to do something to defeat the gun lobby. While I have a spirit of the season and feeling things have changed and saw joe's powerful statement in the immediate aftermath of the killings, i have my doubts whether this president and this congress have the guts and strength and political courage to go forward. 
>> They have to move quickly, don't they? 
>> I think they do. You can't lose them. The sense of moral urgency that comes with proximity to this thing. Right now, the nra is on its heels. The defenders of per miss gun laws are in a defensive crouch right now and the time you want to capitalize on that. The only time. You don't want to let any sense of complacency step back and allow the forces time to regroup and bolster their efforts. They will exist. This will not be an easy thing to get done. 

[00:05:08]


>> Mika, we talked about this happening in shopping malls in other gone and movie theaters in colorado, college campuses in virginia. Finally a first grade class in connecticut, in a state that has tougher gun laws in several other states in a community that looked like it should be so shielded from this in a season it's supposed to be about peace. I think it underlined in so many ways why none of us are shielded from this kind of violence unless we force our leaders to do something. 
>> Again, I worry about what andrea mitchell is saying about the concern whether the president and congress has the guts to do something. I would say it would be one of the most disappointing things i have ever witnessed in my entire lifetime if we can't make fundamental changes in our gun laws and not only that, how we handle mental illness in this country and school security and ervasive and deadly culture of these violent video games, i don't care, I'll say it, feed into this, almost every profile we see and literally give these young male shooters guideposts as to how to commit a mass murder, a massacre and they literally sit for hours learning how to do it and enjoying it and then you wonder why it actually happens sometimes. 
>> Children already desensitized. Andrea mentioned the statement i made right after these terrible killings. There are some people, are you really going toame -- 
>> yes, I am. 
>> I remember when my two older boys had video games and it made the progression and they bring home james bond and running around seems like every other video game and then get to a point somebody raises a gun and pulls the trigger. I remember being so horrified 10 years ago I jumped out of my seat, what the hell is that? Ran across, grabbed the video game out, threw it away. A couple christmases ago, they bring home one of these war games, we're just sitting there watching them as they shoot 20, 30, 40 people in a two, three minute time period. It happens, you isolate these kids and sit in their room and do this. 

[00:07:57]


>> For hours. 
>> Hours and hours at a time. Combine that with mental health problems with a pervasive gun culture, like the one this boy had in his house, tragedy follows. 
>> Even the 30 second commercials for some of the video games are horrific. I understand where andrea is coming from. I certainly understand the cynicism. We've all lived through these events in the past where nothing has happened. I think we have reason for hope with this terrible terrible thing that happened in newtown, connecticut. It is this. Diminishment with anything that happened in aurora or virginia tech or any place in this country. This event that happened in newtown, connecticut, is much easier to access on an emotional level for huge numbers of people in this country because of the ages of the victims. 6 and 7 years of age. All of us with children have memories of children 6 and 7 and you can access immediately at an emotional level the deaths of these children. That's why there's strength in what the president said and will be lingering anger at the president nothing's been done and all the elements ah eve spoken about. 
>> The video games so violent wen we were kids, definitely us, maybe you, too. You had a lonely socially disfunctional child that was maybe an outcast. Chances are he'd watch too much television and maybe he'd see "starsky & hutch" too much or something else. You know what they do now? They sit in front of the computer and watch people die by their own hand in these games. It's absolutely ludicrous this can happen and we don't make a direct link because that's what these young boys, lonely troubled, sometimes medicated boys. I'll say it. They have all deficit versions of mental illness and personality disorders. These profiles are the same and they're all doing it. It is connected. 

[00:10:15]


>> It is. Jonathan, the problem is, when you talk about it, you talk about violence in hollywood movies or video games, you'll have people on the left saying, you're just trying to show the nra -- then, when you go after the nra, you will have people saying, you're not looking at mental health. Everybody creates a false choice. If you talk about violence on americans and somehow not talking about guns and if you talk about guns, you're not taking a strong stand on mental health and everybody avoids the issues and not getting anything done. 
>> Everyone is using the argument as diversions from dealing with the issues at hand. None of these things have been in isolation. I'm glad you're having this conversation because one thing be gets the other. If people don't think violent video games has something to do with this or mental illness has something to do with this and growing isolation of yng boys or young people has anything to do with this, they're crazy. The other thing is we talk about what the president has done or hasn't done on gun issues, whether this will give the president the bully pulpit moment to do something on this. Yes, we should focus on the president, he I the president and chief competitive. We need to take a look at what's going on to push back against nra. Mayor bloomberg is doing his part with his pushback against +ns and pack. And he's going against it in a way only mike bloomberg can because he's a billionaire, and gives him the money to go against the nra others don't have and the independence to tell the nra to stuff it. If you have the president pushing and mayor bloomberg pushing, we should give our congress the courage to say we're not listening to you, this time we're going to do something. >>Heilemann? 

[00:12:49]


>> I think that's all true. The president has the loudest voice, only one voice. It's the largest voice. The truth is, as people pointed out, in his first term did not dedicate a lot of political capital in the wake of other shootings and not really done much about this. I do think president obama heading into a second term, now, what he's playing for is his legacy. The things he accomplishes over the next four years are legacy matters. He cares about that enthusiasmly. He said it now in the speech he gave sunday night after the massacre, I will use all the power available to me in this office to keep this from happening again. He expects to be held to that, should be held to that. Hard to lay down a marker and walk away from that. 
>> Andrew sorkin, one big difference today after aurora or oregon and these other shootings. He's had four mass shootings sincected president. He's been re-elected and lots of people see it as a lame duck presidency. But he's had more power as we've seen in budget negotiations. 
>> My worry, and I second everything said around the table. My worry, I think andrew is worried, you really have to get out of your shell and have courage to take this on. Are we talking about bringing back the laws from 1994 or are we going further? Are people willing to go further and frankly, I think we should go further. And health issues, is that really on the table. You mentioned video games. I agree with you. Having said that, you can see the first amendment arguments will be there and lobbying on all these issues. My great fear is maybe we do go back to the laws of 1994. I'm not sure in this day and age when you add up to other issues, when it comes to video games and health issues we get there. One is there's a technoloical solution I keep hearing more and more about we should force gun makers to have electronic fingerprints on the guns to individuals, if we're going to have them out there at all, not talking about semi-automatics, straight handguns. The second issue is in this world we live in. I was just at the airport, we spend billions of dollars with the tsa to avoid one shoe bomber. To avoid one person with mental health issues. As much as I want to focus on mental health issues, I think the guns ultimately are it. 

[00:15:54]


>> You look at the fact we have allowed the federal government to be intrusive every time we get on the plane. We have allowed our 9-year-old children to be stopped and frisked. Our grandmothers to be stopped and frisked. All these people that are our loved ones, every time we go through a tsa screening. We're willing to do that because of the attacks of 9/11 but we're not willing to tell a small niche of gun enthusiasts they can't carry around semi-automatic combat style weapons with these magazine clips that allow you to reel off 10, 15, 30 bullets per second that spin and rip young children to shreds. Really? Really? I don't think so.

[00:20:16]


>>> Welcome back to "morning joe." We want to continue our conversation on stories that shaped the past week even though even of the past week or so seemed to overshadow everything. Why don't we start with john heilemann's choice with a certain statement made at a certain funds razor. 
>> Before I mention mitt romney's 47% comment. I want to go over something i said earlier. It's easy to lose the forest for the trees. President obama won, not in a race that was said to be razor thin and super close, he wins 52% of the votes one of only five presidents who won 51% in two elections. 
>> Not even close when it comes to the swing states. At the end of the day, it wasn't close. An historic big victory for him and one that pore tends a lot for the future of american politics with the coalition of who elected him. Latinos, women. Asians. African-americans and there's probably no single moment of mitt romney's loss and no more single moment than the 47% video. He had been painted by his own words and president obama's team as a heartless out of to plutocrat. That image stuck to him -- 
>> I hate to interrupt. The article of the year and i hate to say it since you are here, we all have -- you had the article in the may magazine and talked to obama's people and said, basically, we can't win on our record so we have to destroy mitt romney and tear him apart. This is how we're going to do it and they did exactly what they told you back in may what they were going to do. 

[00:22:25]


>> They did. 
>> Did one from mitt romney's campaign get a subscription to "new york" magazine. 
>> It was like what they said on bain and take him out on his taxes and more important paint him as a figure of the past. It adds up to, someone who doesn't understand your problems from a bygone american who doesn't have anything to say to the voters who will make up our winning margin. To wrap that around the 47%. All that damage had been done by how the obama team painted him. Then mitt romney came out -- 
>> then mitt romney talked. 
>> With his own words, revealed in september, seemingly and vividly and confirming his own words and mouth caught on videotap caricatures -- 
>> at 47%, we fus on that. We forget this is a guy -- katel greatest hits for democratic ad makers. I like firing people. Won a big victory in florida and the next morning go on a cable news show and say something equally shocking. I'm not concerned about the very poor. 
>> For me, the 47% video was so -- it was shocking in its brutal honesty, but also how he was able ery half the country. I don't have to worry about those folks, those folks are freeloaders, looking for a handout, they don't know personal responsibility. These are the people he, one, hopes to lead, and, two, you would think he would want their votes. The next day, he doubled down on that and then a week later tried to pull it back. So for the american people to see someone to be president of the united states insult them, that was the one thing that put the lid on -- 

[00:24:37]


>> probably not a good marketing strategy hey, coke ads life, but in this case, we'd rather you die. People aren't going to buy coke. 
>> Andrew ross sorkin wants in. 
>>> Think the bigger issue this framed up and why it's so important, not just this past year but going into this next year, it reframed the inequality story in this country. We talk about makers and takers. To me, the 47% in many ways reflected what the occupy wall street folks talked about when they talked about we are the 99%. Hopefully, I hope that issue of romney's t as short as it was, reignited in this country the kind of jobs we want and raised issues about unions. It's much more than a political sentence and taken on all sorts of other meanings that has changed the debate and already changed the debate as we go into the new year 
>> what's interesting the president won, know doubt about it, he won handily. You look at the one big event a lot of us thought might be the defining moment, it was the first debate in denver where the president of the united states decided to not show up. 
>> It was profoly important at the time and showed a lack of engagement and particular and personal to barack obama. If you look at the polling data. I went to briefings as you did as well with the people who do the polling for the presides at the campaign, it moved the needle one point. They knew going back to the 47 % argument, they knew from months and months ago because of changes in demographic population changes they had so much going for them, they were never within 4 or 5 points of losing this campaign. The only dip they saw actually was after denver. They knew because of increasing hispanic and women and other minority involvement, the 47% was not going to lose because they simply had a majority. It has a profound impact on so many social issues we can discuss. 

[00:27:04]


>> Among other top stories of 2012 you chose, you chose along with mike barnicle, of all people as a smart point as well as andrew ross sorkin. Superstorm sandy climate change. 
>> That made that an impact on the last week of the election as well. 
>> I think so, joe. What happened after sandy, during sandy, to the lives of so many people on long island and new jersey, elsewhere, in an odd way is tied into the topic of 47% remark mitt romney made. A campaign -- in my memory, i can't recall a campaign so staggengly incompetent at the level of responding to things. Months went by and before it was released, the 47% comment was released, I can't get over the fact the campaign was so in competent they ran for months without any knowledge or attachment to the emotional lives of voters. What happened with bain and attacks on bain and thus on romney is that people make links, emotional link, bain, they took the factory and someone else took my house. Other forces are taking my children's futures. When sandy occurs, that's part of it, you know, my house is gone. Part of my life is gone. 
>> You're right. 
>> The emotional lives of voters they completely missed. 
>> Did they run this in a glue factory where the fumes -- 
>> he's a management consultant. What did he ever manage or consult on. 
>> You have this democratic super pac doing ads of workers hurt by bain. The romney campaign's response to that was not to go and find other workers who would attest to bain's management, talked to CEOs WHO TALKED ABOUT HOW ROMNEY Was a great guy. You can't imagine a worse response to that criticism.

>>> Coming up in our next hour, pulitzer prize winner doris kearns good win based on her book "lincoln." And the must read opinion pages. You're watching "morning j." I've always had to keep my eye on her... But, I didn't always watch out for myself. With so much noise about health care... I tuned it all out. With UnitedHealthcare, I get information that matters... My individual health profile. Not random statistics. They even reward me for addressing my health risks. So I'm doing fine... but she's still going to give me a heart attack. We're more than 78,000 people looking out for more than 70 million Americans. That's health in numbers. UnitedHealthcare. from Is bigger than we think ... like the flu. With aches, fever and chills- the flu's a really big deal. So why treat it like it's a little cold?

>>> Welcome back to "morning joe." Each morning on the show, we discuss some of the best opinion pieces of the morning. Today, I'm going to resurrect some of the strongest ones from the past year that sparked discussions on our show. 
>> Fantastic. 
>> I will speak about the last one that went to print, that is the "new york post" of all papers, the sandy hook horror, taking a stand on guns. 
>> The conservative "new york post." 
>> We know that guns don't kill, people do. We also know it's extremely difficult to justify the presence of high volume of fire military style weaponry in modern society. Yes, those who would disarm america must contend with the constitution. Now, those who defend the second amendment have to do so in the context of the sandy hook slaughter. As a matter of conscious, it's going to be a very tough case to make. I thought that was incredibly brave. 
>> It's a stunner. It really is a stunner and jonathan, and rupert murdoch own s several publications and his own network and he got out early with statements saying, what are we doing here? Being shocked by the carnage, i wonder if that will have an impact across other -- his other publications and news stations. 
>> Joe, for you to take the strong stance you've taken, if we're going to have any movement here, the advocates who want some sort of regulation on firearms are going to need to be joined by folks at the "new york post," folks like joe scarborougconservatives who can guide the conversation in a way, yes, it protects the right to bear arms. But as you said earlier, no right is absolute. If we're going to get to a place where we can all live in safety, democrats and republicans, liberals and conservatives, progressives all have to come together and do it together. 

[00:39:19]


>> Guys like joe manchin, who not only have spent their careers vilifying the nra and believing in the nra, believing in the second amendment right of people to keep and bear arms, but understand the laws have changed and facts have changed and we better find a way to deal with it. 
>> And people have changed. Rupert murdoch one of the greatest examples. As you indicated, he began tweeting within hours after the sandy hook school shootings and the new york editorial. We have fox news. Rupert murdoch has a history and knowledge of what happens with guns and assault weapons. In england in 1986, 16 school children were shot and killed. Within two years, parliament had passed maybe the world's most stringent gun legislation. 
>> The ban. 
>> Yes. That is still existent in london today. Murdoch is intimately familiar with this. He could be a powerful voice with this. 
>> Gun laws passed in australia after a tight legislation there, a gun culture like in america, has always beenrtable with guns. They passed some tough measures on some assault weapons. What a big difference it's made through the years. 
>> Murdoch is an important figure for years. We talked about the president's need to lead on this. It's real. He needs to lead. At the same time, for legislationo get passed, conservative democrats in rural pro gun districts around the country. You have to look at people like rupert murdoch, does that position carry over to the fox news. It's easier for the "new york post" in liberal manhattan and the rest of the country. Does fox news start to move? That's an important thing. Doses orrin hatch saying he will not run for re-election in 2018, is he going to be a republican in the past worked with gun control advocates, will he be a leader on the republican side? Those are the people to watch over the next few months. 

[00:41:56]


>>> I'll go to the last one. Go to this one, sparked a great conversation and turned out to be true, as usual, quite frankly, of your analysis of the republican party. No. It's not fun. I don't think this is fun for you. Crazy never wins by joe scarborough in "politico." By that standard, it is in short supply a using the standard my father used, it's not hard to pick out the pretenders in this year's field. Guys like my dad do not gamble on candidates like michele bachmann or newt gingrich and guys like my dad tune out politicians who compare opponents to joseph stalin or adolph hitler and guys like my dad don't cozy up to texas governors who brag about seceding from the union or call social security unconstitutional. 
>> The nominee wasn't willing to stand up to crazy. Early on, there were so many time, he could have just turned, mike barnicle, to michele bachmann, who said something outrageous and go, wait a second. I'm a conservative. Are you kidding me? Or to herman cain or when sarah palin was running around calling barack obama a socialist, bordering on a communist and all these other things that were going on. Crazy never wins but we learned another thing. You better stand up to crazy if you want to win in bucks county, pennsylvania, if you want to win in the i-4 corridor or win in the suburbs of ohio and if you want to win in the place where elections are actually won! 
>> You know, I would ask you, john heilemann, as a keen observer of the electoral scene was not the dye cast for mitt romney and perhaps the rest of the year in terms of republican politics on the evening when all of the 10 candidates on stage were asked to raise their hands if they were in favor of a dollar raise in revenue and $10 in budget cuts? Not one raised his or her hand. That was the definition of crazy right there. 

[00:44:12]


>> A vivid illustration. You think about mitt romney constantly out trying to get further to the right than anybody who challenged him. 
>> To the right of rick perry on immigration and right of santorum on contraception. These are not the places you win in the middle of the electorate, pretty far outside the mainstream. 
>> Guys like my dad, who never voted for a democratic president in his life, would look at the tv set and go, are they kidding me? I'm turning over to see the atlanta braves. 
>> I want to go to this one, made headlines, the cover story ofthe "atlantic." Why women still can't have it all. All my life I've been on the other side of this exchange and I've been the women smiling the faintly superior smile while another woman told me she had decided to take time out or pursue a less competitive career. So she could spend more time with her family. I've been the one telling young women at my lectures you can have it all and do it all regardless what field you are in which means I've been part, all be interest, unwittingly, of making millions of women feel they are to blame if they could not manage to rise up the ladder as fast as men and also have a family and active home life and be thin and beautiful to boot. It really reignited the debate this article over the decision to stay at home or work full time as I learned recently in my own neighborhood after an altercation with a woman, that debate is very much alive. 
>> She brought nunchakus. 
>> Lord. There's a real tension I thought we had passed. Anyway, that was a very good piece I'm sure you all have no interest in. 

[00:46:13]


>>> Have great interest t- Interest. 
>> I have great interest and mike has great interest. 
>> Women can have it all. 
>> No, they really can't actually. 
>> They can have it all. You suffer and sacrifice things guys doesn't in terms of getting it all. 
>>> Think women who make either decision do, it's absolutely right on both sides of the debate. 
>> We all care deeply, mika, we do. 
>> You would not have wanted to been there at that moment with that lady on my street. You would have run shrivelled up crying. 
>> Jon, thank you for being with us when we return soon. 
>> We will see some of mitt romney's comments running for aig? going did.

=======================================================

Stusing what a perfect solution would have looked like but the end result would have been the largest tax increase in american history. It took an imperfect solution to prevent our constituents from a very real financial pain. In my view, it was worth the effort. 
>> Nbc's luke russert is live on capitol hill. Good morning. Happy new year to you. 
>> Good morning, mara. Good to see you in the chair. 
>> T you very much, sir. So the house republican conference meets at 1:00. Is that speaker boehner's best chance to sell this to republicans? 
>> Reporter: It is. This is by no means a done deal. It did get 9 votes in the senate and one would think such a bipartisan ve in that body would correlate over to the house of representatives but it isn't necessarily the cases specially with the 112th congress. There is some consternation among conservatives for this for a few reasons. Number one they don't like the extension of unemployment benefits and think that adds to the deficit. They don't think there are enough spending cuts. They also don't like the extension of the middle class tax cuts that were the president's stimulus package. Also some liberals don't like the bill because they feel it gives, takes away their leverage to argue for more taxes in the future in terms of deficit deals and the rest of them would only come by cuts. So what you're going to see is at noon, nancy pelosi is going to talk to the house democratic caucus. There have been some rumors that joe biden could come up here on new year's day to sell the plan, very much like he did to the SENATE Ds EARLIER THIS MORNING. You'll also see john boehner meeting with his conference at 1:00 p.M. I've been told by folks close to boehner that these -- it is by no means a done deal. He is keeping the door open to possibly amending the senate bill. Now you think with the 9 votes they wouldn't want to do that, they'd want to put this to bed. But the house republicans have been known to scuttle these types of deals in the 11th hour before. There is some optimism on the senate side but over to the house side, if all goes to plan and they approve it all maybe we see a vote in the early evening but it could very much go into tomorrow if amended. 

[00:02:11]


>> You mentioned vice president biden coming back to step in again. It certainly seemed like he swoopd in at the 11th hour and helped bring this together. Apparently he was very critical to these discussions. 
>> He's the closer. If you saw what he did yesterday, he was able to come back, talk to his senate colleagues he served with, some of them for decades, and say look. This is a really good deal, the best we can get. Here are our advantages within it. Democrats, though, a lot of them are worried because they think they've given away too much. They wanted to go over the cliff. They say the president should negotiate from a position of strength and it should have been the 250 number. We gave too much going up to the 400 number. What is interesting though, mara, is we get -- you take that 250 number and you take about WHAT 250 WAS IN THE '90s, THEY Want to go back to the bill clinton era tax rates, 250 adjusted to inflation is about closer to the 400,000 number threshold you got for individuals. So that's what joe biden, what the white house, a lot of democrats who support this plan have been trying to sell to the liberal colleagues that, look. Adjusted for inflation we did okay here. 
>> All right. Thank you very much. Happy new year. 
>> Take care. You're welcome. 
>> What does the senate bill mean? Can it survive in the house? Vice president joe biden offered words of caution last night. 
>> There are two things you shouldn't do. You shouldn't predict how the senate is going to vote before they vote. You won't make a lot of money. Number two, you surely shouldn't predict how the house is going to vote. 
>> Our guest is a white house reporter for "the washington post" and jill lawrence is managing editor for politics at the national journal. Thank you for joining me and happy new year. 
>> Hi, mara. Same to you. 
>> Thanks mara. 
>> I want to start with you, david. How was the deal reached and why at 2:00 a.M., A full two hours after we had officially gone over that cliff? 
>> One thing we learned, mara, is that with this congress things are going todown to the last minute. Both sides were using their leverage. There were a lot of changes last night to the bill. We haven't talked much about the sequester side but the mandatory spending cuts to the defense department and other places are pushed back for two months. There was a lot of movement on both sides as luke russert talked about on the tax issue. Also on a few other examples such as the estate taxes, the white house sort of gave some ground there. Allowing estates not to be taxed up to $5 million. There was a lot of movement. Joe biden did come in and act as the closer and I think you would see from the house there are a lot of expectations that john boehner is going to have a lot of work to do but that he can't allow this thing to go down again like plan b did. He is, you know, his re-election possibly for the next speakership in two days so he wants to come out looking not only good but strong for the next round in two months. 

[00:04:58]


>> As david mentioned the senate punted on the sequester, the federal spending cuts scheduled to go into effect tomorrow. 
>> Right. 
>> And didn't tackle entitlement reform. Did they miss an opportunity? 
>> Well, I think that opportunity was missed in the boehner/obama negotiations. There really was no time to do anything except the basics right now. And I think there's a good shot that this wi succeed. I think both parties are very conscious of the markets opening tomorrow the republicans have been through situations where they've voted down big plans and the markets have crashed. So I don't think that john boehner wants that on his head and I think that president obama's planning to blame him if t happens. There as lot of work being done to convince some liberal democrats and conservative republicans, because republicans in voting for this would have to vote for a tax rate increase which a lot of them have signed pledges saying they would never do. It's a big step but I think they'll take it. 
>> David, looking at house speaker john boehner a lot of people thought he ended up looking bad when that plan b failed. Does he have the votes for this and/or could his speakership be in trouble? 
>> I don't know that his speakership is in trouble. During a year and a half ago during the debt ceiling debate where house majority leader eric cantor acted up and acted as spokesman for the farther right wing of the caucus, but I think here there's not a lot of suggestions that his speakership could go down but I think it is important for john boehner to reestablish the idea he is somewhat in control of his membership and that they trust him and that he is the leader here. He sort of allowed the senate to take over here really sort of gave up in some ways a few days ago and said, hey. You guys come up with something and bring it back to us. So I think there is a lot of pressure and there isoing to be a lot of calling, cajoling, and making sure that this thing is going to get the votes, at least enough of a combination of democrat and republican votes later today. 
>> Jill, this has been billed as a compromise. What did each side get and have to give with this bill and can either side claim victory here? 

[00:06:59]


>> Well, I think both sides can claim victory but also both sides lost on certain respects. President obama obviously for five, six years he's been talking about this $250,000 income threshold and he did lose on that. But he did gethe principle of raising rates. He didn't get the debt ceiling increase incorporated into the agreement so that is something that is going to have to come up again in two months. Republicans managed to contain the tax increases to half of what president obama had asked speaker boehner for. Only about $600 billion. So everyone has a chance to say they won or lost. The important thing I think here is that they all have a shot at this again in two months and so boehner can say to his republicans, you know, we have a chance for more leverage with debt ceiling debate and also the spending cuts debate that's coming up in two months. And obama can tell his people we're going to stand firm and go for that next $600 billion -- you know, $600 billion in tax increases. Maybe tax reforms. Everyone has an argument to make in the future and I think that is probably why this is going to pass. 
>> All right. We'll leave it at that. Thank you very much. Again, happy new year to you. 
>> Thank you. 
>> Coming up at 10:30 a.M. I'll talk to republican congressman tom cole. Straight ahead, sending well wishes to hillary clinton. We'll have new details on the health of the secretary of state. KEEP IT RIGHT HERE.0y0y3??o????????y 

[00:11:45]


>>> We continue to follow breaking news this new year's day. The house is meeting in a short time to take up its version of the bill to pull us back from the fiscal cliff. The senate came through with the deal in the wee hours of this new year. Now it's up to the house to come to an agreement and vote before the financial markets have a chance to react when they open tomorrow. Majority leader cantor is reportedly saying that no decision on the house vote has been made yet though they expect one soon and we will likely know more after the house republican conference meeting at 1:00 p.M. We are of course keeping a close eye on all of those developments. Another major story we're following this new year's morning. Secretary of state hillary clinton remains hospitalized here in new york for treatment of a blood clot in her head. It is located behind her right ear in a blood vessel that drains blood from the brain but significantly is not in the brain itself. Joining me live now a specialist in the treatment of such things at the university hospitals case medical center in cleveland. Good morning, doctor. 
>> Good morning. Happy new year. 
>> Thank you. You too. Earlier this week a statement from secretary clinton's office said that she had a blood clot stemming from a concussion and it is being treated with blood thinners. Some have noted that treating such a blood clot with a blood thinner would be unusual. Can you explain that. 
>> Not in the secretary's state. It appears what's been reported in the print media and on the web, I don't have precise knowledge what is going on in her case but the blood clot is in a vein that goes around the outside of the brain. 
>> And based on what we know about her current medical condition is there a chance there will be any lasting health effects from this or is it likely that she'll make a full recovery? 
>> I don't know any details about the secretary's condition. That is the majority of patients who have this condition today in the modern era. I think her physicians at presbyterian hospital should be praised for picking it up early. I know from public media that the secretary should have a full recovery. 

[00:13:50]


>> We certainly hope the same as well. Doctors say secretary clinton did not suffer a stroke or neurological damage from the clot that formed after she fainted and fell in her home last month and she suffered a concussion. How common is that? 
>> So she didn't have a stroke and because it's not a vessel going, feeding the brain, blood going to the brain. Rather, it's blood coming from the brain. And I surmise that initially when she fell with the concussion and they imaged her brain they didn't see the clot. So this may very well be a secondary response as part of the healing process from the injury to her brain, from the concussion. 
>> And how long would you expect her to be in the hospital being treated for this? 
>> Well, I think once the doctors reported they wanted to stablize this and once they feel it's stable probably the secretary will be able to leave and be managed as an out patient. 
>> Secretary clinton of course is often named as a possible presidential contender in 2016 and as secretary of state has logged nearly a million miles on airplanes traveling around the world. What does this type of condition mean to her health and level of activity going forward? 
>> I don't think this should have any bearing in the professional activities of secretary clinton. I know many leaders in medicine and science and industry who are -- have blood clots and are anticoagulated who are fully functional, constructive, contributing individuals. I don't think this should have any bearing. 
>> We are all certainly hoping for a full and quick recovery. Thank you for your time. 
>> Thank you. 
>>> Coming up the students who survived the sandy hook shooting will return to school for the first time since the tragedy. A look at how they're coping and what the community is doing to help them out. Stay with us. # .

>>> Tomorrow the children of sandy hook elementary school in connecticut return to class just 18 days after a gunman shot and killed 26 of their classmates and teachers including the school's principal. The children will attend a different school and as part of the welcome back students from around the country are crafting snowflakes as a part of a winter wonderland theme. Joining us now are two school psychiatrists working in the newtown area. Dr. Jennings the medical and <% executive director of family children's aid and dr. Chuck herric who holds a psychiatry chair at danbury hospital. Thank you for joining me. Coming back from a terrible, life altering tragedy like this, what does the school do on its first day back? How quickly do you just try to go back to the lesson plans? 
>> I think you obviously recognize the enormity of the event that occurred. They've already been back to school since that friday so this is really a return from vacation. But I think you try to make everything as normal as possible. It's not normal obviously and there will be opportunities for discussion as children have questions and there will be words of reassurance. What is really remarkable though is you have to look at this in the context of the last two weeks where the entire community and the entire country has pulled together and put together resources and been very supportive. So I think newtown's ready to go back to school. It is a remarkable town. The people are remarkable. I think everybody is wanting to get back to normal and I think as much as possible under the circumstances that is what's going to happen. 
>> And, dr. Herric, this tragedy touched so many people on so many different levels. And for the parents that was a terrifying experience. Can this first day back to school also be challenging for them as they send their children back to class? 
>> Absolutely. The parents have been affected enormously by this, perhaps even more so than the younger children. Younger children take their cues from the parents. It's been a real challenge for them to try and modulate their own emotional reaction to this. So I think ther a lot of trepidation about returning to school on the part of the parents. And so we're taking steps to provide reassurance to them so that they can feel comfortable in helping their kids return to school and get back on the bus and reengage in their normal activities. I think the students are more ready in many ways than the parents are. 

[00:21:24]


>> And, dr. Herric, if and when a child asks a teacher about this, why this happened, about their safety, their concerns, what can teachers do in addressing their students' concerns and fears at this time? 
>> Well, we provided a number of resources available to the teachers. We've engaged the support of dr. Steven marin who has come and helped the teachers to discuss talking points with the students. Also the state has provided a website available to teachers and students on talking points. Teachers and parents on talking points. We're also going to have the support provided for teachers in providing information and how to work with the students during that period of time. So I think the resources are there to help those teachers be able to talk to the students. And if they have any questions they know exactly where to turn to for that type of support. 
>> There's been a lot of activities going on in terms of opportunities for parents and children to get help with questions that they have over the last two weeks so it isn't just a new thing. This has been an ongoing discussion over the last two weeks in many different venues. 
>> And to that end I understand that you both had an opportunity to speak with some of the children in newtown. Dr. Jennings, what are you hearing from them right now? 
>> Well, I think the children are not all talking about it. Those that are, you know, expressing fears about a variety of things, younger children especially have magical thinking so they may think they're somehow responsible. Somebody is going to come into their home, all kinds of fears of that sort. But many children are not particularly asking questions. We had over 1300 people come to the reed school crisis intervention center over the two weeks where there's activit of crafts and more, quite significantly, therapy dogs have been available every day. Psycho therapy is available. And it's been a remarkable experience for children to try to get some normalitiy in parents and also an opportunity to talk about what's going on. That's been going on for over two weeks. I think people have access to getting questions ansed. The county youth and family services has also been providing a lot of help. 

[00:24:03]


>> Thank you so much for your time. I appreciate you being here with me. Happy new year. 
>> Happy new year to you, too. 
>>> Stay with us on a busy new year's day as we head to the white house where the president is waiting and watching just like the rest of us as the house prepares to decide what to do about that fiscal cliff deal passed by the senate. from Is bigger than we think ... like the flu. With aches, fever and chills- the flu's a really big deal. So why treat it like it's a little cold? There's something that works differently than over-the-counter remedies.

[00:27:30]


>>> Right now the bill to p us back from the fiscal cliff heads to the house. At this hour they're starting to gather in the house chamber and will reconvene in 90 minutes. We are waiting to hear if there will be a vote today. The senate approved its version early this morning with an 89-8 vote. I'll talk to a republican congressman in a moment about how he plans to vote on the bill. I'm mara schiavocampo. Here's a quick look at other stories making news now. 
>>> Today 1 million worke in ten states get a bit of a boost in their pay checks. The minimum wage increases from 10 to 35 cents per hour depending on where you live. 
>>> In afghanistan the timetable for turning over security from nato to the afghans is on schedule with the next phase ontrack to begin in two months. The transition will give afghan forces full control by the end of 2014. And it's a very different, very quiet scene this morning in times square on this first day of 2013. Last night was a little different. About a million people welcomed in the new year with the famous ball drop in new york city. The house for now is expected to vote later today or even tomorrow on the fiscal cliff legislation. The senate passed it overwhelmingly in the early hours of the new year with a push from the vice president. For now we go to nbc's kristen welker who is marking the new year at the white house. Good morning and happy new year. 
>> Reporter: Happy new year to you, mara. 
>> What do we know about the president's reaction to this legislation and the senate's vote? 
>> Well, the president, officials here at the white house are feeling confident about the fact that the vote passed the senate with 89 votes. That means it passed with broad, bipartisan support. That sort of helps to put pressure on members of the house to get this legislation through. This is not a bill that just passed with democrats. This is a bill that had 89 votes so, certainly, house speaker john boehner can make the case when he talks to his caucus a little late other than today that, look, this did get a number of votes within both parties. Of course this is not a done deal until everything is signed, sealed, and delivered. So we'll have to see what happens in the house. House speaker john bainer at 1:00 in a talk to his conference, they will voice their concerns, their frustrations. I can tell you that one of the concerns when this goes before the house is that this bill that passed through the senate doesn't really deal with deficit reduction on the level that republicans would have hoped. However, house speaker john boehner can make the argument that, look. The debt ceiling was not included in this bill. This is a fight thae can wage in two months from now when we renegotiate this and we can try to get the type of deficit reduction that republicans have been looking for. And the cuts that republicans have been looking for. From the perspective of the white house and the democrats, they feel as though they have a fair amount of political leverage because of that 89-vote count they got in the senate and also because this is really go time. Something needs to be done and right now it's in the republicans' hands to act. That sort of puts the pressure on republicans. Remember the markets open up tomorrow. They could be impacted by whatever happens in the house. 

[00:30:29]


>> That being said about pressure on republicans, is the white house at all worried about criticism that it's facing on the left over this deal? 
>> I think there certainly was some concern especially last night when the details were just coming out and a number of people on the left were saying this is not a good deal. We didn't get the tax margin we wanted. Remember president obama campaigned saying he wanted to raise taxes on those making $250,000 or more. This legislation raises taxes on individuals making $400,000 or more and $450,000 for couples. It is not exactly what he campaigned on. You heard some voices from the left coming out and saying, they're concerned that ultimately this is going to lead to steep cuts in important programs. And you heard president obama come out yesterday and say, look. This is not perfect. Part of the reason why he came out yesterday by the way, mara, was not just to pressure republicans to sign off on thi deal but also to pressure democrats. Sort of preempting some of that criticism that the white house and democrats wound up getting late last night when the details of this deal started to emerge. I think there was concern before the senate voted last night but certainly they're feeling confident about the fact that it did pass the senate with such strong support. 
>> And we will continue to keep an eye on it. Good to see you and thanks. 
>> You too. Thanks. 
>>> Joining me now live republican congressman tom cole of oklahoma, a member of the house budget and appropriations committee. He was one of the first republicans to support raising taxes on the highest income earners and also one of the fiak publicly about this legislation. Thank you for joining me. 
>> Happy new year to you, mara. 
>>> In the last half hour house leader eric cantor said no decision has been made on whether the house will vote today. Will that decision be made when you and your republican colleagues meet at 1:00 p.M.? 
>> I suspect the leadership will gauge the reaction in the room and that'll be a big factor. They also have a couple other pieces of legislation they want to deal with. This may take a little while but honestly I would argue we should vote on it today. We know the essential details and I think putting this thing to bed before the markets is important. 

[00:32:44]


>> Do you think your republican colleagues are going to try to amend the senate bill? 
>> I think some people probably will but I think we're very late in the process for anything to be added to what's essentially a bipartisan agreement. This is, honestly, I would argue, from a republican perspective, a compromise. You didn't get everything you wanted but when you can make 85% of the bush tax cuts secure for 98% of the american people, give everybody rate certainty, and basically take the revenue piece off the table in our negotiations going forward, we ought to take this deal right now and we'll live to fight another day and it is coming very soon on the spending front. 
>> So it sounds like you're leaning toward voting to approve the senate bill as it stands. 
>> I certainly would do that. No question about it. Both my senators, senator coburn and senator endoff are pretty conservative guys. They supported it. I'm not too worried there is anything too dangerous there. Not too much gets by either one of them. 
>> Notably the senate bill puts the threshold for raising tax rates at 400,000 for individuals, 450,000 for couples. It permanently fixes the alternative minimum tax and extends unemployment benefits for 2 million people but does not extend the payroll tax holiday. It doesn't address entitlement reform and delays the sequester for two months helping set up a series of mini fiscal cliffs in the coming months. What do you like about this and what do you not like about it? 
>> Again, I would prefer not to raise taxes on anybody. But we protected almost every american. We did it at a higher income level than the president campaigned on. And again, frankly, we've denied him I think his most important piece of leverage in any negotiation going forward. So I particularly like that part. I understand unemployment extension. I prefer, you know, a more focused effort in that regard. But we do have parts of the country where that's necessary and it's a fair compromise. The entitlement issue, just too much to deal with I think in one piece of legislation. But again, still sequester is in front of us. The continuing resolution runs out the end of march and obviously the debt ceiling. All of those things honestly are republican leverage not democratic so I think there will be opportunities to deal with the spending issue next year. Honestly I expect that will be the dominant issue along with trying to overhaul the tax code going forward. So that's usually pretty good ground for republicans. 

[00:35:06]


>> Now, this deal was hammered OUT BY mitch McConnell and vice president biden. Speaker boehner was notably left out of the final negotiations. What message does that send? Do you think his job is in jeopardy? 
>> No. Look. I think the speaker has enormous support and I don't think he was left out of the negotiations at all. Number one he didn't try to inject himself in it but the vice president and certainly the republican leader were very cognizant this thing has to go through a republican house. So really john boehner was a lot OF mish McConnell's leverage in this debate. So I'm quite certain not only is his position and his leadership secure but this is, you know, a measured victory. It's not a complete victory. It's a compromise. Each side got something but frankly I can walk away from this one thinking we got a very good deal out of what could have been a catastrophic situation. The president had it in his ability to raise taxes on every single american that pays income taxen you can deny that and limit what could have been $4 trillion worth of tax hikes to say $600 billion that is a win not a lose. 
>> Congressman tom cole appreciate your perspective. Thank you for joining us. 
>> Thank you. 
>> As the details of the fiscal cliff deal were coming together monday republicans were expressing their displeasure with how the president was selling the compromise. It wasn't just the words he used at a monday afternoon news conference but the optics of the president literally standing with the middle class voters that upset some of them including his 2008 opponent SENATOR john McCain. 
>> As I sort out my impression of the president's remarks as to whether to be angry or to be saddened. We have the president of the united states go over and have a cheerleading, ridiculing of republicans exercise. 
>> Joining us now are our strats chris finas and chip salzmann. Thank you for being here on this new year's day. 
>> Thank you. So, chris, I want to start with you. Are these attacks on the president's news conference fair? Did that photo op with voters really risk derailing a deal? 

[00:37:11]


>> Well, there have been a lot of things that risk derailing a deal. The president going out there and using the bully pulpit to pressure republicans if you will to come to their senses and make some kind of compromise for the sake of the country I don't think necessarily was the problem. The problem here from the very get-go is you can't get reicans to yes even when it's in their interest to say yes. And this has been I think the fundamental problem the president has had with speaker boehner from the very beginning. It's impossible to negotiate with speaker boehner because speaker boehner cannot negotiate with his own caucus. And that is the crux of the problem. I UNDERSTAND WHY senator McCain may want to try to make this a problem for the president that he went out there and talked about the need to get a deal done but I think he's got his focus on the wrong targetf you will. 
>> And, chip, vice president biden certainly comes out looking almost glowing with this deal looking almost presidential. How does this burnish his 2016 bona fides should he decide to run? 
>> I think it helps him kind of show that he is a problem solver and was able to come in at the last moment and solve it. He is going to have a lot of natural help being the sitting vice president if he decides to run in 2016 but this kind of gives him a little bit of hey i can fix big problems and look back to this crisis and I came in and fixed it. 
>> And chris, john boehner definitely comes out of these negotiations looking weaker. Notably he couldn't get his plan b through. Does he have anything to fear on thursday when the house votes for speaker? 
>> No. He's got enough votes, you know, to obviously become speaker again. The problem he has is he can't control about 50 to 60 members of his caucus and so going forward it puts him in this impossible position. How does the president negotiate with him again when it comes to the debt ceiling or entitlement reform or immigration reform? You really can't. If nothing else, what I think you'll see over the next two years at least until the mid-term elections is a shift in terms of negotiating focus more toward the senate and trying to get whatever deal may be done on immigration on entitlements, whatever the issue may be. They're first and then shifting to the house because you simply can't negotiate with speaker boehner if he can't control his own caucus. 

[00:39:27]


>> We also saw senators marco rubio and rand paul vote no. Chris, later today we'll see how paul ryan votes. What effect does this compromise have on senators and congressmen thinking ahead to 2016 and the possible run at the presidency? 
>> I think some of them -- oh, chris go ahead. 
>> Well, I think what's happening here is, you know, anyone who is thinking about 2016 is looking at the back of their heads how these votes play out. Senator rubio voted against the legislation with clear intentions of making this a position when he runs for president. So I will use my crystal ball and predict that paul ryan will probably vote against it as well. 
>> And, chip, I want to give you the last word. Your take? 
>> Yeah. I think chris is right. I think they're already looking at how is this going to affect me and the primary in 2015 in iowa, new hampshire, and south carolina, and I think unfortunately I've always thought good public policy makes good politics not vice versa. I think they have to be careful how they view that. 
>> All right. Thank you both for joining me. Happy new year. 
>> Thank you. Happy new year to you. 
>>> Well, coming up while we wait on the house to reconvene a look at how the markets may react if the deal gets done or if it doesn't. tough. ?????? ?????? doing it with a cold, just not going to happen.

>>> now that the senate has passed a bill to avoid the fiscal cliff it is time for the house to consider the measure and as it does the markets are watching closely. How will the outcome impact the u.S. Economy both short and long term? Daniel gross is a columnist and business editor. Good morning. 
>> Good morning. Happy new year. 
>> Happy new year to you too. When we wake up tomorrow how do you expect the markets to react to the deal in the senate if that is still all we have left? 
>> We'll get the first reactions before we wake up tomorrow. The markets open in asia and europe and we often take our cues from that. Yesterday during the afternoon as the deal came into focus the stock market rail antidepressant closed up more than 1%. I think the reaction is generally favorable not just that we've averted this horrible cliff but you look at the -- in the deal the tax on capital gains and dividends which are things that investors care about. You know, they're getting off very lightly. They're not going up that much. I think overall it is quite positive. That's assuming the house passes it today or indicates that they will pass it this week. 
>> Now if the bill goes down in den the house and we do officially go over that cliff at least for a short time what kind of ripple effect could that produce across the american economy? Could we be facing another recession? 
>> I think we have become so used to political dysfunction that it doesn't phase us so much anymore. If you remember back I 2008 when the house republicans voted down the t.A.R.P. Bill everybody freaked out about that. The market was falling 500, 600 points. People were firing people by the tens of thousands. I think over the last few years, with the debt ceiling, with this constant gridlock, with the filibustering of everything, with all these crises we continue to manufacture, it seems like the private sector is kind of just going about its business. You look at the last couple years, the markets have generally powered ahead. People keep buying government bonds despite all our debt and the job market is improving. So I don't really see this continuing warfare in washington derailing that instantly. 

[00:45:56]


>> Now, this for the moment kicks sequestration, federal spending cuts, down the road at the same time another fight over the debt ceiling looms. Could the two issues scuttle any progress made on avoiding the cliff? 
>> I think the debt ceiling is really the move powerful and problematic. We saw this in august of 2011 when people start to raise questions about is the government actually going to pay its debt, can the government issue bonds, can it fund its operations, that's a pretty serious situation. If it gets to that point, we technically hit this debt ceiling, there are things the treasury secretary can do over the next couple months, avoiding putting payments into pension plans, things like that so we don't go over it. But at some point that has to be resolved and resolved in such a way that, you know, we are able to borrow, that people, bond investors will know they can buy these bonds and that the government will not be shutting down for lack of funds. I think that is the more serious of the two issues. 
>> From a main street perspective, we just finished the holiday shopping season and the sales numbers weren't very encouraging and a lot of analysts said one of the reasons, one of the things that impacted consumer confidence were fears over the looming fiscal cliff. Is it possible that regardless of what happens with the house or with this deal that there will be an effect on consumer confidence and spending down the road? 
>> Well, I think we are going to see in effect spending and perhaps consumer confidence just because the payroll taxes have essentially gone away. These were not part of the fiscal cliff conversations. For the last couple years people were only paying 4.2% on their first $106,000 of income. Starting next week at 6.2% so someone who makes $50,000, that is an extra I think thousand dollars a year. So anybody who gets income from their paycheck is going to see a smaller paycheck starting with their first one because the payroll tax holiday expired and, you know, for people who are walmart shoppers who are spending what they earn, this means less income for them. So I think we are going to see that show up in consumption, retail sales to a certain degree almost immediately. 

[00:48:11]


>> All right. Daniel gross, thank you for that perspective. Happy new year to you sir. 
>> Thank you. Happy new year. 
>>> Now to some good news from capitol hill. Almost a year after a stroke left him barely able to move the left side of his body republican senator mark kirk of illinois is expected to return to congress later this week.

>>> president obama has been immersed in the fiscal cliff battle almost since election night but much political capital has already been spent. What does that mean for issues like immigration reform and gun control in his second term? Joining us are david and jill. Thanks for coming back, guys. The president has a lot on his plate. How much of what is ultimately able to get done depends on the outcome of this fiscal cliff fight? 
>> Well, I guess the temptation is to say this is going to use up all the energy and fighting spirit of the white house but the president has four years, maybe two, maybe one before the mid terms, one after. I think that there's a legacy situation in play here and so I'm pretty sure that he is going to want to not leave huge debt and there is also a situation where what's good for him is also good in some respects for republicans. So do republicans want immigration reform before the next election? Do they want to dig out of the hole they're in with hispanic voters? So there is some mutual interest. I think that gun fight is going to be very difficult but I think that's something that we're going to see, if it doesn't happen this year it may happen the next year or the year after. It is just something that i think the president will want to leave office having achieved. So nothing is going to be easy. We'll have very many brinks, you know, and a lot of fighting over principles which is not a bad thing but I think ultimately a lot of these issues will be addressed. 
>> David, sequestration was pushed off for two mons meaning we'll have to have this fight all over again in a few short weeks. If that's the case how long will president obama realistically have to deal with gun control and immigration not to mention his plans for infrastructure and even green energy? 
>> That's the problem. If you remember, right after the election, after latinos came out and overwhelming numbers to support democrats and president obama's re-election, the president said one of the first things I want to do in january is immigration. Let's tackle that. There was a lot of disappointment among especially the latino community about the president's push on that. In the first terme was dealing with other things. He said we'll do that in january. Then you had this terrible situation in sandy hook elementary school in connecticut. The president said one of the first things I want to do in january, I'm going to push on gun control. Vice president biden is heading this commission and is supposed to come back with recommendations. Yet you see vice president biden on the hill yesterday dealing with the fiscal cliff. If you're going to have two more months of positioning on the fiscal cliff, how deep does the president go on that or does he go on immigration or gun control or energy which he said yesterday is another priority in his state of the union speech and really push? Because the white house has to prioritize and right now the economy continues to be the number one priority for the foreseeable future. 

[00:54:36]


>> Jill, if this fiscal cliff bill does get done is the new congress going to be more or less likely to work with the president on his second term agenda? 
>> Well, the president is going to have more senators to work with, 55 as opposed to 53. That doesn't mean he'll have an easy time of it because republicans can block anything they want in the senate. It depends on what lessons if any republicans took from the election. I do think that the principle gap is very deep and so I'm not sure that we're going to see a kumbaya situation. But as I say, there are some advantages for republicans in making some compromises if they will see it that way. And particularly the demographic challenges. So, you know, ultimately I think the one thing to do is keep -- be realistic about the timetable. I'm not sure the president is going to get everything done that he wants to in 2013 but i would bet on immigration form. Maybe that's crazy and you'll have me back here and I'll have to say no I was wrong. I do think it's so much in republicans' self-interest. They've got some really good spokesmen on that score like marco rubio that some movement may be seen there all right. Thank you for that prediction. Thank you both for joining me. 
>> Thank you.

=======================================================

C ucus meeting of 2013 they'll hear from none other than vice president joe biden who will come here to capitol hill to brief them about the deal similar to what he did last night for his senate democratic faithful. He was really influential in helping get a lot of democrats to vote for the bill. It is expected he'll do the same thing today when he talks to his house democratic friends. Now, there should be no surprise. Nancy pelosi when the white house asked her to get votes she is very good at it. She got votes for the budget control act, for health care. There should be no reason she shouldn't be able to get the votes today. With vice president biden coming to capitol hill it rests the nerves of any anxious democrats who don't like the deal because they don't like the $400,000 threshold and would prefer 250 and also feel the president was losing some negotiating leverage. Biden being here, pelosi onboard it should be okay on the house democratic side. 
>> You are often privy to juicy little nuggets of behind-the-scenes information. Do you have any thoughts on how vice president biden became so key to all of this? 
>> Well, I think there is a basic trust factor that mitch McCONNELL HAS WITH JOE BIDEN. They served together for over 20 years. They know each other. From a lot of conversations i had especially with the older bulls I sort of call them, they say joe biden is a guy you can do business with. That the president doesn't understand how to negotiate room to room, you know, person to person, that joe biden gets that. He gets the personality of it. And it's a relationship built up over years. So if anything, joe biden bring that sort of old school mentality to capitol hill and for all the children's we see in our country and for all of the sort of new faces that are coming in here, politically in the house and the senate, it still is very much run by folks IN THEIR 70s, THE SORT OF OLD Bulls who have been here a while and seen a lot. 
>> As we mentioned the republicans are meeting at 1:00 p.M. And you being the great colleague you are you put together a little cheat sheet for me. In this you have underlined and highlighted that speaker boehner's briefing of the republican conference is the most important meeting of the entire fiscal cliff saga. Why and what can we expect to happen? 

[00:02:06]


>> It's the most important meeting, mara, because there is a chance, not saying it's a great chance, but a very -- it is very alive if you will that this bill could be struck down. The house republican conference is not totally sold on it. Why? Some conservative outside groups are against it. A lot of folks in the house republican caucus come from republican districts and are always worried about a primary challenger. Speaker boehner, eric cantor have not been overly supportive so far. They reserve the right to amend it. There are three options. We could all hold hands and jp off into the deep end together. That would be the house republican conference approving of this bill, at least enough of them joining the democrats to move it forward. You could also see house republicans try to amend it. That's what tom cole is talking about on your air. He doesn't think that would happen and doesn't want that to happen but it certainly is a possibility if some conservative house republicans say we don't like this part of the deal let's send it back over to the senate. That puts us in sort of a chaos with so little time. Today is a free day. The markets close. What happens tomorrow if there is still not a fiscal deal in place? Lastly if there is an all out rejection all bets are off, we're jumping over the fiscal cliff. It is up to john boehner to gauge how his conference is going to react to this bill and from folks I've talked to there is a little bit of nervousness among house republican leaders. They have been left at altar many times by their conservative flank. Real quickly back last yea in 2011 the senate passed the payroll tax cut extension 89-11. Very similar to what weaw the vote was earlier this morning. That was then defeated in the house of representatives a few days later. Not saying we can see history repeat itself, but it has happened before, mara. 
>> All right. Nbc's luke russert, thank you and happy new year, my friend. 
>> Take care. Be well. 
>> All right. 
>>> House and senate leaders are using every last second to try to sell their membership on this deal, something even president obama commented upon himself on monday. 
>> One thing we can count on with respect to this congress is that if there is even one second left before you have to do what you're supposed to do, they will use that last second. 

[00:04:12]


>> And joining us now from capitol hill, democratic congresswoman debby wassermann schultz of florida who also serves as the dnc chair. Thank you for joining me. 
>> Thank you, mara. Great to be with you. Happy new year. 
>> In about an hour your conference meets on this bill. In attendance will be vice president joe biden. Is it going to be difficult to sell your party on this deal? 
>> Well, I think that we're going to come together in about an hour as a democratic caucus and hear the vice president out. There are a lot of good things in this bill that make sense and that I think it will ultimately earn the overwhelming majority of house democratic votes. We made sure that as we committed throughout this last campaign that we would not allow taxes to increase on 98% of americans that's in this deal. We made sure that we pushed off a really significant slashing of defense spending as well as domestic spending and we'll make sure going forward that whatever deal we do reach on those spending cuts is balanced when it comes to both revenue and spending cuts. And that's the overall -- overriding commitment here is we have a balanced plan in front of us and we'll need to -- any further deals made in the future continue to have a balanced plan. 
>> There are some in your party who don't like this plan. Senator tom harken called it a very bad deal. Did the president and the vice president get the best deal they could? 
>> I think in order to make sure that 98% of americans didn't see their tax rates go up, yes. Absolutely. We wanted to make sure the wealthiest americans, wealthiest 2% of americans paid a little bit more. We wanted to avoid tax increases on the middle class. We wanted to make sure we preserved medicare and social security and we wanted to make sure that we avoided deep spending cuts and when we deal with those spending cuts down the road we'll continue to focus on making sure. Remember a year ago we voted for over a trillion dollars in spending cuts only. Any deal going forward to deal with those, avoiding the sequester, is going to need to continue to focus on that balance. That is what the amerin people voted for in this election. 

[00:06:15]


>> The house gop is scheduled to meet about this bill at 1:00 p.M. Do you think the majority of republicans will pass this plan? 
>> Well, hard to say what the house republicans will do particularly with some of their more extreme tea party members is a challenge I won't take on. But I can tell you that house democrats are ready to make sure that we avoid those tax increases on the middle class. That we ensure the wealthiest americans pay a little bit more. That we ensure that we protect social security and medicare and senior citizens and that whatever we do going forward is balanced so that the middle class doesn't bear the burden of any of these decisions in the future. 
>> Now, the fight over spending cuts now happens in two months. Does that mean we're basically going to be doing this all over again in just a short time? 
>> Well, it means we have more work to do. And I think that's okay. We want to make -- anything worth doing is worth doing thoroughly and with a lot of thought. And so we want to make sure that whatever we do related to the sequester and the domestic and defense spending cuts is not done in haste and, again, that the decision we ultimately make doesn't balance all the pain on the backs of the middle class. That's what we avoided here today and what we'll continue to focus on in the future. 
>> Are they willing to give anything on entitlements? 
>> The president has proposed more than $360 billion in entitlement savings in his $4 trillion deficit reduction plan. We need to reduce the deficit. We know we need to reduce spending. Any deal in the future that is the rest of this deal and brings it to completion is going to need to have both revenue and spending cuts and we're going to need to make sure that we add entitlement savings. We have that opportunity. The republicans just need to continue to get more of their members to agree to say yes. 
>> All right. Congresswoman debby wassermann schultz, thanks so much for your time. 
>> Thank you, mara. 
>> So who won, who lost? Who compromised and who held firm? Where does this leave embattled house speaker john boehner? Reed wilson is editor-in-chief for national journal's hotline. Thank you both for being here today. Ryan, let's talk about what we'll see in the house. Do you expect a full scale revolt from conservative members who vowed to vote against any tax increase? 

[00:08:30]


>> Well, I don't know. We'll find out early this afternoon. What I'm hearing is that the conservative members have three major problems with the bill that came over from the senate. One is that there are no spending cuts included. Two is that they don't believe that the offsets for the sequester are legitimate. They think this i.R.A. To roth i.R. As is bogus and three they don't think the extension of emergency unemployment is unpaid for. So they're going to be pushing to amend it one way or another. They'll be pushing to add spending cuts to it or maybe some type of pay for unemployment or redoing the way the sequester is paid for. If they do that, and if they do it in a kind of poison pill way and send it back to the senate, the senate could reject it. If they tried to put, say, cuts to social security through chain cpi as the spending cuts that would blow the whole thing up. Now, maybe there's some type of spending cuts or tax cuts that they could work into this that wouldn't kill it in the senate. But either way, you're introducing a ton of uncertainty and congress just wants to get this thing done with right now. So I think more likely is that they find some retiring and some safe members who vote with democrats and they move it through. 
>> Now, reed, speaker boehner seems to be between a rock and a hard place to pass this bill. He probably has to work around part of the tea party faction and the party to try to form a coalition of democrats and moderate republicans. Couldn't he lose his speakership by doing that? 
>> He is not going to lose his speakership this term by doing it. The vote comes up on january 3rd, WHICH IS A THURSDAY. He'll be re-elected to speaker. But what ryan got to was this really interesting sort of tug and pull on -- within the republican conference right now. There is this effort to be as conservative as possible on every single possible vote. And even the guys who are going to vote for the compromise package and try to get a deal done when the vote comes up today, if they have opportunities to vote on amendments that make things more conservative, they're going to take that opportunity, which means that this thing, there is a real risk of this bill being kicked back into the senate and us having to go through this whole thing once again. So that is sort of tug and pull between the conservative faction here not only in the house of representatives but also in sort of the interest group community that spends so much money and pays so much attention to republican primaries is pulling a lot of members, even those who would work toward the compromise a little toward the right especially in this amendment process. 

[00:11:04]


>> Right. And gamin this out just a little further let's say if the republicans did amend it and they put in something, even some mild spending cuts, you know, democrats are already pretty uncomfortable with this deal. You put in anything else and you could tip it so that all of the democrats decide, you know what? We're not playing these republican games and we're going to vote against it en masse like we were going to with plan b. Then boehner's left trying to pass it with only his own conference and there are a good 50 or so tea partiers who aren't going to vote for it period. And so then he is stuck again. That makes amendin this in any way no matter how much they mighnt to, how clever they might want to get, makes it extremely risky to try. 
>> Very tricky calculations here. Reed wilson and ryan grim thank you both. We'll check back in with you a little later this hour. 
>> Happy new year. 
>> You too. 
>>> Coming up a new year means new laws. Some 400 new laws are taking effect across the country today. We'll have more on that. Of course any developments from capitol hill.My name's lisa, and chantix helped me quit. I honestly loved smoking, and I honestly didn't think I would ever quit.

[ Male Announcer ] SOME PEOPLE HAD CHANGES In behavior, thinking or mood, hostility, agitation, depressed mood and suicidal thoughts or actions while taking or after stopping chantix. If you notice any of these stop taking chantix and call your doctor right away. Tell your doctor about any history of depression or other mental health problems, which could get worse while taking chantix. Don't take chantix if you've had a serious allergic or skin reaction to it. If you develop these stop taking chantix and see your doctor right away as some can be life-threatening. If you have a history of heart or blood vessel problems, tell your doctor if you have new or worse symptoms. Get medical help right away if you have symptoms of a heart attack. Use caution when driving or operating machinery. Common side effects include nausea, trouble sleeping and unusual dreams. With chantix and with the support system it worked. It worked for me.

>>> We are of course keeping a close eye on developments this hour on capitol hill. In less than an hour the house officially will clock in and take up the senate fiscal cliff vote for last night. Here's what we know will happen after that. Nancy pelosi will brief her democratic caucus at noon as well joined by a very special guest, vice president joe biden. At 1:00 p.M. Eastern speaker john boehner briefs his caucus in what our own luke russert calls the most important meeting of the day. After that we should get a sense of when a vote would take place and whether the speaker will allow any amendments. We'll keep bringing you the latest information on that fiscal cliff deal. And of course every new year brings a series of new and sometimes kind of strange new laws. 2013 is no exception. Here are just a couple. In illinois motorcyclists will not be able to proceed through a red light if it fails to change. Even if it's broken they just have to stay there forever. 
>>> In kentucky it will no longer be legal to release feril or wild hogs into the wild. In florida, swamp buggies will now legally be considered motor vehicles. 
>>> All in all over 400 new laws are on the books today across the country. 
>>> Coming up, armed guards in school. The president said he doesn't think it's the right idea. We talked to one new jersey mayor who disagrees and is already doing something about that. Stay with us.

>>> One idea to protect children from mass shootings calls for more armed security in schools. It is an idea that has drawn favor from republicans and some democrats but one that president obama was reluctant to embrace during his interview with nbc's david gregory on "meet the press" sunday. 
>> We have an armed guard. Like at every school in the country, that is what the nra believes could work. 
>> I am not going to prejudge the recommendations given to me. I am skeptical the only answer is putting more guns in schools. 
>> Joining us now the mayor and chief zek stiff of marlboro township in new jersey and has decided to place armed guards at his schools when they return from vacation this week. Thanks for joining us. Happy new year. 
>> So you are a democrat but you do support the idea of having more security in schools. Why and what have you decided to do in your township? 
>> As mayor of my town I'm in charge of security. And I don't make federal policy. I don't make state policy. I'm not making a statement on the nra. We need to keep our 8,000 school children safe. With the unfortunate events that happened in newtown, connecticut the only way we could take immediate steps is put a police officer, a trained professional in our schools until we could realize what other security measures we could take in order to keep our children safe. 
>> The governor of your state disagrees with you. Chris christie said a week ago, quote, you don't want to make this an armed for kids. How would you respond to that? 
>> I disagree with the governor. I think that our police officers are well trained. They're the ones we call when there is an emergency. We hope they get there quickly. Until such time as we can change our security protocol and address the issues that happened in newtown, connecticut, this is the most immediate step and actions we can take, that I can take that our board of education could take. I haven't heard a suggestion out of the governor's office or any other of the elected officials who are saying they're uncomfortable. These aren't armed guards. These are professionals. Police officers. The ones we call when there is an emergency. And if they're there to calm and possibly deter a future event. So I hope our 8,000 students in marlboro will feel safe with having him present. 

[00:21:51]


>> But there are some who point out there were armed guards at columbine and that didn't stop the tragedy there. 
>> I understand that and it's unfortunate. However, when there is an emergency event you want your professionals on the spot. Each of our police officers are trained as emergency response technicians and they are the ones you want on the scene when there is an emergency. This is -- you can't sit back and take no action. After what happened in newtown. If you are an elected official in this country and your position right now is to hope that event doesn't happen in your town I believe that's a mistake and that is not what we're prepared to do in marlboro township. 
>> Vice president joe biden has been tasked with heading up the administration's efforts on any kind of gun control reform. What would you tell him needs to happen? What would you say to him? 
>> I think we need to ban assault weapons. I think we have to lower the magazine clips, multi capacity magazine clips. I believe there are tighter restrictions and licensing requirements, get rid of the gun gear loop holes. I'm not here to be in the presidential debate. I am here to keep marlboro school children safe. What newtown has shown us, that existing security protocol was not safe. It was not adequate. So we need to go to the next step. And we're going to put our police officers in the school until such time as we get a report out of newtown we take a look at how we can improve security, all of the guys are keeping our students safe. 
>> What effect do you think that might have on the children and on the school environment having armed guards present at facing these threats in a very tangible way and having to see an armed guard in their school? 
>> We've had school resource officers in marlboro township for years. The program has gotten cut back with the economy and the fiscal concerns. But our police officers are integrated into our community. I believe that marlboro school children see police officers and look at them as somebody to protect, somebody safe. Somebody to go to. And I don't think it's going to cause any fear. It's going to be a comforting, it's going to be safety. It's going to make them feel better and could act as a deterrent.

>>> Just a half hour now until speaker boehner and the house efficiently get back to work in washington. If there is one thing that's for sure they'll have to make a move sooner rather than later. The speaker wanted the senate to act and now it's the house's turn. Coming up I'll talk to one representative about what he expects to happen today. 
>>> I'm mara schiavocampo. Here is a quick look at other stories making news now. Today 1 million workers in ten states get a bit of a boost in their pay checks. The minimum wage increases by anywhere from 10 to 35 cents per hour depending where you live. In afghanistan the timetable for turning over security from nato to the afghans is on schedule with the next phase ontrack to begin in two months. The transition will give afghan forces full control by the end of 2014. And it's a very different and very quiet scene this morning in times sq on the first day of 2013. Last night was a little different. About a million people welcomed in the new year with the famous ball drop in new york city. The house is set to reconvene in about half an hour to begin expected consideration of the fiscal cliff deal passed by the senate. Before any vote republican and democratic leaders will hold separate conference meetings with their members to gauge whether indeed it can pass. Joining us now is nbc news deputy political editor dominico montenaro. What are leaders telling their members in these caucuses and what do you make of the news vice president joe biden will attend the democrats' closed door meeting? 
>> I think vice president biden like he did last night is going to have to make the sale one more time to his fellow democrats to say, look. This is the best we can get. This is what we worked out. Let's get it done before the markets open to make sure we give some certainty. 
>> And what's going to be the hardest sell for both parties? 

[00:29:07]


>> I think there are a few things that are going to be tough sells. I think that democrats don't want to feel like president obama caved on the tax rates. He campaigned pretty strongly on the $250,000 threshold. Now that is moving to $400,000, $450,000 for couples. I think that democrats are thinking we could have gone over and just a couple days republicans would have had to come back and probably would have -- democrats would have had more leverage. That said I think that vice president biden will argue that, you know, this was reasonable and you want to give certainty again to those markets and be able to look reasonable in this process. I think for republicans there are going to be a couple things. First they don't want taxes to go up on anybody and this essentially makes them look like they're voting for a tax increase although they actually would be voting for a tax cut but it is amazing the way it's been framed by both conservative groups and the white house, interestingly. I do think that there are a few things in there in the details if you think about the estate tax change, the changes to dividends and capital gains, and the fact that mostly it avoids spending cuts and pushes this down to just another couple months and there are no entitlement reforms in there. I think those will be tough sells for republicans but whether or not john boehner is going to allow this to come to the floor with such an overwhelming vote in the senate is the real question. 
>> All right. Thanks so much. 
>> Thanks, mara. 
>>> And joining me live now democratic congressman adam schiff of california. A member of the house appropriations and intelligence committees. Happy new year and thank you for being here. 
>> Happy new year to you. 
>> House republican leader eric canter says no decision has been made on whether the house will vote on the measure that passed the senate earlier this morning. Do you expect a vote today? 
>> I do expect a vote today though it is still very much in question what we'll have to vote on, whether it is exactly what the senate passed or the house will take up amendments to it. I would strongly caution the house republicans that if they do amend this, if they monkey around with what the senate agreed to on a very strongly bipartisan basis, they'll need to put up the votes to pass it. I'm not sure they can do it. It may die in the senate if they do it and if they do that they will own this and own the real going over the cliff. So it's a pretty precarious balance already. I would encourage them to take up what the senate passed. It has plenty to like and plenty not to like about it. A lot of it gives me indigestion. But my primary concern is that we not go back into another recession. I think this does have the merit of avoiding the potential of a double dip recession. 

[00:31:38]


>> You say a lot of it gives you indigestion. What don't you like about this? 
>> Well, I think that it protects the middle class which I like. On the other hand it doesn't raise enough revenue to deal with the deficit and debt so we'll need to raise more revenue. It also puts off the spending decisions for another only two months so we'll have another big brawl over the debt ceiling and over spending cuts in a couple months so we haven't really resolved the big picture items. So those are a couple of the concerns that I have. I think the estate tax is more generous than we can afford. But I do think it I a compromise and I knew there were going to be parts of it i wouldn't like. The thing I would like the least is if we fail to come to agreement and we risk putting the country into another recession. That would be devastating to the middle class, to working families, to the whole country. That has to be avoided. At this point, my biggest concern is that the house of representatives gets cute and they try to either put poison pills in it or try to amend it to get a few more of their members to vote for it and that may simply sink the deal. 
>> Now, you and your house democratic colleagues are scheduled to meet in about a half hour and house republicans are scheduled to meet at 1:00 p.M. So what do you think? Can the senate bill pass the house as it stands? 
>> I think it can. Given the strong vote that it had in the senate, it's hard to imagine it failing in the house. You know, anything is possible. It's certainly possible that the house gop votes en masse against it but I think some of the gop members will support it. And there are many in our caucus on the democratic side who won't like the provisions that i mentioned, so I think the vice president will come in. He will do what he does well, which is he will make a pitch for why our caucus should get behind it and I think he'll be largely successful. So I think probably the best case scenario for the country is that the gop takes the measure up as it passed in the strongly bipartisan fashion in the senate, that the vice president makes a successful pitch to our caucus, and that we move forward. But I do hope and this is critical that we don't simply g back to this kind of quagmire of indecision two months from now and fight over the debt ceiling and the president is absolutely right to say he won't play that game. I think the business community needs to weigh in with our speaker and tell him that we can't play russian roulette with the full faith and credit of the country. It would be too destructive of our economy. 

[00:33:58]


>> As you know, this went into the wee hours of the morning. The senate was voting at 2:00 in the morning. So now you're there at work on new year's day. How does it feel being part of the house's first new year's day session in decades since 1951? 
>> Well, I went to see lincoln last night with a couple colleagues and we went to see the emancipation proclamation that just turned 150 so it wasn't the new year's that i would have chosen but it turned out okay. 
>> Hopefully you got a glass of champagne in there too. Thank you very much for joining me. 
>> Thank you. 
>>> So can house leaders sell their membership on the senate's fiscal cliff deal or will factions inside either party derail it such as the tea party members did to boehner's plan b? Well, even the man who helped craft the current deal says it's impossible to tell how a senator house vote is going to go. 
>> There's two things you shouldn't do. You shouldn't predict how the senate is going to vote before they vote. You won't make a lot of money. And, number two, you surely shouldn't predict how the house is going to go. 
>> Joining us now are our strats david goodfriend the democratic strategist and robert trainum a former bush/cheney senior adviser and msnbc contributor. Welcome to both of you. 
>> Happy new year. 
>> As the vice president indicated no deal is final. Does the gop's tea party faction have the strength to scuttle this deal? 
>> I think they have the strength to make a lot of noise about it but qui frankly as the congressman mentioned a few moments ago with such a strong bipartisan support out of the senate, almost 90 votes, and with such a large majority of the democratic caucus on the house side most likely will be voting for this and obviously be some folks on the republican side I don't see this bill not passing. I do think it will pass later today or perhaps maytomorrow. 
>> And, david, what about democrats? Not everyone is happy that the income tax level starts in the $400,000 range. Is that why biden is going to be in that room later today to talk to democrats? 
>> Yeah. There is some discord among democrats certainly. You mentioned one of the issues. A lot of democrats wanted to see the threshold for higher taxes start at $250,000 for a family. However, there is a lot in there to mollify the base. For example, for incomes $250,000 and above for individuals, $300,000 for families there is a cap as mitt romney talked about and that is a way of raising revenue from the top 2%. More over there is the preservation of a lot of important things to democrats, tax credits for lower income, middle income families, tax credits for investment, bonus depreciation provision and renewable energy. So there are things in there that I think the vice president will use to try to convince democrats that it's a good deal for everybody including them. 

[00:36:43]


>> Can I respond to that? 
>> Absolutely. 
>> David brings up a very good point. This is a very big bill. I obviously just looked at the top line stuff. WHAT leader McConnell and vice president biden did was borderline brilliant where there is a little bit in here for everybody, both conservatives but also progressives where they can go back to the constituency specifically the house and say i voted for this and here is why. There is farm stuff in there, really some good stuff folks can give them comfort and say this is a good thing for our constituency. 
>> And, you know, we've heard a lot of people this morning refer to vice president biden as the closer. He certainly comes out looking very good in this. Assuming that this does pass, robert, does anyone other than the vice president come out looking like a winner? Conversely, who ends up losing? A lot of people are worried about how john boehner is faring. 
>> When you take a look at this and peel the onion back and look at the different layers mitch McCONNELL AND JOE BIDEN CLEARLY Have a friendship. They have a relationship there. Joe biden served in the senate WITH mitch McConnell for almost 20 plus years. This is really how deals get done, in a truly bipartisan fashion. Quite frankly, a true deal is when both progressives and conservatives are upset because they both had to give up something here. I think the downside here shall the thumbs down most likely would unfortunately be speaker boehner and leader reed where maybe even the president to a certain degree simply because they weren't able to close the deal like vice president biden DID AND senator McConnell did. 
>> And, david, we saw senators rand paul and marco rubio vote against the bill. Do you think they're positioning themselves for 2016? 
>> Well, they represent the far right wing of the republican party today which increasingly seems to be out of step with main stream americans. Look. The polling in this instance shows a vast overwhelming majority of americans want to see a deal done, they want to see compromises made. And even if these two gentlemen are positioning themselves for a run at 2016, I think it should send a cautionary note to the republican party in general. It's time for that party to retool for a different kind of election. And hopefully, I would like to see a robust, successful republican party because that would bring things more to the middle. Right now if republican leadership is pushing ever more to the right, all they're going to do is alienate themselves from the larger national debate and that leads to extremism and that is not good. 

[00:38:59]


>> All right. David,, robert, thanks for your insight. 
>>> Another major story we're following secretary of state clinton is still hospitalized in new york for treatment of a blood clot in her head. The clot is located behind her right ear in a blood vessel that drains blood from the brain but significantly it is not in the brain itself. Joining me live now dr. Alvin schmeyer who specializes in the treatment of such things at case hospital in cleveland. Welcome. 
>> Happy new year. 
>> You too. Doctors are using blood thinners to dissolve the clot a are confident the secretary of state will make a full recovery. Are blood thinners the usual course of treatment for something like this? 
>> Yes they are. They actually don't dissolve the clot. They just prevent it from progressing and then the natural clot mechanisms will dissolve the clot over time. 
>> We mentioned that clot is not in her brain. If it were that would be a much greater threat is that correct? 
>> Of course. 
>> Tell me a little bit about the science there. It is located close to the area but not within it. 
>> So the vein, she has a vein that is draining the brain i.E. The blood that comes to the brain through the arteries comes out and is draining the brain. Her clot was not very large apparently and probably came on as a result of her injury from the concussion. I imagine it was not present when they did the first mri when they diagnosed her concussion. Had she had a clot of a blood vessel going to the brain, then there would have been a plug. And sort of like crimping a garden hose. You essentially stop flow to the brain. That causes instant injury to the brain. That is not the case that has happened to secretary clinton. 
>> And doctors say she did not suffer a stroke or neurological damage from the clot that formed after she fainted and fell at her home last month and she suffered a concussion. Is that common? 

[00:41:02]


>> So it's, the concussion and the relationship to this clot in a vein coming from the brain is not common. It's actually quite unusual. And I think it's a testament to the perseverance of her doctors to get a followup mri that probably diagnosed it in an early stage. This is a very uncommon clot occurring in only about 8 of 100 people who get a blood clot and is not frequently recognized. So I think she's had very good care at columbia presbyterian. 
>> And, doctor, just a quick, final question. How closely and frequently will she have to be monitored if and when she gets out of the hospital? 
>> It depends on the stability or anticoagulation. Initially I'm sure she'll have close monitoring. And then in time when she is stable the monitoring will be less. It also has to do with a choice of the anticoagulants used as to the degree of monitoring she'll need. 
>> Thank you for joining me on this new year's day. 
>> Happy new year's to all. 
>> Thank you. 
>>> Coming up even if they reach a deal this kick the can congress leaves plenty of work for the new year.A massive heart attack.

>>> If the house manages to pass the senate bill on avoiding the fiscal cliff and that remains a big if it will represent just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to the economic challenges facing the president and congress over the next several years. Rick newman is chief business correspondent for u.S. News and world report and the author of "rebounders." How winners pivot back to success. Welcome. Thank you for joining me. 
>> Hi, mara. 
>> Before we get to the battles ahead who is the rebounder in the senate deal? 
>> WELL, mitch McConnell looks pretty good. This is the guy who said his main objective prior to 2012 was getting president obama unelected. That didn't happen obviously. He just looked like an obstructionist. Now he is playing a productive role getting some things done for the nation. 
>> Now, it looks like in this deal the senate bill punts a lot of things down the road and we could see a debt ceiling debate in the near future. 
>> Yes. 
>> How can we avoid the kind of brinksmanship we've just seen in the issues we've got moving forward? 
>> I'm not sure we can avoid it. That is why this deal, it is going to be a relief for the markets that there is some deal that doesn't involve tax increases for most people. It puts off most of the big issues. I mean, if anything was going to happen, it was going to be that the middle class tax cuts would be extended and perhaps permanently which looks like we're seeing. That was the low hanging fruit in this, the easy part. The hard things all have been pushed off. We know we'll have a big battle over the borwing limit being extended toward the end of february beginning of march. That was a, really a fiasco the last time we had to deal with that in the summer of 2011. You know, is there a new spirit of bipartisanship in congress right now? I'm not sure there is. One thing we do see, it is encouraging that we saw this deal happen before the stock market tanked so there is some awareness that these decisions really affect the real world and instead of waiting for the stock market to plunge and then having to rush and get something done, they seem to have done it in anticipation of that so that it doesn't happen. That will be the same scenario when we get to the debt ceiling because that is a much more serious problem that would have immediate impact. If there is sensitivity to the markets when we come around to that it could help get a deal done. I'm not too sure that is how it is going to play out. 

[00:47:33]


>> You mentioned getting it done before the markets had a chance to react. They still pushed it to the 11th hour. The senate was voting at 2:00 am on new year's day. Why do they wait until the very last minute to try to get these things done? 
>> People who have been watching these fiscal cliff negotiations for a long time basically expected it to play out pretty much the way it played out. There was not much real expectation that any grand bargain would happen because this is still a lame duck session of congress and the fact is in these negotiations neither side has maximum leverage until it's right up to the very last second. So that's when everybody feels they have the best ability to exact the demands that will satisfy their constituents and as a result it just really is not in either side's interest to make an agreement before you get to the last second because that is when everybody feels they have the most leverage. And we're going to see the same dynamic again with these other issues, most notably the debt ceiling coming in a couple months. 
>> Thank you very much for your perspective. Happy new year. 
>> Same to you. 
>>> Well the house action is about to officially begin so don+t go anywhere. from Is bigger than we think ... like the flu. With aches, fever and chills- the flu's a really big deal. So why treat it like it's a little cold? There's something that works differently than over-the-counter remedies. Prescription TAMIFLU attacks the flu virus at its source. So don't wait. Call your doctor right away. TAMIFLU is prescription medicine for treating the flu in adults and children one year and older whose flu symptoms started within the last two days. Before taking TAMIFLU tell your doctor if you're pregnant, nursing. have serious health conditions, or take other medicines. If you develop an allergic reaction, a severe rash, or signs of unusual behavior, stop taking TAMIFLU and call your doctor immediately. Children and adolescents in particular may be at an increased risk of seizures, confusion or abnormal behavior. The most common side effects are mild to moderate nausea and vomiting. The flu comes on fast, so ask your doctor about TAMIFLU. Prescription for flu. dad! I'm here to unleash my inner cowboy... Instead I got heartburn.

>>> Just minutes from now the house will convene with one major issue on the agenda. The fiscal cliff deal passed by the senate? Will hard line conservatives make it sxwobl in back now is reid wilson and ryan grim. Thank you for coming back. 

[00:51:58]


>> Hey. 
>> Thanks for having us. 
>> Do you think this bill will pass the houshgs and if not will democrats preferred to make further concessions? 
>> I think it will pass the house eventually. This is one of those moments, though, when I think speed is probably on the side of -- or, rather, it would benefit those who want to pass this bill. The faster you're able to get something to the floor and get it through a vote, the more likely you are to attract these conservatives and liberals, by the way, who might otherwise find a reason to vote against it. If the longer they take their time to sort of talk it through and go through the bill's details moment by moment, the more you'll get pressure from the outside and pressure from groups like everybody from the progressive campaign committee on the left to the heritage action and for growth on the right. The outside influences will only mount. If the house leaders have any ability to get this to the floor quickly, that would behoov the bill's chances. 
>> Ryan, what kind of a box do you think this puts house speaker john boehner into? Does he have the votes, and is he willing to risk his speakership to get a deal done? 
>> I think his speakership is safe because there are enough senate republicans that supported this bill that it's not as if john boehner is going it alone and kind of taking his party off some liberal cliff, so -- and the fact that eric cantor and paul ryan are all involved with it with the whipping here and everybody is pushing together, it makes it so there isn't anybody else they could really turn to, so I think he is safe. I think the question isn't actually whether this will pass the house. It's when. The house republicans revolted on the payroll tax holiday about a year ago after the senate had done something very similar, something like 90-91. A couple of days later after the market reacted, they came become and they caved. Even if they do manage to spike this, it will be merely symbolic and they'll come back and they'll pass it again because i don't see harry reid accepting any type of amended version of this. I think this is a take it or leave it offer to the house, and if they vote to leave it today, they're going to he wanted up voting to take it tomorrow or the day after. 

[00:54:14]


>> And, reid, you're take on that? If we don't get a bill out of the house the president has promised wait until the new congress is sworn in on january 4th and start the process all over again, so do you think the odds of a deal go up or down with the new congress? 
>> Well, I think we're going to get the deal before the new congress comes in, but I think in the end of the day the odds probably increase given democratic gains in the last election. One of the interesting things, though, is this sort of discussion of the market's reaction and whether or not a big drop in the market like what happened after the tarp bill failed might spur people to action. We haven't really seen the market reacting that much. Sure, it was down five days in a row last week to the week between christmas and new year's, but it was up significantly yesterday, and who knows if we get a deal, it might go up if this bill looks like it's going to pass, it will go up a little bit. That tells me there's this sort of new york-d.C. Disconnect here. One side sees a deal that can be completed, and that's not how politics works anymore. If a deal doesn't go through by tomorrow morning, I'm not so pessimistic that we're going to see some type of steep drop. If the deal fails, though, then I think we're back to that moment in september, october of 2008 when the dow dropped 777 points in a single day. 
>> All right. Reid wilson, ryan grim, thank you both. We're just moments away from the house beginning their debate on this. Well, thank you so much for watching. Keep it right here on msnbc as the house officially gets back to work and, of course, happy new year to all. Coverage continues on the fiscal cliff vote here on msnbc, the place for politics. 

[00:58:58]


>>> We have breaking news right now on msnbc. The house of representatives is reconvening to consider the fiscal cliff deal. Overwhelmingly approved by the senate in the wee hours of this new year. Republicans meet at 1:00. The democrats are said to be going in now and that vice president joe biden who, of course, was key in making the senate deal happen, will be in that caucus, we're told. Big questions, though, still outstanding. When might the house vote on this deal? Can speaker boehner come up with the votes to pass it? Or will republicans try to amend it and end send it back. Good day. Happy new year. I'm chris jansing. There are a lot of moving parts on capitol hill. Let's get right to nbc's luke russert who is on the hill and where things stand. First, let's listen into the start of this session.

You could be an outlaw. I'm not really someone who goes off the grid, Nick. Whoo-hoo! I'm off the grid! I'm so far off the grid, thatrybody's all, "She's off the grid!" And then I'm all, "I don't play by your rules. I can drink at 11:00... a.m. Yeah, that backfired pretty quickly. High five.

Oh, now it isa mustache. You look adorable. Winston, I need you to be honest with me, okay? Yeah. Does your mother not like me? Yes. She does, she does not like me? Schmidt, she loves you. Good, good, because, you know, historically speaking, I'm like, catnip to tough-talking African-American women. It's 'cause I don't front, know what I mean? Don't do that. A'ight. What is that?

Oh, hey, Winston, you know, you can just have the hummus in there, okay? It's giving me the toots. Hey, Schmidt. Hey, Alisha. You look great. Wow. Thanks. It's like they stretched the ugly out of Winston. Hmm. How's the hoops? Good, it's good. Yeah? Very impressive, pro ball. I mean, women's pro, but still. Swoosh. I was working in real estate, but I got laid off, so... I got laid off last week! I don't even know what to do with myself. I just told myself it was a chance to start over. Yes.

I'm gonna have to Shaq attack her. Schmidt. May I have your blessing? 'Cause I'm gonna be, like, dribbling up the court. Schmidt. Boom. Technical foul. Boom. Illegal use of the hands. Boom. Hello, Schmidt. Charmaine. Charmaine! The loft just became Big Mama's House! Give me a hug. You gonna take care of this? He's dead to me. Okay. Hi. Excuse me. Are you Katie? I'm Sam from Cupid Match. And I'm the girl from my dreams of you. You are Katie, right? Yeah. Finally. I am. I'm Katie. Hi.

Hi. So many e-mails back and forth. How's the little dog of yours? I had to put her-im down on the way here. Oh, my God! I know. Can I tell you something? Uh, not really. I'm you from the future. Well, that's a first. Nick, I traveled from the future to find you. I'm a time traveler. Does everybody tip badly in the future, or is it just you? You don't believe I'm you, do you? Absolutely not. Well, I know you didn't shower this morning. Well, good guess. It's a Wednesday. I know a girl broke your heart and you gave up on love. I know sometimes you get mad and you don't know why. I know you're a bartender because you like three feet of bar between you and everyone you meet. Well, I mean... Chew on that, you clown. Wait. Hey, don't-don't say all that weird stuff and then just leave! You were wrong about the bar! But everything else was right. What was the band that we...? I know... I'm in.

Nobody. You're the first person I've told, obviously. Whoa. If I find out how you die, do you want me to tell you? Don't worry. I already know. It's one of these moles.

Only thing is, he thinks my name is Katie. And that I'm a dancer and/or something involving puppets. Sam: Katie? Katie: Hey, Sam. These are my roommates. Hey. Hey, uh, Katie, we're running late for dance rehearsal. Yes. Oh. We're wondering if we're

I'd love to see you leap. Don't get self-conscious now. You've got this. You've got it. You're really getting a show here, 'cause he normally doesn't do this for a private audience. Do the tribal stuff. All right. Yeah. SCHMIDT: Beautiful. SAM: Is he okay? I'm kind of hearing some popping. Schmidt: No, no, Look at that vert. Breathtaking. Faster. Faster. Schmidt: Grasshopper. And I'm done. All right, you know what? I'm gonna go to a couple brunches, maybe take a nap, rehydrate. Come here. (grunts) Nick: This is so normal. This isn't upsetting at all. Yah!

I love being Katie. Vintage Katie. Like an animal you are. Katie knows how the sausage gets made. Ew. Katie... has a job, y'all. I think I should just stay Katie. Maybe you should watch a cautionary tale that I like to call The Nutty Professor. What's Katie gonna do, Nick? She's got some pretty dark needs. Well, I hope you don't like him, 'cause you're not coming back from, "Just kidding. My name is actually Jess." (phone chimes) "Hey, I got your number from Nick. Want to hang?" What's this? I gave your number to the guy that you like from the bar. You asked me to. Oh, my God. I forgot. I've never had two guys into me before. What's happening? Jess, I'm gonna tell you what's happening.

What? And then there's you, who has this raw animal magnetism just dropped in her lap like a sack of taters. What a waste. I'm pretty sure it is not a waste. Oh, it's a waste. Jess, look, you don't have the skill to juggle men. You wear a cardigan on top of another cardigan. We all know you're not the best with doorknobs. You can barely hold one thing in each hand. You tripped the other day just standing there. What's happening? Okay, but Katie can juggle men. She's out the door before you even know your wallet's gone, son. (phone chimes) Ooh. He wants to cook for me. Is there a hot way of saying I don't feel sexy after I've had a lot of cheese? I would say no. WINSTON (whistles): Didn't know this was a butter knife type of place.

Jess: Andy and I have been sending each other some pretty dirty texts. Come to the professor. Let me see. He says, "Can't stop thinking about what you're gonna wear tonight." How do I respond? With a simple... Mm-hmm. "Or not wear." Okay. Okay? "Or not wear because sex happens naked." Send. Okay, let me help you with that. "Just kidding. Get ready for a night you will never forget." Okay?

(phone rings) Oh, my God, phone's ringing. Oh. Got to take this. I'm so sorry, it... No, no, no, I... It's very important. I'll just be cooking. I love cooking. It's my only outlet. Nick, Nick. You gave my number to the wrong guy. Wait, which one did you want me to give your number to? Andy. Andy is so boring. Bearclaw just told me a ten minute joke about squirrels with the punch line, "eat these nuts." Seriously, he is so awesome. Nick, I don't want to hurt his feelings. Tell me what to do because you got me into this mess; this is your fault. This is not my fault. I just wanted you to stop cleaning the kitchen so much, Jess. (phone chimes) Oh, my God. Who's Katie? I'm Katie. What is happening? Hey, mama bear. Hey. Yeah. Can I tell you some... thing? Me first. Um, when Nick... When Nick told me that you wanted my number, I was all like... (bellows) And then I was like, Nick, this might be the best thing that ever happened to me. Now you go. Um... what I was gonna say was, um... You're... an old soul. Hey, I wanted.... I wanted to tell you. When I, uh, I got your text from before, and I have figured out my sex character. And it's Sergeant Giddyap Carruthers. Hey, if we... if we make love later, and I tell you to pretend that I'm a scary ghost, are you gonna be weirded out by that? Bearclaw, I'm sick. Oh. 

[00:20:21]


In my... face. Oh, no, um, I've got an anal thermometer in my bag. I'm really good atelling myself, and I think that I'm... I feel very feverish. I don't think I need the thermometer. Oh, yeah. No, you do feel hot. Yeah. Now you feel even hotter. Alisha, have a drink with me. Schmidt, I only go out with guys who play basketball. Well, let's play for it. I win, you have a drink with me. You win, I take you to brunch. Shoot me. Schmidt, I'm a professional basketball player. Yeah, and I'm a guy who works in marketing that wants to give it to you. We both have jobs; get over it. Do I ever finish writing my zombie book? Z is for Zombie? Great title. Do we ever get rich and famous? Three words: hot, air, balloon. Do we invent them? No, they've been invented. Jess or Katie? Not now, Nicks. Hey, tell her you're sorry. What for? You'll find out. I mean, I'm sure I did something stupid, but what did I do? You just tell her you're sorry. What did I do? You did something stupid. So tell her you're sorry. Now I know why people get annoyed with me. It's hard to talk to us. Hey, you know, I can't believe she asked Nick for your number and then... Yeah, yeah, you know what, man? We-We're perfect together. It's like I finally found my lady bear. See, I felt like we had a connection, too. You know, I don't know if you ever get that feeling likeke, I don't know, like maybe I could marry this woman. Oh, God. (gasps) Is there a woman in that bathroom being harmed? No. I don't buy it.

There it is. Hey, guys. Pay up, gentlemen. She's sitting on the couch. Yeah, right, you won. Let me get a four. Mm-hmm. TGIFmarathon tonight. What? Both: I can't take this anymore. What is happening? I've actually been working on something. A r??sum??, maybe? (chuckles) (?? la Steve Urkel): Did I do that? I'm sorry. Did you just say you were working on that? It's Urkel! Urkel? JESS (chuckling): Urkel. Urkel, Jess? It's funny. Okay, look, it is perfectly fine to watch TV all day. No, it is not. No, it's not. But Urkel?! Come on. Not even in my darkest moments did I do Urkel. Guys, that's crazy. This is objectively hilarious. I can do any character from an '80s sitcom. Quiz me. No. Oh, Alf, don't eat the cat! Get out of the city, Cousin Larry Appleton. I'm Frasier Crane. No! Jess, the men in suits here, the professionals, would like to know what the plan is. I'm a professional, too, pal. You're not. Please, you work in a bar. It's a whole different thing. I respect you. Just, please. I don't know what the plan is, Schmidt, but I love working at the Casserole Shanty. Today I got a locker, and in 18 months, I'm gonna roll into some sweet dental coverage. So, yeah, my job pretty much rules. Low on bean! Low on bean! I repeat: I'm low on bean! I'm good on bean! Would you like to know what I did at my job all day today? Don't say "crushed it." I'm gonna go with "crushed it." Funny enough, uh, I crusheit. I crushed it all day today, and then I crushed it some more. And then it asked me what I was doing, and I told it that I was crushing it. That's what I do on a daily basis, Jess. You used to inspire me. I mean, not specifically-- because I find teaching to be icky-- but, you know, in a vague kind of "Look at that go-getter in a... in a brightly colored sweater" kind of way. What happened to the inspiring, visor-less Jess? (knocking) Hey, maybe that's her. Hey, we just moved in across the hall. 

[00:02:01]


I'm Chaz. This is Fife, Sutton and Brorie. What's up? Schmidt. Any-turds, just wanted to give you a heads up that we're having some people over to hang tonight and it might get a little loud. I like where your head is at. We're gonna be there with bells on. Dolla-dolla bells, y'all. (snickers) Well, it's just going to be a bunch of young people. So... Hi. I live here, too. What are you names? Schmidt! 
??? Who's that girl?    Who's that girl?    It's Jess.    ??????
So, when he said, "It's just going to be a bunch of young people," well, he must have meant, "You," meaning me, fellow young person, "You'll feel right at home. And you two walking corpses, stay away." You're six months younger than me, Schmidt. You're a corpse for sure. Behold. This actuarial table stops at age 99. But if you track my current trajectory, I'm clearly gonna live till I'm 123 years old, so... (robot voice): hello, robot sex. Is this accurate? No, no, no, Winston, I spend $49.95 a month on a subscription to an inaccurate real-time actuarial service. Then I think I may have died four years ago. Oh, yeah? That sucks. "African-American male, life expectancy: 67 years"? Sounds about right. "Minus one year if you frequently question your career choice." Check. "Minus one year if your chosen field offers few opportunities for advancement." Check and double check. Nick: I like getting older. I feel like I'm finally aging into my personality. Keep this crap out of my yard! (ice cream truck music playing) And turn that nonsense down! They never did get that Frisbee back. I used that Frisbee as a dish. (chuckles) JESS: Seriously? I used it for pistachios in my room. SCHMIDT: Not only am I the youngest person in this loft, I'm also the most successful. Oh! Shut up, Schmidt. Are you honestly measuring yourself like a little boy? I'm sorry that you're not growing anymore like me. And apparently, I'm gonna be growing forever. 

[00:04:02]


I'm like a Jewish Peter Pan. Petya Pan. Peiter Pan. Pesach Pan. Why don't you take it down a notch before this old man takes you outsidand makes you pick a switch? I'm like Snow Leopard. You guys are like DOS. And as your elder, can I give you a little advice, Schmidt? Can we talk for a sec? Sure. Yes, yes. 'Cause you've kind of gotten under my skin a little bit. Shoot, Gran Torino. I'm gonna die so soon. Do you think that the neighbors will want, like, four individual casseroles or, like, one large party-size casserole? Yes, Jess, that's exactly what hip, trendy millennials want to eat: casserole. Now come on, guys, just tighten up, all right? Think young. What the hell is that smell? It's Old Spice. I'm smelling Old Spice? Yeah, and yes, it has "Old" in the title, and yes, it's all over my body. Okay, well, take it off. I'm wearing the Spice. The Spice is cool. It's not even a real spice, man. Take it off. The Spice is coming back! Everybody knows it! The guy on the horse! You can wear any spice. Don't wear Old Spice! Classic cologne fight. (overlapping shouting) Jess: Guys! Shh! Hi. Zander and Raj went to Pate's thing, so tonight's been notched down to a "chill hang." Cool. I'll just put these... Oh. Thanks for having us. No, can't do this. Schmidt: What is up? Have fun, kids. Party hip-hop. What's going on, kids? Let's party. What are you guys doing, huh? What is that? Is that Top Gun? Oh, look at that. Look at Anthony Eds, the "Goose" man. Unbelievable that he dies in a few scenes. Goose dies? Not cool, man. No, it's... Look, nobody does an onscreen death like Anthony Eds. He's like the Hilary Swank of bald men. He's like the Hilary Swank of bald... Hold everything. Is that Cass Shant? Casserole Shanty? That's where I work. Your chicken-broccoli totally fuels my night bikes. I'm very happy to help. Some of my friends don't appreciate it. Fife: No. You're just figuring it out, just like us. Yeah. Yeah. I amfiguring it out. Thank you, Brorie. I am. I'm just figuring it out, and that's okay. 

[00:06:04]


What do you guys do? I work at home. I'm a DJ. Well... Was I unclear about my night bikes? I work for a single-national corporation called Associated Strategies. Moo... (laughs) Oh, moo... I know. Yeah. Totally, Fife. I get that. Moo... Moo...! (laughs) Right? That's a thing, right? Yeah? Moo? Schmidt, you don't know... Jess. (?? la Steve Urkel): Did I do that?

Hey, Nana, Pop-Pop. You missed an unreal hang last night. Unreal with a capital "uh." Winston: Really? Those kids with the found furniture and no TV because it's cool? It's a different world over there. A world where it's okay to only have a part-time job. A world where it's okay that I'm still finding myself. A world where I have not one, but two catchphrases. 500. (gasps) (?? la Stephanie Tanner): How rude! (all laugh) How rude! Just take it! They think I made those up. There's just one tiny hitch. It's very awkward, and I don't know how to say it... They hate Schmidt. So much. How did you know? If I had a dollar for everybody I couldn't hang out with because they hated Schmidt, I'd be rich. Like, fill my gas tank all the way up rich. He was all over the map. He spent 20 minutes talking about aioli. Don't worry about it. I'm on it. What do you mean, you're on it? You're gonna prank him, aren't you? I-I knew it! I knew it! You're gonna prank him. Hey, can I help you? I'm really good with pranks? You may not help with the pranks. Why not, man? I'm the best with the pranks, man. They call me "Prank Sinatra." No, you call you Prank Sinatra. Oh, come... 'Cause I am. Winston, you're the worst at pranks in the whole world. No, I'm not. Yes, you are! You either go way too small... (whispering): Hey. Let's pour a little juice near her shoe. ...or you go way too big. Hey, let's hit her in the throat with a ski. You don't have a pranking sweet spot. Speaking of... Are you limping? My hip is achy. I wonder if it's your shoes. Did you try different shoes? I try on four different pairs of shoes with every outfit, rain or shine. You know that. What did you do? Well, he could try on 100 different pairs. It's not going to matter. The left heel is an eighth of an inch shorter on every singlpair. (both laugh) This is so crazy, Nick. Oh, my God, you know what we should do? We should take those shavings, and then sprinkle them by his car. 

[00:11:14]


Let me just get this clear. Take the little bit of dust Yeah, 'cause... and go outside and put it near his car? Yes. That's not a prank. Yes, it is. That's just kind of littering. His whole ride to work, Okay, you're done. he'd be thinking, like, "What?" So we're pranking him so he thinks while we're not around, "What?" It's too small. You've got to go bigger than that. Well, anyway, I got to fill this up with pee. Ew! Why? So I can pour it all over Schmidt's bed and make him think he's incontinent. That's disgusting, Nick. Hey, sometimes up close, art is ugly. I got an idea. Instead of urine, we use acid. (laughing): And put it on his face! All right? Jess, do these pants seem long to you? Nick picked them up from the dry cleaner for me today, and I don't know, I swear they seem longer. I think your pants look fine. Okay, Jess, tonight, you're obviously gonna want to follow my lead. I don't know how to tell you this... Actually, I do: Um, they hate you. That's crazy. It iscrazy... how much they hate you. Watch. Every time you say something, they're gonna change the subject immediately. That's how you tell if people hate you. I'm pretty sure I know how to crush it with the kids. (indistinct chatter and laughter) Schmidt: Watch this. Hey, guys. Schmidt: What up, yo? Throw your damn hands up. We hanging out tonight? Jess, I love your hair. It is so good today. Yeah! Thank you! Flowy. Yes. Really curly. What do you guys think about the length of my sideburns? It's new. Daring or gauche? I got my plane ticket home for Easter. Thank you for reminding me, Jess. Yeah. No, of course. I've got, like, a little calendar thing. You know, I've got a great, um... I've got a great plane ticket guy that you... We're having another hang tonight Jess. Got some chokes, hula hoops, sitar. You should come over. Yeah! Yeah, no, like, that's the best idea. Totally. 

[00:13:14]

Oh, hey, I got to... I got to take this. Ferguson? Is that you? (exhales) Yeah, t-tonight? Well, I mean... I made plans with...

Man, I've never seen you work this hard at anything, ever. That's because I care so much. I set an alarm for 5:00 a.m. so I could switch Schmidt's fiber pills with placebos. Damn it, I want to care about something as much as you care about ruining Schmidt's life. NICK: And where have you been all night, yog lady? Jumping around to your hippity-hop? Taking your drug pills and smoking your hash stick? I'm actually asking-- I'm not doing a thing right here. Those guys are so much fun. Now,w, if you'll excuse me, I've been up for 48 hours, so I'm gonna just sleep off an ass-ton of quinoa. No, there's no time for sleep! Guys, here's what we got to do. We got to find the passion that we have in life, and we got to hold on to it. You're so right. Just like-- I can't believe I'm saying this-- just like Nick Miller. Why, look at that. I've never been an inspiration before. I don't like it. It's too much responsibility. Ooh, ay-ay-ay. I am cons-to-the-pizzo. Hmm? Constipated. I'm constipated. Surprising. Here, sit down, relax, watch some TV. What's the chair doing over here? Just moved it. (sighing): Oh... gosh. (TV audio playing quietly) Turn it down, man! Turn it down! Turn it... What? It's too loud! Schmidt, you're blasting the TV, you maniac! You can hear that? It's blasting, Schmidt! Jess is trying to sleep! You can hear this? Uh, yes. Well, you know what, you were right. They hate me, and I know why they hate me, too. It's because I'm old, and they're the future of humanity, a pan-ethnic, pan-sexual hive mind, and they want nothing to do with me. They're not thatgreat, Schmidt. Last night, Chaz and Sutton got in a fight. A lovers' quarrel? Sutton and Chaz are not a couple. Chaz is with Fife; Brorie's with, uh... the other broad. Actually, Brorie, Sutton and Fife are in a triad, and Chaz is a floater. They're poly-amorous? Damn it! (sighs) Jess, you've got to help me help them forget how old I am. (laughs) You're not old. Then how do you explain this? Use your legs, buddy. Let me show you something. Gonna hurt your back. 

[00:19:44]


Look at this-- I'm freaking shrinking! I took a photo of the wall, shrunk it down, made a copy at an architect's office. From there, it was just your basic spackle-and-silkscreen job. I don't care, but... yay. It's a weird life, but it's where I'm at right now. Okay. (groans) (sighs) Jess... this is the hardest thing I've ever had to say. Please help me be cool. Say that one more time. Oh. Visor-wearing Jess, will you please help me be cool? 
???   ??????
Okay, listen up, I got 3.5 years to live. I can't be an assistant anymore. I don't want to die. I want to work. Honestly, I want to work here. But I got to follow my passion, much like a running back would want when given the ball, and in the game of life, this job is the pigskin. And damn it, I'm in the red zone! And in summation, I feel... very good about what I just said. Hopefully, you do, too. 
???   ??????
(door opens) Who wants to start an arcade fire? Schmidt. What? What are you doing? This is not the outfit we talked about. What? Rock and roll. You way overshot it. Look at that. I'm being ironic. That's not ironic; that's just a bad pun. And what are you doing here? Your arms are hot, but your neck is cold? Schmidt: Hey, look at me. If you guys keep a tight core, you can... your burpees can look like this, too. When's the Olympics? Right, guys? I'm gonna set a PR tonight. Well, you know, he's not... he's not... Parkour. Oh! Oh! You got beer on her, man. (quietly): Did I do that? Don't worry, my mom can throw that dress in with my laundry next time she's here. 

[00:21:45]


(laughing): Sorry. Your mom does your laundry? Washer-dryer kind of freaks me out, you know? It's just, like, eh... washa-washa-washa, guh-guh, guh-guh, uh-guh-guh-guh. On the nose. Okay, you know what? It's fine. I'll-I'll wash it myself. All right. Thank you, though. Sutton: She's so iconoclastic and modern. And she even got our dishwasher to work. I remember. JESS: You know, I mean, I just... it wasn't that big a deal. It was just... I just... I just turned it on. There was a button that said "on." It's weird how the dishwasher just lives under the counter. How come there's no dish-dryer? Fife: Or un-washer. Oh, my God, you guys, are wethe dish un-washers? Chaz: Why don't we just move to Prague? I need to focus on my art. You can totally focus on your art in Prague. CHAZ: If we move to Prague, should I paint my nails black again? ! Hey, you guys, um... I can't hang out with you anymore. Why not? Because... our entire relationship's built on a lie. Jess, what are you talking about? I did not make up... "Did I do that?" Jess, please don't... I have to introduce you to a... Don't do it. little, adorable African-American nerd. Don't press the button. Don't... (electronic tones play) Schmidt: Jess, why would you do this to us? Who's "Steve Urclee"? wish ipads... To practice math more? I love math! But two ipads means two data plans? That's crazy. Maybe not. With at&t mobile share, adding an ipad is just $10 a month. But honestly, mom and dad's love is all i really need. We should keep these for us. We should keep these. What?! [ Male Announcer ] AT&T MOBILE SHARE. Add an ipad for just $10 a month. One plan10 devices. At&t. Rethink possible. combos bucks. Try our new southwestern mac and cheese with grilled chicken, served with soup or salad. Chili's lunch combos. Starting at 6 bucks. More life happens here. 

[00:25:12]


Jess, what the hell was that? You were supposed to teach me how to be cool. You did a terrible job. Look what I'm wearing. You didn't listen to anything I said! I told you to stop trying so hard. I will never stop trying. I don't care if I have to do a billion burpees. That is how you crush-- you never give up. That is the difference between me and you, Jess. (sighs) Is that what you think? You think I just gave up? Well... I was fired, Schmidt. Do you think I wanted to stop teaching? That's why I liked hanging out with those kids-- 'cause they weren't judging me all the time for not crushingit. Okay... Do you think that I want to work at the Casserole Shanty? Do you know what the people I work with call it? The Ass-erole Shanty. (both laugh softly) Just don't stop teaching. I mean, there's got to be something. I don't know, driver's ed, CPR... Uh... A smile class. My life sucks so much right now. But at lst I'm not 23. At least I own a trash can. At least I can legally rent a car. At least I don't live in a loft with three other... But you live with us. But I live you with guys. (knocking) Jess? We don't care if you stole your catchphrase from some low-budget Web series. We still want to hang out. (coughing loudly, spits) (sniffs, clears throat) Don't trust your government, kids. Oh, my God, it's the old man from the stairs. I thought he died. Let's get out of here before his robe opens. He's gonna get his old on you! Get out while you can! Hey, hey, Charles, the decrepit thing that just walked by, now, thatis old, okay? And you can hate him for being old, but you cannot hate me. We don't hate you for being old. We hate you 'cause you're a viciously unbearable ass-head. Seriously? (sighs) That's... Come here, that's... Get off! Ass-head! Ass-head! Yeah! I'm not gonna drink it all. Guys, I... am an ass-head. 

[00:27:13]


They don't hate me because I'm old. They hate me because of my personality. I can totally change my personality. Congratulations, Schmidt, that is... that's weird news. Winston: Ladies and gentlemen, you are looking at a brand-new man. A man who has proved so capable of talking about so little for so long... is now the producer of his very own sports talk show. No way! What?! That's right. That's right. Yeah, baby! It's halftime in America! Man, that's amazing! (laughing) Thank you, thank you, thank you. 2:35 to 5:35 a.m. Boom! Prime time for truckers! (imitates truck horn blowing) That's awesome. He's got something. Yes. In other news, I just spent three days trying to impress people who don't own bed frames. Well, if it makes you feel any better, I spent the last three days pouring urine on a grown man's sheets. Can you imagine how much we would get done if we just focused our energy onto something a little bit more worthwhile? Not to mention the money we would save. I know. Wait, what money? I mean, I've been running the numbers on this, but, you know, I think I spent... you know, $1,200 to $1,300. What?! On these pranks, yeah. What?! And I was under- budget, so... Under-budget? What, you think fake contact lenses are free? They are not, sister. Nick, you don't have that kind of money. I know I don't. Where are you gonna get that from? Doesn't matter. I had to prank Schmidt. (laughing): And I did. (exhales) Holy crap. I need a real job. Yeah, you do. Don't you ever prank me! Of course. You got it. You'll never see it coming. This is like the end of a horror movie. Or the beginning of a pranking movie. There are no pranking movies. Yet. Get out of here. (whispers): You'll never see it coming. Captioning sponsored by 20th century fox television and TOYOTA. Captioned by Media Access Group at WGBH access.wgbh.org This prescription is blurry. Hi, Schmidt. Is that you in tailored, grown-up clothing? Yeah. Mama's gonna ride this blazer all the way to a tutoring job. Thank goodness. I almost thought I was gonna have to loan you money. Well, I said tutoring job, 

[00:29:13]


not venture capitalist. Proud of you nonetheless. Thanks. (sighs quietly) What the hell? Okay. Alright, Nick, very funny. Quite the prankster you are. Ha! I'm gonna hit your ass with a ski! Winston? Get some.

>> I'm an american. I'm not going apologize for being a proud american. 
>> That's the picture kathy sent me and told me to show it to david gergen in the midst of our election coverage.

>> No one's here but telemundo so stop acting like, whoo -- 
>> let's go to gary tuchman, he's in eastport, maine. Gary, what's going on? 
>> Reporter: It's 9 degrees, they got 12 inches of snow last night, but it's a small town family. We're in eastport, maine, the eastern most city in the united states, we're half a mile from new brunswick, a providence in canada. This is an international celebration. Not only are we between two country, but we're between two time zones. Canada celebrates the new year 11:00 eastern time, which is midnight atlantic time. That maple leaf, may, the times square ball has nothing on this maple leaf. Can see right here this is the real canadian mounty, who is here for the celebration with his little girl. And you participated in the lowering of the maple leaf? 

[00:33:31]


>> First time this year, yes. 
>> Reporter: And you're going to sing "o 'canada," right? 
>> Sing it, sweetie. ?????? O' canada ?????? 
>> isn't that beautiful? 
>> That's what's going to happen at 100. Then at 12:00 midnight, get this, into the a maple leaf. It's the new years here on the eastern time zone. They lower a sardine because this used to be the sardine capital of the united states. So you can see, anderson and kathy, this is not times square, there are not millions of people here, but this lab very warm and fun international celebration. Back to you. 
>> I like that, gary. We'll check in with you a little bit later. Gary normally does the fun run, which I know you're a huge fan of. 
>> Let's break it down. This isn't my first barbecue with tuchman. I love gary tuchman. Obviously you are angry with him, to send him ground hog day style to some sort of town in maine where he drops a minnow in a bucket, is that some kind of ratings grabbing? 
>> It's americana. 
>> I love when you act like you know americana because I think some fois gras just fell out of your taffy. You referred to your private parts, which you referred to as your presents. 
>> The crowd is getting excited. 
>> Why wouldn't they be getting excited? We have the back street boy, new kids on the block and 98 degrees reunion. 

[00:35:31]


>> No. No, they don't have reunion. We're going to be back shortly with new year's tradition, where they drop a drag queen named sushi. We'll take to you key west after the break. Later? 
>> We have o direction singing "what makes you beautiful," their number one song of the year. 
>> Is that the number one song of the year? Really? 
>> Yes. 
>> How could I have not heard that song? 
>> There's the song. 
>> Do people listen to one direction? I know little kids do. Do adults? 
>> People love that song because it's sensitive. The lyrics are "you're insecure, don't know what for, you're turning heads when you walk through the door, don't need the make-up, being the way you are is enough." 
>> You know what's sad? You were pretending to read the card but you know that. 
>> That was my journal entry from last night. 
>> David petraeus and one direction live. 
>> They let honey boo boo stay up late. 
>> HOW'd U GET THAT ONE? You scored honey boo boo? She fell asleep on dr. Drew. I begged for jane velez-mitchell. First of all, she's a former addict. I don't know if she mentioned it in five minutes. She used to have a mullet. Now she has something more fancy free. And she's been through a lot. She's been dumpster diving. She's a freegan. Down what that is? 
>> Yes. Sort of. No, I don't. 
>> It's a movement where people want free food. It's for people going green. It's one of the issues that jane velez-mitchell covers that frankly you don't have the taffy to cover, stretchy taffy, christmas presents. 
>> By the way, it's not just honey boo boo but also her mom and chubs and pumpkin. 
>> What about chick a de? 
>> One of the kids. 
>> When your mom used to call you chubs, was that hard? I know that was your nickname throughout your first 40 years. Have I said the part yet no matter what you'll never live up to your mother? 

[00:37:33]


>> No. She's watching tonight. 
>> Oh, my god, high, chloe! Your mom blew me off this week. The quote was, darling, I'm tired, I was up dancing all night with the fabulous michael feinstein. And you know she wasn't lying. 
>> We're going to take a quick break. We'll be right back. More with kathy griffin and the hundreds of thousands of people in times square. 
>> Rihanna live. 
>> Not live. 
>> Happy new year!

>>> We're here in times square. The south korean game, what is his name, psy? 
>> Is this the part where I'm supposed to pretend this isn't happening? 
>> No. It's being performed for everyone in times square. 
>> That guy hates america. That's why you should keep watching us. We're going to have him up here with general petraeus singing gangnam style. I can't throw a stone without running into him. He's the mc hammer of south korea. 
>> Really? 
>> Yeah. 
>> You heard it here. 
>> I want to say your new besty, the boo boo, mama tweeted me and said she's excited to call in and talk to anderson cooper and kathie lee. No, no, be on side. Be on my side. 

[00:42:01]


>> I'm on your side. 
>> That can't be the first time that happened. 
>> You're acting like you're listening to me but you're dancing the gangnam style. 
>> I'm never danced the gangnam style. 
>> What is the gangnam style? 
>> I have no idea. 
>> Are we in a gangnam? Miley cyrus loves to throw gangnam signs. What do you think about her hair cut? 
>> I love the new hair cut. 
>> Is that why you went out and got it the same day. 
>> You, miley cyrus and susan pouter all have the same hair cut. 
>> Susan pouter? 
>> I'm bringing her back. 
>> Who is the current president pro tem of the u.S. Senate? 
>> Patrick leahy? 
>> Yes. 
>> Thank you. Good night, everybody. 
>> Not good night. We have rihanna making out with chris brown in seven minutes. Rihanna is going to have sex with chris brown here in seven minutes. 
>> Let's check in with sanjay. I know you were concerned the fun run wasn't going to get covered this year. 
>> I'm sorry, my pelvic exam. 
>> Sanjay, it's a midnight race. Are you ready for this? I know did you a triathlon this year. You're in good shape. Are you ready for this midnight run? 
>> Reporter: I think so, anderson. I mean, you know, the things i do for this company I can't even begin to tell you. But this is the midnight run. About 5,000 people here. This race, as you may know, has been going on every year since 1979. At midnight there's going to be a bunch of fireworks up here in the sky. People from all over the world come in for this run. It's my first year doing this particular run, it's about 30 degrees outside. We're about 30 blocks north of where you are. I'm actually looking forward to this. We have a lot of people from time warren, the fit nation program actually starting as well. A few hundred people joining us from them as well. People have costumes on. I don't know if she's running or not but a lot of people here are, anderson. Kathy. 

[00:44:33]


>> Ryan! Ryan, screw you! We did a better broadcast because we improvise and we're real! 
>> You're on tv. 
>> Hello. That was ryan seacrest behind us. 
>> I love that you were just screaming obscenities at psy and he can't even hear you. 
>> I love that me ear piece fell out and you don't even care. You don't want me to hear the booth. 
>> I don't know where your hair stops and -- 
>> neither do i. 
>> Well, put it in. 
>> I don't know where it is. 
>> I'll bring in john zarella -- 
>> seacrest would know exactly what to do. John, how are the crowds there? Looks like they're quite ready. 
>> The crowd is absolutely spectacular here in key west. Thousands of people waiting for what has become a huge tra -- tradition here, the annual drop of sushi, the drag queen. Sushi is going to drop from that red stiletto there right at midnight. Everybody is so happen to be on the show with you and kathy. And you've got to look at this, you'll have to explain this later, if you guys want to, but they made this sign up for you and kathy. "No nudity." So just be forewarned, that was for you guys and you can explain it if you feel like you want to. 
>> Every year we usually put a sign under the camera just to remind kathy no nudity -- 
>> this is great because there is some psy confetti is covering the letter on your teleprompter so you're free styling. 

[00:46:41]


>> Oh, I can -- I unplugged myself. 
>> I have a small baseball bat. I'm going to be honest. I got a tour of the white house. 
>> How did you -- 
>> I can't say. It's a friendship bender if i say. I'm going to admit that I did something that I think anyone would do, which is I think when I was there, I took a picture of myself in the bathroom at the white house. 
>> Really? 
>> That's who I am. 
>> Wow. Was this like the tour that anyone could get? 
>> No, this is super secret. I wasn't supposed to. 
>> Did you steal something? You took something, didn't you? 
>> Yes. I took so. As I was going in, I run into ed -- he's over at fox. 
>> He's a nut bag. 
>> You used to make fun of ed henry, every year he would be in hawaii for new years and he would do a lovely live shot in shorts and he would have a hula thing going on and you would mock him mercilessly. 
>> I did get an e-mail, he did invite me to the correspondent's dinner. 
>> By the way, that is the worst evening you could ever have in your entire life. I never go to that. I refuse to go to that. 
>> And I also have a picture of -- oh, I have a video -- i will do anything to promote "kathy" coming back to bravo january 10th live. So when I was in mexico -- this is a video. It's only 17 seconds. You're not going to see this on any other network, I promise you. 
>> A lot of people find me attractive. Some of them have four legs. "Kathy" thursdays on bravo. 

[00:48:44]


>> I like how you didn't even blurt out the "jimmy kimmel live" t-shirt I'm wearing. 
>> I was once doing a live shot with paula zahn and I was in sri lanka and a dog humped my leg all the way through the live shot. I started giggling and I was like, paula, I have to say i have a dog humping my leg. 
>> Is that how you lost your cherry? Did she find it amusing? 
>> She did not find if amazing. 
>> Did you know barbara walters is in st. Barts? Are you going on record as saying you think st. Barts is a third world country and you would not be caught dead there? 
>> No, I've been there but on new year's eve and all those people are there. 
>> That is so your crowd. He is so up in the jolie-pitt crowd. Let's talk about heros. Number one, not only was I not invited. 
>> What do you mean? 
>> They told me they didn't trust me. They said it came directly from you and that I was going to present something to a hero but they said if I wanted to mop up at a soup kitchen, they would send a crew. I am not making that up. 
>> That is not true. 
>> I feel I should have won hero of the year. 
>> For what? 
>> I should be more humble but this but I actually flew commercial to mexico and it was really hard because there were other people on the plane, i didn't even know. 

[00:51:30]


>>> The vote taking place on the u.S. Senate floor. 1:55 in the morning, on new year's day, an extraordinary scene as they vote on this fiscal deal which was finally reached between congressional leaders and the white house. After weeks of negotiations and days of back and forth and a lot of blame and finger-pointing and accusations and finally, an agreement was reached with the vice-president joe biden doing the negotiations there and pushing it through with the democrats and now a boat taking place on the senate floor. They're counting up the positives, those who boarded for and against it. We have the roll call and we are expecting this vote to pass. Possibly by 60 out of the 100 votes in the u.S. Senate. Let's listen to the proceedings. 
>> Mr. Nelson of nebraska, i. 
>> Mr. Paul, no. 

[00:53:49]


>> It is a slow process as we go through the votes in the senate. We heard harry reid earlier before saying that it will require a 60 though a majority. So far we have heard that when rand paul, the tea party republican senator from kentucky, has voted no. That has been the only no vote i have heard so far but there will be others. This deal is expected to pass the senate. Once it gets through the senate, it must then go to the house of representatives which will convene later today, tuesday. And the republican leadership in the senate, some confusion. Not entirely sure whether or not the republicans will in fact pass this bill. They said they will look at it, read it, they want to amend it and suggest changes. The me send it back to the senate. They may in fact vote on it and improve it. This is the first step. Once it goes there, there are still other issues, other budget issues which the u.S. Government and congress have to deal with. Literally they have to deal with the spending side of the question. Our cnn radio congressional correspondent is in washington watching the vote right now. I noticed rand paul voted no. Who else? 
>> There were several senators voting no. And to be honest, I was counting the yes votes. I wanted to see whether the boats pass and I can tell you there were 60 votes and the senate has passed the fiscal cliff deal. Other senators that were planning to vote no, I know there were multiple no votes. An overwhelming vote in the u.S. Senate in favor of the bill. 
>> What happens next? 
>> Right, so now this vote goes to the house. We expect house members to come in tomorrow morning, many probably will be start reading the bill right now. They will caucus especially the attention will be on house republicans. To see if they have the votes to pass the bill, if they need to get democrats to do it. There will be a lot of votes coming tomorrow. We don't know the schedule yet. There could be a vote in the house tomorrow, or today, rather, tuesday. As soon as they could pass it. That may take another day if not clear, they will wait until tomorrow morning or I guess, now that is only about seven hours to get some guidance from house leadership. Probably the next 12 hours we will see the next phase of this and we will know if the votes are there in the house to pass this bill or not. We can expect that the president will sign it very quickly. 

[00:56:35]


>> Watching the house floor, there seems to be centers shaking hands and backslapping going on. Thumb-sized plenty of this dl for all of them to hate. It seems no one is entirely happy with this deal. 
>> I think that is right. It is interesting that senators on both sides have said that openly. It is not a perfect deal. We know that we -- know this feel it is perfect but we believe it is much better than going over the fiscal cliff. As an option. We would much rather do that. That is something that happens in these deals that is very common at the trade-off that no one is happy with it. People say as long as no one is happy with it may be it is a good compromise. It remains to be seen how the american public does is it because it kicks some of these issues down the road, including the budget cuts facing most of american government. Reprieve for the budget cuts and it means the senate and house will again have to deal with budget cuts in two months. As you have been reporting, the same time they will have the debt ceiling hanging over their heads and also run around the same time when the last government spending bill will run out. They could face a government shutdown at that same time. It sets up another fiscal cliff. 
>> Explain to our international viewers who are not familiar with how this process works, why is it that the u.S. Congress and the white house and the entire process year continues to be set up for these confrontations. We have had a government shut down. We have had the debt ceiling debate. With the u.S. Lost its aaa credit rating because of what happened with the republicans refusing to improve on any debt ceiling. It seems like every couple of months there is some manufactured crisis which does a lot of harm to u.S. Credibility around the world. 

[00:58:37]


>> I know. Is something that I think it makes many of us who cover congress want to show colder air at times and some of the lawmakers as well. There are a lot of factors among them are the increasing amount of money in american politics that I think has changed the nature of campaigns and also changed the nature of lawmaking. When lawmakers got to the capital, these to be a culture here where they would sit down across the aisle once their work was done at the end of the day and spent time socially with each other. The recognized each other as people and often could become friends across the aisle. Now I think we see these sharp campaigns with tremendous amounts of spending. Leading to an incredibly warlike environment. It goes past the floor of the house and the senate and coast past these genuinely philosophical debates and get sometimes personal. It ends up in a divide that means many of our members are not looking at each other in a way that leads to compromise later. They are not seeing each other as potential friends or allies across the aisle. This is becoming a place where your goal is to try to knock down the other party. It has always been part of politics but now has become a dominant and I think that is one reason that we have reached so many of these crises recently. There has been so little room for compromise. 
>> For our viewers joining us right now, we are watching an extraordinary session of the u.S. Senate. At 2:00 in the morning on tuesday, january 1st, 2013, new ye's day, they reconvened about 30 minutes ago to hold what could be described as a very significant, maybe even historic vote on this deal to avoid the worst of the fiscal cliff. Plus it would have gone into effect the congressional leaders and now the vote on the senate floor. They didn't technically, if you like, win over the fiscal cliff but now they're having this vote. From here it goes to the house of representatives. Not entirely sure if it will pass or sail through the house of representatives there but it is expected that it is essentially a deal, should be paed by the house of representatives if not the coming hours, certainly in the coming days. That is the latest from washington. Up next for our viewers in the united states it's the new year's eve special with anderson cooper and kathy griffin. For the rest of us, it's "defining moments."

[01:03:57]


>> Yes. I said you have so much money, you're printing so much money you have money coming out of your butt and psy lovingly looked at us, after I'm talking smack and said that's love coming from you.

>> Woke up from a bizarre dream in which orsan wells was locked into negotiations on an island xanadu. As he left, he gave seacrest the key to a financial model of tv that would earn him billions. I've been hanging out with you too much I think. 
>> I actually do think I sent that to you, didn't i? 
>> You sent it to me.

>> It's true.

>> I don't know what that means. Zit like a coke joke. 
>> I don't know what you're talking about. I enjoy soda as well.

>> Reporter: We almost had a little accident a little while ago but the star of the show has arrived. Sushi is up in the shoe wearing lime green this year, anderson and kathy. Something to do with palm trees. I'm not sure exactly what. But this event gets bigger and bigger every year. At least 10,000 people here. Having fun? Yeah! Whoo! 
>> Whoo! 
>> Reporter: It is a great crowd. They are from all over the united states. Where are you from? 
>> Minnesota. 
>> Reporter: Minnesota? Cold up there. You're better here. You like it better down here? It's nice and warm. Anderson again, tremendous crowd on duval street here in key west. Probably at least 10,000 people down here in key west and we all have our little red stilettos to go with sushi's red stiletto. Midnight sushi coming down in the lime green dress. Anderson, kathy? 

[01:31:45]


>> John, thanks very much. 
>> Could you get a straighter guy? 
>> That's what I like about it. John goes -- 
>> minnow out of water. 
>> I like it. 
>> But you don't even let sushi talk anymore. 
>> We've done interviews with sushi in the past. 
>> Yeah, before we came out. Sushi was like, hey, girl, and it was awkward. 
>> I didn't think it was awkward. 
>> Sushi would be like hey, girl, what's up, girl and i would get nervous and it was an mc hammer moment. Where are we going to go after this tonight? Every year we've gone to -- 
>> I'll tell you how this EVENING USUALLYndS. We got a viewer question. This is one of the questions. From joanie, do you and kathy go after midnight for hot chocolate or champagne? Kathy doesn't drink. We usually have ended up in her hotel room. 
>> Which is fun because I'm a riot and we have free cookies. 
>> It's true, there's cookies. 
>> And whatever guy I'm banging. 
>> Whoever you're banging. And I go home. And you end up in a donut store somewhere at like 3 a.M., Right 
>> that's true. 
>> What really happens is year after year, I assume he wants to hang out with me because I'm a superstar and a riot. He always has a ridiculous excuse, oh, I'm going to hang out with my nieces and nephews and then iet an e-mail that you were with andy cohen's super party. 
>> Andy cohen didn't have a -- 
>> one year he did. 
>> What are you doing this year? 
>> Ah -- 
>> I would like to go for a tuna melt. 
>> Do you or kathy make new year's resolutions? 
>> I do make resolutions. 
>> What's your resolutions? 
>> Shoot, I have some really funny ones. To sing with you "you don't bring me flowers" on the air. 

[01:33:49]


>> Every year you ask me my resolutions and as soon as i start to tell you them, you fall asleep because they're so boring. They're always the same. I want to get in better shape. 
>> I miss psy so much. I had a connection with him. He has money shooting out his butt. 
>> Savannah wants to know would you ever switch roles, kathy being the serious one? 
>> You got it right. The real story is he is on a britney spears hold up here all the time. He might as well be on the gurney with the fireman because I am the sane one. I'm keeping the whole thing in order. I e-mailed -- 
>> you throw out a 51-50. 
>> If anyone is going to know what a 51-50 is tonight, call any local hospital and ask for anderson cooper and he's going to be there for three days. What about when I sent an e-mail to the network and said can we rehearse more, can we get more pr and the response was we're counterprogramming. 
>> Monica says I'd like to see you wear the same outfits like you were brother and sister twins. 
>> I'm in. What do you want to wear? Do you want to take our clothes off now? If we were takd neighborhood, we'd be like twin. 
>> Another says can anderson get a word in every once in a while. 
>> You hit me! You're like ike turner! You know that movie "what's love got to do with it"? 
>> I just listened to tina turner. 
>> She's so amazing. When she crosses the freeway. She's performing live, tina turner in seven minutes with rihanna and general david petraeus. And the president is about to speak. 
>> And vice president biden we thought was going to speak earlier but he's not going to speak. 
>> Ladies and gentlemen, I bring you andon cooper and kathy griffin singing the classic neil diamond and barbra streisand singing "you don't bring me flowers." You don't bring me flowers, you don't talk to me anymore at the end of the day 

[01:36:10]


>> let's go to gary tuchman. He's in the sardine capital of the world. 
>> Really? Can you verify it's the sardine capital of the world? 
>> I can possibly. 
>> I'm trying to reach out. Look at gary. 
>> Gary, how are you holding up? 
>> Reporter: Anderson, kathy, I'm holding up great. How many of our viewers have heard of a sardine drop before this very night? That's what's happening. This is eastport, maine, tiny town, 1,300 people. They're so quiet right now. How come? They should not be quiet. This is a very unique place. We can see the sardine. This used to be the sardine capital of the united states, that sardine, eight feet long made by a nice man who is an artist will be lowered. You have the ball in times square but we in eastport, connecticut -- I mean eastport, maine -- this is the eastern most city in the united states. One mile to that side is new brins wick, canada. It's a time machine. You walk a mile in that direction, it's 2013. One mile this way, it's 2012. Just about 35 minutes ago, 36 minutes ago a maple leaf was lowered to honor the new year in canada. At 12:00 midnight that sardine will come down and it will be new year here in maine and the rest of the eastern time zone. Right, everybody? 
[ Cheers and applause ] >> 
Reporter: It is not times square but there are hundreds of people in this tiny town with a very hardy celebration. Anderson, kathy, back to you. 
>> Thank you, gary. 
>> Break it down. 
>> This is a cool broadcast because gary is keeping it real with, you know, a minnow and a bucket. You and I are just talking and behind us is taylor swift. And up just said to me in the commercial break don't say anything bad about her. I'm not saying she has an eating disorder. I'm saying she's slender. 

[01:38:29]


>> She seems like a lovely young woman. 
>> Can she stop whining about her perfect life in all those songs? 
>> Does she whine about her perfect life? 
>> Yes, she went out with john and she was like I will never, never, never take your call again, jake hall. 
>> He seems like a nice guy. 
>> Exactly. Are we supposed to act like she's not behind us? This is why you should watch us and not taylor swift because we are now going to sing the dolly parton/kenny rodgers classic "islands in the stream." Ready? Islands in the stream that, is what we are no one in between, how can we be wrong? 
>> Caller: Sail away with me to another world where we we rely on each other >> that's not working for me. Let's move on. Let's move on. Do you think people would watch taylor swift over us? 
>> She's not doing anything. She's just standing there. 
>> Thank you. He said it. 
>> What are we about 30 minutes away from the ball drop? A check on the time here. We are 22 minutes away from the new year. As you look to the new year, what are you most excited about? 
>> I'm most excited about having a positive new year and good things happening to people because I think it's kind of a rough year, let's cut the crap. A lot of my tweets were like i want to have a better year. There's a real moment for you, coop. 
>> That's ce. I appreciate that. 
>> I'm glad we didn't have a drinking game of real moments because nobody would be drunk. 
>> No doubt a lot of drinking games. There han a lot of them, if I giggle nervously, people drink. 
>> I think I know how to get threw because taylor swift is on the big screen behind us, you warned me not to make fun of her and I'm calling her a skinny whiner who needs to zip it. 
>> I saw her on "60 minutes" and she seemed like a lovely person. 
>> Did you interview her? 
>> No, I didn't. Leslie stahl did. 

[01:40:29]


>> Do you have a rivalry with leslie stahl?

>> I love it. 
>> It feels like a poke in the eye. Or a blank in the eye. So many memorable moments. We did an online poll asking viewers to name their favorite moments over the years. This one tops the list. 
>> Are you kidding me? 
>> We just saw lady gaga and i thought -- 
>> are you kidding me? I swear, I'm literally talking to you guys and I turn around --

>> Bam. That's how you roll. 
>> In your face, psy. Take that, jepson.

>> No. I got it. 
>> No, no. Let me take care of this.

With this crowd, it's like 50,000 friends. Over my shoulder it's jackson square. Right behind this local band, some serious horns. This is valderrama. We were checking them out. As we count down here in new orleans central time. The crazy fireworks will be in the night sky above the mighty mississippi.

It is amazing as we ring in 2013 with the music note behind me. That's going to come down 150 feet. We're talking about confetti. Also fireworks. It is a huge party here, brooke.

This is my very first new year's. And it kind of rocks. I've never, ever seen crowds like this. You're looking at pictures. This is the fleur-de-lis, of course. If you've been to new orleans, you know the fleur-de-lis is really the symbol here of new orleans. That's sitting atop jack's brewery here in the french quarter. We also have -- this is sofrt quintessential new orleans. You have the baby new year. A little back story with the baby new year is the fact they had this baby, they spray-paint this baby. It represents basically out with the old, in with the new year, the rebirth of the new year. The kingpin. Mardi gras here. Apparently, what happened with this baby new year with katrina a number of years ago, baby new year floated away, and angly enough they found baby new year floating along this warehouse with these guys who apparently put all these floats together. Baby new year now has this new orleans saints helmet on. Honestly, who dat nation here is very proud of the saints. That's just a little bit of the back story here in new orleans. I've got a couple jazz local musicians. We're going to talk to them here in just a moment. If we have sanjay, because i think sanjay gupta is still running in central park. Sanjay gupta is running?

I want into the deuce you to two people who really around these parts are very much so known in music circles. You've heard of the marsalis family. This is jason marsalis. Welcome. Percussionist. Drums. Also, dr. Michael white is joining me. A classic clarinetist. So we're going to hear them. They've actually put a little something together special for cnn on new year's. Forgive me. I'm now shouting. Because we're fighting with the party right now in new orleans. Tell me, though, you're born and raised here. What do you make of these thousands of people in your town? 
>> New orleans is a party town, man. This always happens all the time. I mean, if a dog had a birthday, they'd throw a party for that. That's just how it is here. 
>> That's one way to describu it. Dr. White, let me just ask you. You've been here for years and years. You're known around here. When you're in new orleans, you can't help but sort of like bop your head or tap your toes. What is this city like? This city wouldn't exist without music. 
>> Oh, music is new orleans. New orleans is music. And this is the greatest place in the world to celebrate new year's. There's music here all the time, and it grows up like grass here and it's part of the culture, part of the heritage. So you have to get into it. And dancing of course goes along with it. 
>> We've been dancing all night long on and off television. I'll tell you that much. This is so special, you guys. Do your thing. ???????????? [ Playing "auld lang syne" ] ???????????? ???????????? ???????????? 

[02:52:10]


>> you sound great. It's a dance party. Dance party. New orleans style. Yes! We've got like a whole cheering section over here. That was fantastic, you all. Thank you so much. Let me just ask you this. We're minutes away from the new year. Are you new year's resolution believers, and if so do you have one? 
>> New year's resolution? Just to learn more music. 
>> To learn more music. Well spoken. 
>> We have the exact same new year's resolution. But I'm going to bring in the new year the right way. I'm going to give you a gift from new orleans. My latest cd, "adventures in new orleans jazz part 2." 
>> Dr. White, thank you so much. You can get their albums. Basin street records. Your new one is coming out in february. I got you. You got it. This is a little flavor of what we see, what we're feeling here in the big easy. I want to go now, take you a little farther north, where it's a little chillier, maybe not quite as rocking, to central park, to sanjay gupta, a man who I know has run a triathlon. Sanjay, how's the running going? 
>> I just got my first run of 2013 out of the way, brooke. It was fantastic. Called the emerald nuts run here in central park. It's about, what, about four miles? Four miles or so? It was a lot of fun. It was cold. But you warmed up nicely. It's a great way to start the new year. And I have jason and aileen . 
>> Happy new year! 
>> And a reveler. So you guys, this is the first time you guys did this race? 
>> Yeah. 
>> First time this one. 
>> Why did you decide to do it? 
>> Why? Well, we wskiing this weekend and we wanted to come back for brooklyn, we started looking for things to do and found this on -- I don't know what website. But we were like oh, it seems like fun, fireworks, music, the whole thing. 
>> The fireworks were amazing. Most people are out having fun tonight, jason, drinking, having a good time. Yet you're running. 

[02:54:13]


>> We had fun. We had more fun than any of them. And not much drinking. 
>> We met this awesome couple from london like two hours before we came, they were buying us bourbon. They were like you're running in a bathing suit. I'm like I need to warm up. 
>> So you drank a lot of bourbon before the race? 
>> We had a couple of rounds of bourbon with a lovely couple. 
>> Are you cold now? 
>> No. I feel great. 
>> What do you want to say to people out there who are watching who are thinking you're basically crazy for having done this right now? 
>> Happy new year. Best wishsz for a happy, lovely, successful, prosperous 2013. We love you. 
>> We're not going to be as hung over as you tomorrow. 
>> Thanks a lot for joining us. Brooke, I'll tell you, this is a race that's been around since 1979. People literally running around the park. They had this remarkable fireworks display at the beginning. Sort of a mock champagne toast halfway through. And I'll tell you, the best part about this, brooke, is you got to get -- you got this run out of the way. Your first run out of the way of 2013. Brooke, I'm having a hard time hearing. I know you're having a hard time hearing. But I think I heard somebody saying something about going to maine next, gary tuchman. Is that gary tuchman up there in maine? 
>> Sanjay, we're here at the afterparty in eastport, maine. This is the wacko diner. Yes, it's called wacko. It's spelled like waco but it's pronounced "wacko." The oldest diner in the state of main. 88 years old. And this is a very proud city. Only 1,300 people live here. It's one mile away from the canadian border, the province of new brunswick. New brunswick started new year 2013 an hour earlier. They're in the atlantic time zone. Want to show you a three-story building, the tallest building in town. They don't lower a crystal ball here. They lower a cannedman maple leaf. For the beginning of the new year in the atlantic time zone, which is eastern canada, parts of the caribbean, and parts of south america. When that maple leaf comes down, it is 2013. But it was still 2012 here for an hour. An hour later they lower, yes, a sardine because this used to be the sardine capital of the united states of america. The sardine came down that three-story art museum tower, and then it was 2013 here in maine. Now, let me tell -- right now on that monitor, that's the behind the scenes -- there's a little delay there. People are watching on the monitor. But I will tell you there's a tradition here when the sardine gets lowered to kiss the sardine. So I wanted to know, how many of you kissed the sardine? 

[02:56:39]


[ Cheers ] how many of you are going to get medical care after kissing that sardine so many times? 
[ Cheers ] yeah! What's amazing, this is not a bar. This is a diner. No one's drinking and they're having this muchun anyway. And that tells you a lot about new year's here in the city of eastport, maine, the easternmost city in the united states. Brooke, back to you. 
>> Oh, well, I can tell you there's more than a few people, gary tuchman, here in the big easy are having a little bit of fun and a little bit to drink. You can tell that it's sort of the excitement is palpable. You can tell that the countdown here in new orleans is really about to begin. Central time. They're get psyched on the stage. And just take a look at the cr we have another camera here. You can really see the sheer volume. Here we go. Both sides of the screen. Fleur-de-lis here in new orleans on the left-hand side. You have the music note there in nashville. So for those of you hanging out at home sipping the champagne, stay with us. We are in the heart of the french quarter. I was saying earlier, this is my very first new year's here in new orleans, and it's something really to behold. If you can fight the crowds, enjoy the crowds, enjoy the music, you really feel it just deep down in your soul in a city like this. It is a blast any day of the year. But you have new year's eve. You have the sugar bowl in a couple of days. And it's pretty spectacular. I want you to listen in just for a moment here to these guys on the stage, and then we'll count down. 
>> Wow. Who thinks 2013's going to be the best year yet? Who do you think's going to win the super bowl? 
>> I don't know if you can hear the people behind me. And I'm looking and I'm cheating. I'm looking and I'm cheating and I'm looking at my phone. So we're just about two minutes away. Okay. Susan hendricks. Susan hendricks. Let's go to susan quickly in nashville. Susan, it's almost that time. 

[02:58:44]


>> Hey, brooke, yes, it is. We are in nashville, music city. The fray just got off the stage. Really amazing. I've never seen thousands of people sn the rain all together. And we are about to bring in the new year, 2013, one minutes 20 seconds to go. What a way to bring it in, outside of the hard rock. An amazing crowd. A little chilly and rainy. No one seems to care. The fray was absolutely amazing. And again, you see that big red note up there? That's going to drop. 115 feet down. And we are going to ring in 2013, brooke. Here we go. 52 seconds to go. And we are bringing in 2013. No one cares that it's raining. Here we go. 
>> We're looking at both the screens. New orleans on the left-hand side. Nashville here on the right. 30 seconds to go. 30 seconds to go. You've got the fleur-de-lis, you've got the fleur-de-lis,

=======================================================

As a nation, we make millions of products every year. But have you ever wondered just how those things are made and what drives those companies? Tonight in this "n.B.R." Special edition "made in america" we go to towns small and large to meet unique businesses building jobs and profits. That and more tonight on "n.B.R." Good evening, I'm mike hegedus with an n.B.R. Special edition, made in america. Walking down kentucky street in downtown petaluma, california, but it could be anywhere, u.S.A. This is where small businesses live. Small businesses that create two out of every three new jobs in the u.S. Tonight you're going to meet some of the people behind those businesses and find out how they plan to keep building those businesses. We begin with the housing market, ground zero for the recession. From construction to appliance makers, when it collapsed it took a lot of very good companies down with it. But here's one that has managed to learn how to paint over the rough spots. You can brush it on, you can roll it on, you can get it on your pants. Paint. The kelly moore plant in san carlos, california, turns out nearly 40,000 gallons a day. It's one of the largest employee-owned paint operations in the u.S. Part of a $13 billion industry domestically. 140 workers in the 15 acre san carlos facility, 1,500 world wide, including 150 retail outlets in seven states. 
>> We own currently 58% of the stock and the rest of the stock is owned by the moore family. 
>> Mike: You like white? They got it. You like -- they got that, too. 
>> Still seeing a lot of reds. That teal is slipping into it. Teal and turquoise. Green still kind of there still. Yellows, yellow influence, neutrals are still there. But the teals and the reds and oranges. Oranges are just really popular right now, too. 
>> I started off with. 
>> Mike: Steve devoe is chairman and c.E.O. Of the 66-year-old company. He does not paint a pretty picture of what they and every other paint manufacturer has been through over the last couple years. What he does do is point out why kelly moore fared better than most. First, history. They have it. Started in 1946 by bill kelly and william e. Moore, the goal 

[00:02:16]


was simple: Make a quality paint that professionals would be proud to use. And second, understand that those professionals are not only your customers but your partners. What a concept! Quality and loyalty trump chasing the market down. 
>> What we stay focused on was number one what we're known for, which is quality. We know who our customers are and we never took our eyes off that. We became a real strong partner with them over the couple years that the downturn hurt us all. 
>> Reporter: Kelly moore even set up classes, tutorials for small business owners, customers, to teach them how to survive tough times and it looked for bigger markets. A western regional player in the u.S., Kelly moore now ships paint to china, japan, cambodia, vietnam. The driver? 
>> Quality product for one and the second factor is that it's made if the u.S. That's what they seek. That's what they want. It's that quality. 
>> Mike: What kelly moore seeks is the next great break through in paint. Odorless, longer lasting, environmentally friendly. Strides have been made in almost every area-- except one. 
>> It can't apply itself. That's something people always want it to do. 
>> Mike: (Laughs) 
>> it's-- a lot of it lately is about ease of application and saving time and time is money. 
>> Mike: The color of money. Always a good choice. 
>> Mike: Farming is a very difficult business and while technology and large corporate farms have made american agriculture some of the most productive in the world, small family farms are having a very difficult time surviving. Unless they become very creative. How much passion, persistence, and profitability can you squeeze into a 15-pound block of cheese? At the petaluma creamery in petaluma, california, not quite enough of the last. Why did you buy it? 

[00:04:19]


>> I wanted to saving a which you are in sonoma county. 
>> Mike: That's a tall order. Anybody ever told you you were nuts? 
>> Oh, yes. Many a times. 
>> Mike: Larry peter bought the 99-year-old petaluma creamery in 2004. It was idle, about to be torn down. A dairyman, peter owns 300 head of jersey milking cows, they roam free on his ranch in two ROCK, ORGANIC TO Nth DEGREE. A first-generation farmer, peter cobbled together a living from the land, milk, a pumpkin patch in the fall, farmer's markets. But after nearly two decades, he needed to do something to increase revenue. 
>> I figured if I could cut out the middleman, grow the feed, milk the cow, make thcheese and sell the product to the customer I would be able to help pay my mortgage better. 
>> Mike: So he bought the creamery, bringing in milk for more than 30 dairies in northern california, saving them the transportation cost to creameries three and four hours away and giving him the milk necessary to make 300,000 pounds of high-quality specialty cheese a week. 22 varieties under his spring hill jersey cheese brand name. 
>> It was lk and it turns into curds and whey. 
>> Mike: Larry peter is a small curd in a $27 billion plus market. Until -- 
>> chipotle seen that I was like an american dream. 
>> Mike: He was discovered by the chipotle mexican grill restaurant chain. Its marketing slogan is "food with integrity." Larry peter has both and his cheese is in their restaurants. 
>> They're looking for people with passion. They want to go back and they want to buy a product the way it was 45, 50 years ago where cows are just on grass, they weren't pushed. 
>> Mike: It's the slow food, sustainable farming, buy local organic quality food movement that has pushed artesian cheese into cheese sold. And larry peter has found the sweet spot. 
>> Now the artists of the world, the chefs, are taking these cheeses and developing them in their recipes and it's a real plus. 

[00:06:21]


>> People look for acid in cheese. People look for the bite of the cheese. People try to take cheese and judge it like they judge wine. For an example, the dryer the cheese, the dryer the wine. 
>> Mike: The petaluma creamery, its cows roam free and its owner has a vision. 
>> If you love what you do and you believe in yourself and put passion in anything you can do, you can make anything happen. 
>> Mike: When you talk about creating jobs, the role of immigration can be a real hot button issue and nowhere do the two come in more direct contact with each other than in the central valley of california. Now, you're about to see how taylor farms is using technology to help bridge that gap. It is the sound of technology making up for policy. It is where a machine fills the void left by a declining work force. A romaine field outside salinas, california, high pressure water jets cutting heads of lettuce, an efficient eliminator of stoop labor, better for the workers that remain and better for the company that has seen its labor pool drained by foggy immigration rules. 
>> The purpose of the machine is to reduce our dependency on foreign labor. And numbers in the field in general. All of our fields prior to harvest are microtested where they're coming in and there's random samples taken throughout the field. And before we can bring our equipment in and harvest, those samples have been sent to a lab and the field has been deemed clear. 
>> Mike: This one of two automated harvesters built and designed by taylor farms, a $1.6 billion a year player in the produce business. Contracting with hundreds of farmers throughout california and arizona. Taylor farms, a 17-year-old company, has a 65% share of the food service market, providing lettuce to some very well-known names. 

[00:08:23]


>> SUBWAY, McDONALD'S, BURGER King, taco bell and if you go to a local restaurant it would be red lobsters, olive gardens, outback steak house. This is our loading dock. We have 23 dock doors, we start loing trucks around 7:00 in the morning and load all night. 
>> Mike:13.5 million pounds of finished product, from romaine to iceberg and carrots and cabbage flow through the plant inalinas. Taylor farms has a 20% share of the retail produce sector. 
>> We're all about getting it in and out as quick as possible because it is perishable. So we will turn this entire warehouse in one day. 
>> Mike: So everything I see here is gone in one day and the place is filled again? 
>> Filled again, yup. 
>> Mike: While staggering to think about, nothing compares to 
this: The entire plant, everything except the walls, is moved to yuma, arizona, in november and then back to salinas in the spring. The whole plant follows the growing season. 
>> If it's moving, it's going to yuma. 
>> Mike: Watch! The 1,000 or so plant workers migrate as well with about a 95% retention rate. The same not true for field workers. Thus the automated harvesters, making sure the lettuce is picked when and how it needs to be. 
>> We're looking for a nice upright tight hearted starting to close in head. 
>> Mike: They are the lifeblood 
of the u.S. Economy: Small and medium-size businesses. And the fastest-growing segment are those small businesses owned and operated by women. Let's meet some women now who are tipping their hat, both to history and to future growth. It has been going on at paul's hat works in san francisco's richmond district since 1918, the making of hats. Lineage that runs from its peruvian founder over 94 years to four young women from the neighborhood. 

[00:10:40]


>> We were kind of an odd bunch before, didn't plan to be hatters, as most people probably don't, and stumbled on it, really did. Stumbled on it. And the story and the ambience and that's what took us. 
>> Mike: The stois a familiar 
one: In 2009, battered by the down economy, the owner needed to sell, no one would buy. So the option was to shut it down, walk away, hat in hand. Except in walked a preschool preschool teacher, two costumers and a bookkeeper, saviors in bright colors, with passion. 
>> We did it because, a, this place was going to evaporate if we didn't. Nobody else was going to do it. The four of us are makers of things. We love the craft and we love old crafts and this was something that you can only learn how to be a hatter by apprenticing. So this is a skill that they're not teaching in school. See, this is kind of a taller crown. 
>> Mike: What they will teach in school is how to run a business. Classes they found and took to learn about price points, niche markets, branding, sourcing, business plans. 
>> Business is a different language, you know? So I had to learn the language. 
>> Mike: The language they're speaking now is of success and expansion. One of only a handful of hat makers anywhere working in the hand made custom fit on average $650 per hat market, they get their straw blends from ecuador, the resurgence in men's hats were which were practical and ICONIC IN THE 1930s, '40s, AND '50s,S HATS ARE ON THE HEADS OF Presidents and a younger generation. So paul's hat works is headed to the big apple. 
>> More people; more money; more style in new york. 
>> Mike: The language of the custom hat business. 

[00:12:51]


>> Mike: Most silicon valley startups have one common goal: To be the next breakout company. Next, three brothers who are on that pa millions already know their product and their growth is NOTHING TO C/tOM AT. 
>> So this is the pitch. 
>> Mike: Meet the brothers smith, nate, ben, and tom. And if the smith brothers has a certain ring to it, well, it's because they are related to those other ones of ahem cough drop and elixir fame. But what these smith brothers are known for are video games. Cordy, cordy sky and sleepy jack, three of the most popular game apps in the digital universe. Millions, multimillions of downloads across all platforms. 
>> Mobile phones, tablets, p.C., television, set top boxes and trying to have kind of fluid experiences across all those different types of streams. 
>> Mike: The ability to go from here to there -- 
>> yup. 
>> Mike: To there -- 
>> to the t.V. 
>> Mike: Is a huge deal. 
>> S. Yeah. And that's the thing I think we're ahead of the curve there in terms of our designs working that way. 
>> Mike: They are the principals in eight-year-old silvertree media. A couple dozen folks in a downtown historic palo alto, california, building. They are virtual world creators and storytellers. When you consider there are hundreds of millions of devices upon which their games will play, there is nothing sleepy about that, jack. 
>> We always try to think of ourselves as the pixar of the mobile industry. So we try to make things that kids will like it but their parents will like it as well. If we go at these characters with-- that there is a life and a heart to each of the characters that we're working on that we show to the world that people will pick up on that over time. 
>> Mike: This is how they got their start, creating a fairy world for disney, which led to "tron" and work for electronic arts and microsoft. In 2009 they decided to launch their own stuff but how did they get there? Where does one start on this journey into virtual fame and fortune? Try pittsburgh. 

[00:14:58]


>> Half of them are computer scientists or engineers and the other half are artists. 
>> Mike: Both ben and tom are graduates of carnegie mellon's unique entertainment technology center master's program, a combination of computer sciences, engineering and art that has given birth to perhaps more game makers and changers than any other place in the real world and was the home of -- 
>> find the best in everybody. 
>> Mike: Professor randy palm whose last lecture became a phenomenon. It was a viral inspiration to millions but he was an inspiration to the smiths long before that. 
>> From the beginning of us starting this company he said "you guys really have something here. You have something unique. And keep developing that. Keep making a-- make the best company you can possibly make and shoot for the stars." 
>> Mike: Shooting for the stars. They can do that. 
>> It will take you a long time to design a square head on this guy. 
>> Yeah. 
>> Mike: It's no secret that the new media-- both the internet and digital devices-- has taken a large bite out of the newspaper and magazine businesses. But there are some notable exceptions. We'll take you now to one company that is determined not to let the sun set on old media. It is doing more than just scratching for chicken feed in the media barnyard. It is planting the seeds of new business and adding to the stew of profitability. It is sunset magazine. 
>> Print's not going to go away. That our readers love having that thing they hold in their hands. And the important thing is for us to understand why they are taking a print publication. I probably need to talk to kathy right away. 
>> Mike: They have been putting together sunset magazine since 18, started as a means of drawing tourists west by the southern pacific railroad. It's the largest life-style publication this side of the rockies. 

[00:17:07]


>> We have 1.25 million subscribers and our total audience is about 4.7 million. 
>> Mike: Based in menlo park, its seven-acre campus is home to a test kitchen. Every recipe vetted here. 
>> Sunset has the best testing system I've ever seen. 
>> Mike: And working gardens. It if grows in the west-- or doesn't-- they know about it first. You're carrying the bible. 
>> I am carrying the bible. 
>> Mike: This is -- 
>> and it's heavy! 
>> Mike: This is the bible. Sunset's garden book having sold over six million copies, the latest version the best selling book of its kind this year. Both food and gardening are bedrock under the sun se$ foundation but magazine bedrock has been crumbling so how has the sunset brand-- a division of time warner-- managed to say strong, relevant, desirable? By throwing a party. This one of several events that sunset puts on yearly. It's called "bringing the brand to life." 20,000 people over two days. And nobody likes it more than one very important group. 
>> We have celebrity chefs and we have gardening experts and we have home experts and our editors are talking, there's a lot of sampling. It's a really fun event and that actually is of great interest to our advertisers right now to be able to bring the brand to life and to be able to introduce consumers directly to the brand. 
>> Audiences today expect that it's a dialogue, not a one-way street. And that's actually challenge for print. You can not simply be the authority. 
>> Mike: Along with events, sunset engages in a multipronged business strategy. A million unique viewers on its web page. An ipad application, licensing, custom publishing, sunset does book for pillsbury and weber grills and is now branding and selling its own line of plants. 
>> Sunset editors selected these from a lot of new offerings working with the plant development company. 
>> Mike: Sunset magazine: Sewing the seeds of new business in the shifting soil of modern media. Do you suppose that's chicken stew? 

[00:19:22]


>> Mike: The restaurant business is one of the toughest the world. More close than open every year and of those that stay open, very short expected life span. Just about two years. So how do you explain one northern california family owned and operated restaurant business that keeps expanding? In this case, the secret really is in the sauce. It is that all-american recipe 
for success: Hard work, quality product, loyal customers and one special secret ingredient. 
>> It's the sauce. It really is. 
>> My grandmother told me never, ever, ever give the recipe out or you're kicked out the family. 
>> Mike: (Laughs) if the sauce is the key, what it has opened the is the door to success for everett and jones, arguably the best known barbecue restaurant chain in northern california. Five outlets with this, the jack london square location in oakland, the largest. 
>> Those are homemade sausages. 
>> Mike: It's owned and operated by dorothy king jurnigan and her children, four daughters and two sons. Business acumen passed generation to generation. 
>> Consistency. That's the key to having a successful business. 
>> Knowing the history and where my grandmother went through to hit this business it just made me work harder and just love it. I love it. 
>> Mike: It's a history that stretches back to a shoeless family in rural alabama, one that moved to oakland in the '50s AND ONE THAT SAW DOROTHY Everett, a single mother of eight, open her first restaurant-- with that sauce-- in 1973. It provided a good living and created a desire for something more. 
>> My mom said to me "dorothy, they are not going to give a black woman that much money. 
>> Mike: But they did and after a stint at the haas business school at u.C. Berkeley, she opened this location, one that includes a music venue and has played host to a string of sports and entertainment celebrities. Contactconnections that are leading everett and jones to a southern california expansion. 

[00:21:33]


>> I'm also expanding, too. I have a store coming up in los angeles. So future's great. 
>> Mike: Along with bricks and mortar and researching opportunities for their ribs in retail, the everett and jones name is spreading across the u.S., The sauce available in 300 stores. And thanks to the internet, internationally orders coming in from fresno to france, from roanoke to russia. It seems once they taste it, well-- 
>> my mom alwaysaid word of mouth is the best advertisement. 
>> Particularly when the words taste so od. 
>> Mike: There is no business that is recession proof but there is one that comes close: Pets, and all the stuff people buy for them. Americans spent over $50 billion on their pets in 2011, the largest chunk of that on food. There are more of them than kids and we spend more on them than on our husbands and wives. Pets. And if the slow-food movement is all the rage for humans than sparky, bucky, cuddl, and toots aren't far behind. 
>> It is totally inspired with what we were doing with our own food. Things that we were buying inspired we should be applying these same ideas to the pet food, the fact that we only eat local and our pet food should be local as well. We thought pet owners would like that idea. 
>> Mike: They did, in large numbers. So large, five-year-old san francisco-based small batch pets is one of the fastest growing companies in the raw slice of the $20 billion pet food industry. 
>> Dogs and cats don't cook. That's the best way I can put it. They're anatomically made to eat raw food. It's completely bio available to them, they assimilate it properly, you'd see it in their coat, their teeth. 

[00:23:35]


>> Mike: Nice doggie. 
>> This is where all the magic began. 
>> Mike: Small batch pets started in the mission district, one bowl, one blender, giving the food away to folks in the neighborhood. That was then. This is honestly small batch. 
>> We get in a truckload on a wednesday morning and we're shipping almost half of it out that same day. 
>> Mike: This is now. Distribution border to border in california with expansion on track for the entire pacific northwest. That said, how do you keep the small in small batch? 
>> We're going to grow. That's going to happen. With a great product get it out there but we're still producing it in relative small batches to the rest of the industry. 
>> As long as we are stringent in our belief and we adapt the same business model in other regions, source locally, for example, we're going to go to the pacific northwest, set up manufacturing in portland, we're going to produce there and procure ingredients there is. We're only going to ship to that region. 
>> Mike: Buy local; make local; eat mantra. A slow food mantra for the animal kingdom. 
>> Quality ingredients made locally. What more do you need? 
>> Mike: Ask him. I've often asked why I spend so much of my time crisscrossing america reporting on and talking to small business owners. Well, the answer is really 
pretty simple: Look, the u.S. Economy has become centered on high finance, meaning major banks, corporations and wall street. That's fine. Except that it's the blood, sweat and tears of small business people that have made this country what it is today. It's a that same blood, sweat and tears that will get us where we want to go.

=======================================================

Tonight, new year, same congress. Tonight, still no deal. Over the cliff and apparently staying there. After the vice president steps in, both sides got closer, but tonight, the giant setback. And already, your taxes have gone up. 
>>> Hillary's fight. The secretary of state under the close watch of her doctors tonight, with a blood clot near her brain. This evening, the first message from chelsea clinton, seen visiting the hospital. 
>>> Comeback story. Our friend and colleague at espn, hannah stor back posting the rose parade a a terrifying accident at home. The grill explosion that left her with first and second degree burns. Tonight, the lesson for all of us as she shares her story, right here. 
>>> And the reunion. The moment at the parade no one saw coming. Not even the little boy, stunned by his new year's surprise. 
>>> Good evening. Diane is back here tomorrow night. And we begin tonight on this first evening of the new year, when so many americans make resolutions to change, but it appears not much has changed in washington. When that famous ball dropped at midnight, taxes went up for every american. This evening, after the vice president jumped in, a giant setback. So, let's get right to abc's chief white house correspondent jon karl tonight. It would seem like they're playing with fire now. Taxes, at least, for this evening, have gone up and the stock market already seeing jitters leading up to the cliff. 
>> Reporter: They are certainly worried about the market reaction. Washington went over the fiscal cliff last night, triggering tax increases for virtually everybody. And despite some hopeful signs very early this morning, we are still in afall. It sure looked like a done deal. 
>> The yeahs are 89. The nays are 8. The bill as amended is passed. 

[00:02:00]


>> Reporter: After 2:00 a.M. This morning, the senate approved a bill to prevent massive tax increases from going into affect today. The kind of overwhelming bipartisan vote almost never seen anymore. 
>> So, it took an imperfect solution to prevent our constituents from a very real financial pain. But in my view, it was worth the effort. 
>> Reporter: Finally, it seemed, washington was working. Vice president joe biden and republican leader mitch McCONNELL HASHING OUT THE DEAL Late last night. 
>> Really very good about how this vote is going to go. 
>> Reporter: He had reason to smile last night, but today, that late night deal hit a wall of republican opposition in the house. Hastily leaving a meeting of house republicans today, eric cantor, the second highest ranking republican in the house, announced even he was opposed. 
>> I do not support the bill. 
>> Reporter: House republicans objected because the bill including virtually no spending cuts. In fact, the deal would actually add nearly $4 trillion to the deficit over the next ten years. Mostly thanks to the cost of extending those tax cuts for everybody making under $400,000. 
>> There's no spending cuts. We're adding $4 billion a day to the debt. And we feel like the senate bill failed miserably. 
>> Reporter: If they don't get their act together, the consequences will be immediate. The pentagon has already drafted notices to 800,000 civilian employees warning they may be put on unpaid leave. And those tax increases triggered today will start to hit our paychecks this we the average family, seeing a tax increase of almost $3,500. There is intense pressure on house republican leaders to resolve this before the stock market opens tomorrow morning. They are hearing from business leaders. They are also hearing from senate republicans, saying that the cost of failure on this, david, would just be too high. 
>> Would love to be on some of those phone calls, jon. Thank you. As you point out, wall street does open tomorrow morning. After a week straight of losses already, nervous investors le leading up to the fiscal cliff, the average 401 k losing $3,000 in this country. Abc's bianna golodryga was the story of just one family and the huge tax increase, if congress doesn't figure this out. 

[00:04:17]


>> Reporter: Until there's an agreement, this what the martins from raytown, missouri, like so many middle class american families, face. A hefty spike in taxes. Beau, a government contractor, and deanna, an office worker, make a combined income of about $60,000. Without a deal, their income taxes will rise by roughly $2,400 a year. On top of that, like everyone else earning $110,000 or less, they'll pay higher payroll taxes to pay for social security. With or without a deal, those are set to go up across the board by 2%. And for the martins, that means they'll pay an additional $1,200 a year. Income and payroll tax increases combined, the martins are looking at an additional $3,600 in 2013. And it doesn't stop there. Without a deal, feeding their 2-month-old baby daughter, grace, could cost the martins a lot more, too. Every american faces the potential for a huge jump in milk prices. The farm bill has stalled, and subsidies have been rolled back. Without a deal securing that help for farmers, the price of a gallon of milk could shoot up to almost $7 a llon. Families paying the price at the grocery store. 
>> Very alarming numbers here. Bianna is here. What do you suppose is going to happen tomorrow? What are your people telling you? 
>> Reporter: Everyone is curious to see what happens overnight. One of two things could happen. If congress does attach spending cuts, that bill is blown up and you can see markets really sell off tomorrow. If this is just punted along, markets could beittle bit more patient but patience is running out. AND 401(k)s ARE BEING AFFECTED, As well. 
>> Bianna, thank you. 
>>> We're going to turn now to secretary of state hillary clinton. Doctors keeping a careful eye on mrs. Clinton. We reported on their discovery, the blood clot right next to her brain. Tonight, we know former president bill clinton and their daughter chelsea have been bill her side and the first message from chelsea on twitter. Here's abc's sharyn alfonsi now. 

[00:06:20]


>> Reporter: Chelsea clinton leaving the hospital, where her mother will spend a third night. Later optimistically tweeting, "thank you all for sending good thoughts my mom's way. Grateful to all her doctors and that she'll make a full recovery!" But it's clearly a serious setback for the secretary. It's been three weeks since she was last seen in public, overseas where she picked up a bad stomach virus. Days later, at her home, she fainted and got a concussion, grounding the normally globe-trotting secretary. Clinton has traveled to 112 countries, logged nearly a million miles and spent the equivalent of an entire year of her life on a plane. Recently telling barbara walters she was eager to step down as secretary of state. 
>> Why are you leaving? 
>> I've been, as you know, at the highest levels of american and now international activities for 20 years. And I -- I just thought it was time to take a step off. I wanted to take some time and -- and just really collect myself. 
>> Are you exhausted? 
>> I am. 
>> Reporter: Clinton told "the new york times" she was looking forward to sleeping, exercise, and relaxing watching hgtv. Still, those who've watched her for decades from first lady, to candidate, to the most traveled secretary of state ever, wonder if that's in her dna. Is a quiet retirement really in the future of hillary clinton? 
>> It seems out of character, certainly. She deserves a year off to reassess, to get healthy. And to think seriously about a possibility of a run. 
>> Reporter: And the secretary is reportedly in good spirits tonight, engaging with doctors, her staff and her husband, former president bill clinton, who has been at her side. But tonight, it is unclear when she'll go home and if she'll be able to return to her full-time role at the state department before the new secretary of state is sworn in. David? 
>> If anyone deserves time out, it would be mrs. Clinton. Thank you. 
>>> We're going to turn overseas tonight and to a very rare public appearance making waves around the world. North korean leader kim jong-un, who took over from his father, has remained mysterious. Tonight, what we heard from him, we haven't heard before. Here's abc's akiko fujita now. 

[00:08:34]


>> Reporter: The new year came with fanfare in north korea. But this year, in a rare public address, kim jong-un's message was different. "This year, the entire korean nation should turn out a nation wild patriotic struggle for reunification," kim jong-un said. 
>> He's sent signals that he's going to move his country in new and different directions. This speech was that first step in that direction. 
>> Reporter: On the streets of pyongyang, residents predictably praised the first new year's address in nearly 20-year-olds. Kim jong-un's father shunned the public, speaking just once in his 17-year rule. Bpyongyang has gone to great lengths to project a modern, more outgoing image of their leader, seen here visiting an amusement park with his young wife by his side. 
>> He knows far more about the outside world than his grandfather or his father and that brings a completely new dimension to north korean leadership. 
>> Reporter: But kim's shown the same defiance as his father, successfully launching a long range rocket last month, a direct violation of u.N. Security council resolution. And he's shown no intention of abandoning pyongyang's nuclear weapons program. 
>> And akiko is with us here in new york tonight. And you talked with your experts on this. They tell you this was a message aimed right at america? 
>> Reporter: That's right. Analysts say this was an address that was addressed directly to the u.S. And south korea's new leader. With that rocket launch, we know that kim has a bigger hand at the bargaining table now. 
>> Perhaps something new afoot. Akiko, thank you. 
>>> We're going to turn to pack stan now, where gunmen in the country's volatile northwest region launched a deadly attack on a passenger van there, killing five female teachers and two health care workers. The director of the group believes they may have been targeted for their anti-polio work. 

[00:10:38]


>>> Back here at home tonight, an environmental vie sis may have been averted off the coast of alaska tonight. A coast guard flight over a drilling rig that ran aground in shallow water is showing no signs of leaks. The rig was being pulled out of sea when a rug boat line broke free. No signs of trouble yet. 
>>> We turn this evening to a story we first reported last night here, our friend and colleague at espn, hannah storm back on the air today at the rose parade after a terrifying accident at home. A propane grill exploding, setting her on fire. You might have seen some of hannah's interviews here, this one with tim tebow. She's been a great friend to this broadcast. She also anchors "sportscenter" on espn, of course. Three weeks after that explosion, her comeback, hosting today's rose parade with "good morning america's" josh elliott. Tonight, here, though, a powerful lesson and the images of hannah in the days after the explosion. And we warn you, they are difficult to look at. Hannah, can you take us back to that night? You were grilling outdoor,s, getting ready for the family? 
>> I went outside to light a propane grill. I went back inside, went out to see how hot the grill was and the flames had been blown out. The cover of the gril was open so I assumed, logically as i guess most people would be that there wouldn't be any gas in the air. Well, propane is actually heavier than air and especially in cold weather, it tends to sit on top of the grill and cool inside and underneath the grill, so, the second I relit the flame, after I turned the gas off, I relit the flame and it was a wall of fire, huge explosion. So much force that I blew the doors of the grill completely off. 
>> You said the explosion was so loud, a neighborho thought a tree came through the house? 
>> A neighbor clear across the street thought a tre had fallen through the roof. That's how loud the explosion was. It happened in a split second and immediately I was on fire, so, my hair was on fire, my chest and the whole top of my shirt was on fire. I didn't know what to do other than I'm left-handed, reach and just get the shirt off of me as quickly as possible. So, that's why my hand is so badly damaged. I yelled inside to my 15-year-old daughter, who was in the kitchen, mommy's on fire. You have to call 911. 

[00:13:06]


>> And she came outside, I know, she was one of the people who was with you every step of the way. 
>> I told her I was on fire, i asked her to call 911. Like all teenagers, she picks up her cell phone and calls 911. 
>> You went to the hospital and it wasn't until the next day you actually had a chance to see yourself. 
>> Right. The skin was burned. There were red, actually flame marks up my neck. You could tell where the flames had, you know, been licking up on my, on my neck and I was very disfigured and, you know, without hair, eyelashes, eyebr eyebrowses it was a sight to behold. 
>> You look as beautiful as ever but I know this was a tough road and you have a whole team that helps you get ready for this broadcast today. 
>> Listen, I had the access to, you know, I spent an hour in hair and makeup this morning. I have on false eyelashes. This is all fake hair. When the makeup artist brushed an eyebrow on me, I almost stood up and kissed her this morning. But it is a long -- it is a hard road for burn victims. I was by far the most fortunate person in my burn unit. 
>> Hannah, I wanted to go back to the grill. You said you turned the propane off, which would sound to me like what anyone should do, so, what more could have you done? 
>> Right, right. If your grill has been lit but the lighter did not ignite for a period of time, the chances are very good that there is a lot of propane still sitting in the area. So, just turning it off and relighting your grill isn't sufficient. You have to wait a long period of time for all of that propain to dissipate before you would try to reignite your grill. 
>> You've been amazing in turning this into a blessing and how well you've recovered and you've got a whole new year ahead of you now. 
>> Thanks. And happy new year to you, david. 
>> It was great to see hannah back on the air today. 
>>> Still much more ahead here on "world news" this new year's night. All of those new year's resolutions -- is yours getting to the gym, making a better you? Well, tonight, can you guess how many weeks most of us last when that's our resolution? me to take a centrum silver multivitamin every day. I told him, sure. Can't hurt, right? Then I heard this news about a multivitamin study looking at long-term health benefits for men over 50. The they used in that study... Centrum silver. That's what I take. My doctor! He knows his stuff. 

[00:16:09]

>> I was born in italy. My mother was born there. 
>> I was born in a small town in north italy. 
>> Well, they live in the province of peruvia, that's where they came from. 
>> My mother's people, they were born right outside of rome. 
>> My father came from a little town outside of naples called nusco. 
>> My father was born in sicily. 
>> My parents we born in italy. 
>> My grandfather died about 15 years before I was born. My grandmother about 20 years. I've always been curious about my past. 
>> Every day, each of us, knowingly or without awareness, journeys one day closer to our future and one day further from our past. Our bearing is intuitively set from our memory, for the destination of discovery. Of who we are, of why we're us. And while departure and arrival are each inevitably navigated in the fair ril us will concourse -- fair ril us will concourse -- perilous concourse of change, the passage in between can find steadfastness on the bed rock. No one has more aware of this conflict of tradition and change than the immigrants who leave everything they have ever known and everyone they ever loved to find a new life in a new country. Almost 5 million of these immigrants came to the united states from italy. The fading memory of their time helps the united states chart its course to becoming the world's pre-eminent superpower and still sharply defines the lines of many americans today. From manya mf manja, to the tara tell la and patron saints to paesani, italian ethnic heritage in northeastern pennsylvania has spanned oceans and time to create a finer life for us all. For more than a millennium, italy's 20 regions were mapped by cultural and economic disunion. During most of that time, a tragically impoverished farming culture in the south served to sustain the north's wealth and opportunity, but beginning in 1880, this boot began to walk. 

[00:02:53]


>> And my mother said all of us knew that when we reached a certain age, we would leave home and go to america. 
>> The people from the south, they are just leaving in the hundreds of thousands. It became almost a crisis situation. The italian government was very anxious about the flow of their peasant stock out of the country. You were losing the field workers. The pope got concerned abt it. The italian government had to take action. It passed an immigration law and required people to now have a passport before they could leave italy. 
>> More immigrants came to the united states from italy than from any other european country. Between 1901 and 1915, the southern region of kampana alone lost a million people. More than a million left sicily. 
>> It was a fever that overtook the italian people. They heard so many stories about gold in america, about jobs that were great, and they would say, yes, you work like a devil, but you make four times as much as you could ever make in old italy, in beautiful italy. So then it was bella it tannan, but no money. 
>> The italian immigrant literally followed the footsteps of their paesani who had already left, a practice known as chain migration. 
>> And that's why you have whole villages settling in a neighborhood in new york city, for instance, or in chicago. 

[00:05:00]


>> My father came here first. He came to the united states in 1920. Then he wrote to us that he wanted us to come to america. 
>> He had a friend working in the mines with him and said there was work available here. 
>> Often the footsteps of theue immigrants let back to italia. President woodrow wilson considered the relationship a win-win proposition. They took our dollars, he said, but they left the subways. 
>> The great nations, the nations that sent the most immigrants, italians have the highest rate of return migration, about 45%. 
>> They loved their homes in italy. They were very much attached to their families. And italian family was part of the strength of the culture. 
>> The italian immigrant was faced with this dilemma. Leave the place they loved, but that offered them no life, or go to a place they believed would give them life but not perhaps love. 
>> I was leaving my native land and my friends, all the familiar surroundings, and I was coming to a strange land. 
>> I couldn't imagine how anybody would feel, coming to a strange town, didn't know how far away they were going, and how many days it took them to get here. 
>> He sold his donkey and his horse and just got on a ship to america. 
>> My father came here in 1914 with his parents. My mother came here a little later. 

[00:07:04]


>> My father came very early. He came in 1900. 
>> We came to the united states in october 1933. 
>> I left italy when I was 14. 
>> My dad was 19 years old when he came here. 
>> My mother was 14 and my father was 25. They came over separately, around 1900. My mother came with her father and her mother and a sister and a brother. 
>> When I left italy, I was 13 years old. 
>> My grandfather left when he was 11 years old with his parents in 1907. 
>> My father came by himself. 
>> My father came here at the age of 16, came alone. 
>> Whether man or woman, boy or girl, 6, 16, or 60, every italian leaving italy had to get to a port city such as genoa in the north or naples in the south. 
>> It was quite a distance from the seaside. 
>> I wondered how he was able to get from that mountain town down into naples to get on the boat. 
>> The peasants had never been out of their hometowns. They had never seen the sea, some people. 
>> And in those days, they didn't have a suitcase or what they called a valise. Everything was put into a cotton bag and sewed. Some of the important things were the prayer book, a rosary. 

[00:09:28]


>> We left with our oxen cart, a handmade cart. We got the train to go to naples. 
>> We left by train and we went to venice. And then we went to genoa. 
>> The italians considered genoa to be their great port, not naples. So the best ships in the italian line were sailing out of genoa. The steamship lines began to send their old worn-out ships to serve naples. A port like naples was dangerous. You have peasants arriving in a big city. There were crooks, italian crooks who wanted to fleece them. 
>> Of all the physical and emotional adversity, the italian immigrant would encounter, their odyssey would begin with perhaps the hardest adversity of all. Saying goodbye. 
>> The hardest part was leaving grandma. It was hard. Grandma was always there to take care of us. I promised that every week, I'll write to her. So that made her happy, you know. My grandma died before we went back. 
>> My father was only about 8 years old when he came. And my father never saw his mother again. 
>> I find it challenging at best to think about picking up stakes, leaving everything behind. 

[00:11:28]


>> Steamships replaced sailing VESSELS BY THE 1880s. A ticket cost more, but if there were no stops at other ports, the trip across the atlantic ocean was shorter. 
>> We got on the boat in naples and the name of the boat was voltalia. It took us about 12, 13 days to get to america. 
>> The ship was the patria from naples to new york city. It was 30 days at sea. 
>> It was called the homeland. It was an old ship. It wobbled. It wasn't very steady. 15 days now on the water. 
>> Moithss paid the least -- immigrants paid the least expensive fare and were assigned to the area of the ship closest to the rudder, known as steerage. 
>> And he said you can't imagine how big the atlantic ocean is until you're in steerage. 
>> There was nothing nice about this. There's tons of people all together. 
>> If you were neapolitan or sicilian, you wanted to stay with others who are sicilian or neapolitan. You had one group of all males, the group of the wives or betrothed women coming to their fiance. Then you had families, so you had quite a mixed group sometimes coming across the sea. With different things to think about in their minds as they slept at night or tried to. 
>> It was a very crowded ship and if anybody got sick, the germs traveled around the ship. 

[00:13:32]


>> Vomit often from the seasickness. 
>> Father got smallpox. 
>> He had a terrible trip on the boat. He said it was very, very dirty. And he picked up some kind of a rash, it disfigured his face terrible. 
>> I was sick about maybe ten days out of the 15 days, seasick. 
>> It was so cold. And we were really sick. Couldn't eat nothing. 
>> People were often not that well nourished anyway, so they really weren't in the best physical condition when they were traveling. Sometimes in steerage nearby, an area not too far away from you, there were horses and other animals. 
>> The conditions were terrible. Food was sparse. It was almost put into a hold in the ship because we took a little too much water. 
>> People climbed to the steerage deck. Imagine how stunned they were to see the blue water. 
>> There's a lot of water, a lot of water. 
>> He had to hold his sister so she wouldn't get -- go overboard because the sea was so rough. 
>> You always think as you're in the middle of the ocean and all you see is sky and water and then you feel like as though there's going to be a drought. There's nothing there, but just this boat and the water. 

[00:15:34]


>> Well, when we start seeing the statue of liberty, I tell you, you just touching a little bit of the torch, and they say, ahh, we finally arrived. She said as long as there's music on the ship. It was so exciting. 
>> We were so happy. 
>> In 1892, ellis island opened adjacent to the statue of liberty in lower new york harbor. In the next 30 years, the facility processed about 12 million immigrants. Between 1901 when construction of the existing complex of buildings was completed and 1910, an average of 50,000 immigrants a month would pass through the station. Ellis island was created by the american government to more effectively respond to the growing number of europeans coming to the united states. 
>> And what they responded to very early was the italians. And it was a negative response. 
>> They didn't know how many they would take and they might take a certain amount of people and then send the rest back. 
>> Dr. Joseph henry fenner was appointed to be commissioner here. He was delighted with the germans coming, the english, the french, the swedes, the dutch, and the northern italian. But then he saw the southern italians and he set up cages where huge groups, particularly of italians, were locked because he saw them as dirty. If you couldn't show you had enough money on the spot, like, you know, you only had two dollars, you should have ten or more, he would immediately slate you for exclusion or deportation. 

[00:17:43]


>> Before discharge, you had to meet ese customs inspections. All the bags were opened, you had to stand there waiting an hour or two while all this went on. 
>> He was 8 years old when he came over with his sister. They came through ellis island. 
>> And they both came across by themselves with nobody with them. She was going to find out where she was supposed to be and where to go, so she told him, you stay here with the suitcases. And he got scared, I guess, and he ran after her. When they went back, everything was gone. They didn't have nothing but the clothes they had on their backs. 
>> And all this was done, immigration officers said good to the customs men and the immigration office is now in full control. 
>> He looked at your skin, your face, your hair, he look at your fingers. And any sign of tuberculosis anywhere, the way you walked, breathing, intelligence, awareness of what's happening to you. If you had a shocked look or lost look, he might wonder and ask you a few questions to make sure that you are all there mentally. Do you know where you're going? How old are you? Can you count? Do you know the difference between a pig and a cow? How long was your journey by sea? Can you draw me a horse? If there were any serious signs of any illness, the doctor had a piece of chalk and he would write on your coat or on your jacket a code letter. A "x" meant they thought you might have mental problems. "H" was for heart. "L" lameness, "g" goiter. "V" for vision, "f" was something wrong with the face. 

[00:19:59]


>> Before leaving ellis island, immigrants had to demonstrate there was somebody already living in the united states who would help them get established. 
>> They had to have a sponsor. If you didn't have a response, so you couldn't come to this country. 
>> My father was a sponsor for us to come to this country. 
>> Italian immigrants without families or friends already in america would hire a sponsor, known as a padrone. 
>> Some really did more good and some didn't do good at all. He was your guide. They provided you with everything you needed to get into the country. He would calm your nerves, did all the translation, have directions to the lodging house or boarding house that he had set up for you, the italian one. But in the end, you had to pay for it. In the end, he made you pay and pay big. You had to pay part of your salary to him, however long it look too re-fay. 
>> The majority of italian moithss rooted in three states, new york, new jersey, and pennsylvania. By 1930, almost 10% of northeastern pennsylvania's population was italian. 
>> Those trains were outbound and were also bringing back people. 
>> Took a train to strous berg. 
>> Weighed to come to hazleton because he had friends up here from his hometown. 
>> They put him on a train and his friend met him at the train station just about maybe a half a mile from where he's buried now. 
>> Italian immigrants faced sobering challenges to establishing a new life in america. Among them was integrating with the existing population, many who were once immigrants themselves. 
>> I look at them as nor or less superior to -- more or less superior to us because they knew the english language. 
>> There where we lived, someone had burned a cross. 

[00:22:02]


>> The italian immigration, particularly those by the southern italian, was a real surprise for americans. They didn't mind the few italians. It lent a certainexotic feeling, but when you have 250,000 coming a year, that's a problem. 
>> When they thought of southern italians, the darker people, there was some sense of puzzlement and question. Are they a different race, was the question. These don't look like italians. They were used to the northern italians. There was an argument, there are two italian races. This was a big issue because america felt itself to be a white anglo-saxon protestant nation, which it was, which it was. 
>> I know a couple people that really didn't care for me because I was italian. And you felt that and you knew that. 
>> Few, if any, immigrants ever arrived anywhere without having to endure racial and ethnic slurs. Italians were taunted with wop. 
>> The italians thought that was the english word for italian. Another word that was popular was dago. It was originally from diago which is the spanish for james and that actually comes from england to mean all the mediterranean people. 
>> And the americans embraced this expression. 
>> At the start of the 20th century, northeastern pennsylvania's industrial didn't echoed around -- din echoed around the world and italians heard it and were drawn to it's lure of a better life. 
>> There were sights and smells and dust and it was a very alive, very vibrant area, particularly scranton as the anthracite capital of the world. 

[00:24:28]


>> Scranton had one of the largest trolley systems in america. By 1913, the scranton trolley system was carrying 3 million passengers a year. 
>> Of course, lackawanna avenue was the commercial center. It was a bustling place. You had to shop daily to get your produce, your meat and your fish, or vegetables. There was no refrigeration, but it was not -- there was refrigeration, but it was not widespread and so sthrfs a lot of foot traffic. There was a lot of wagon traffic. 
>> All those various languages that were being spoken. The attempt at communication between people must have been amazing. The 1870 census, scranton was one of the most multi cultural places in america. It was exceeded only by chicago, san francisco, and milwaukee. 50% of scranton's population in 1870 claim foreign birth, so it was phenomenally multicultural. 
>> The towns of ross set to, jet sup, olds forge, pittston, dunnmore and taylor were the most intensive italian communities in the region. 
>> The neighborhood was strictly italian. Every home several blocks around. 
>> In old forge, we had different kinds of italians. We had the people from filippo near salo, and then there was a calabria section and the people from nape pes, they were in another section. 

[00:26:42]


>> Whole streets are whole buildings might be sicilian or maybe if they're northern italians. 
>> A lot of neighborhoods that are italian, you have me neapolitan, sicilian, but here in bunker hill, basically all the people came from that same mountain village outside of naples. They were neighbors and friends over there, they moved over here and same thing. Like they transported part of the neighborhood over here. 
>> Rosetto was 100% italian. That's how it originated its name, from the name in italy. 
>> You came and went with people you knew, either your family or your friends. In my dad's case, it was friend, so he had a lot of paesani. So paesano is someone who comes from your hometown. It's a very enduring word. Maybe everybody on our street came from the same place. 
>> This young about you're a paesano, someone from your part of italy. 
>> The americans looked at them and said, italians? You're italian, aren't you? Where are you from? Italy, you're italian. Italians had to get used to a new identity, and actually, they resisted. The first generation generally didn't think that much of it. To them, yeah, the americans called us italian, but we're really from somewhere, you know, that's more than important than italy as a whole. It's the real country. 
>> They associated with each other, the italian people, because not all the people associated with the natives, the americans. 
>> They had their own grocers and bash -- bar percent, the church, the funeral far lors. It was a self sufficient italian neighborhood. 

[00:28:46]


>> They opened shops selling outline the foods of the old country, olive oil, salami, sweet sho, cheese makers. 
>> There are all sorts of businesses who understood the needs and plights and troubles of the italians. It was a unique situation. 
>> Many other communities, however, were more ethnically diverse. And enriched. 
>> Where we lived, the area was called the patch. We're going up to the patch. They were all italians with the exception of one russian and one polish family. 
>> I'll tell you about those polish and russian. They were born and raised in this neighborhood, all italians. They could speak the italian language better than some of us. 
>> We had italians, polish, russian, and then we had some english and irish. 
>> The lower section was always the irish and up here was always the italians. 
>> The whole town was friendly. You could leave your doors open at night and go to bed, nothing was locked. 
>> It was a wonderful place to live. 
>> It was like a family town. If one got sick, the neighbors would wash their clothes and bring food for them. If one cried, everybody cried. If somebody sneezed, everyone got a hand kerchief out. 
>> And everybody was our parents. You don't something wrong in the street, get home, you. You had to go home. They say mom, so and so hollered at me. What did you go over there for? Get in the house. 
>> We had trucks that were peddle through the streets. Toot the horn and they knew he was there. 

[00:30:54]


>> Old forge and the ports across the street, one car could only go through. 
>> We were always out there, the whole gang, boys, girls. We'd just talk. 
>> My noer was born and raise -- noer was born and raised in the home he said and my mother me -- homestead and my mother never lived anywhere but the. 
>> That's all you knew. 
>> The people who lived in northeastern pennsylvania knew another fact of life. Far beneath their homes were the largest deposits of anthracite coal in the world. 
>> My mother's brother was living in scranton and he says come out here, there's a lot of work here. He came here and wound up in the mines. And he became a miner and for years, he worked in the mines. 
>> The vast preponderance of those jobs were in an industry that came to be referred to as the black hell. 
>> This was an alien environment. It was back-breaking. What little light you had was provided by a headlamp or carbide lamp attached to your canvas cap. You are loading coal cars eight, ten, 12 hours a day, ton afton. 
-- Ton after ton. 
>> That was about the only employment at the time. He worked in the mines all his life. It was a rough life. 

[00:32:59]


>> All the good jobs were given out to the people that knew the language. All the italians or the foreigners, polish, russian, couldn't get the jobs they got because they couldn't speak the language. 
>> He had no trade. That's why they came to this country. They went into the mines. Nothing else they could have done. 
>> The first immigrant groups had risen to become a mine foreman, mine bosses, and in some cases the owners of the mines and the factories. And so as those new immigrants showed up, they were given some of the most dangerous jobs to do, some of the most difficult and dirty jobs. You were the new kid on the block, you weren't going to get the best location. You were going to get the worst location. 
>> Oh, yeah, they were looked down on. 
>> You were kind of shoehorned into some of the tightest, most difficult places underground. 
>> I really didn't know the hazards of the job. 
>> Nobody really imagined what it is like working in the nines. 
>> My grandfather was injured in the coal mines in an accident where he was caught between two coal cars. He was, you know, never really the same after that. He suffered from black lung. 
>> In the town we lived in, there was a coal mine and whenever the mine would sound out the siren, you could hear it through the whole town. You knew there was something happened in the mine. When the women, they hear this sound, they would run over to e area to see who got hurt, who got killed. 

[00:35:09]


>> Most boysin the region had no choice but to work in the anthracite industry. Some, however, saw life differently. 
>> It's a custom in italy that when a boy reaches about the age of 13, it is important that he learn a trade. At the age of 13, my father said I can't afford to educate you. You have to learn a trade. My brother-in-law, who was from italy and a shoe maker, drove me downt to a tailor and he said to the tai lo, this is going to be -- tailor, this is ng to be the apprentice. I cried with my mother for two weeks. And she said to me, maurice, there's nothing I can do. This is the wish of your father. Eventually, I began to pick it up very fast. My mother bought her first washing machine when I was rn in 1925 and I bought her her second washing machine. 
>> My father, he didn't want me to be on the streets, so he made arrangements with a shoe maker for me to go there and spend time or learn the trade, and i gave my money to my mother. 
>> Dogmatic tradition and the practicality of commonly having so many children prevented many italian women from holding jobs outside the home. But some did. 
>> My mother did house work for people that were not italian, and she didn't even know the language. 
>> My mother was a seam stress. She made all of th boys clothes without pattern. She also worked in a dress factory. 

[00:37:20]


>> In italian culture, family is an ethos, a guiding belief, sheer bed rock. 
>> The italian faenl is the major part of the -- family is the major part of the story of immigration. The italian family is very strong and very important. The individual belongs to the family. His honor was not important individually, but the family honor was everything. 
>> We were always brought up to respect our elders. The family was the focal point of our life. 
>> Respect, to me, describes the parents. They demanded that, you know, and when they said something, you respected that. Not like today. You know, we didn't say -- when they said no, we didn't ask why. It was no. 
>> They were strict, real strict. You have to wear shorts in the summertime, and when it's 4:00, you have to get upstairs and get your clothes on because pop doesn't want to see you with shorts on. You have to put a dress on. 
>> He was very strict with us, kept a close watch on us and made sure we walk the right line. You went off the line, then you heard it quick. 
>> My father was a happy-go-lucky guy. Never, never scolded us or give us a slap. His house was everybody's house. 
>> My dad's first name was primo and he was the first-born. He felt that responsibility and my dad worked in the mines and he supported his family in italy. >> The italian family was such as it is partly because of the roman catholic teaching. The church teaches the father is the head just as christ is the head. Very strong, this is taught and inculcated over generations. They want to adhere to what the church teaches, they want to adhere to what the priest says. But nonetheless, the mother is kind of sacred too. You see the mother of god and the symbol of perfection in women. So this lifts the mother up to a certain glory. 

[00:39:48]


>> My mother couldn't read or write english, but she knew everything. 
>> My mother was over 200 pounds, but she wasn't fat. My mother was stocky. 
>> The mother also runs the house. She gets the paycheck, even the money. 
>> The italian men ruled the house, but the women ruled the pockets. 
>> She gives allowance to her husband. She maintains the house. He makes the money and mama, that was the culture. 
>> Men went to work, that was the job and they were finished. The women did everything in the home. They were never done. 
>> Her job was washing clothes. We didn't have a washer, had to wash them by hand. 
>> But my mother was a workhorse are the house. She was a fabulous cook. There wasn't one day that I went to school that my mother didn't give me a white shirt and starched collars, crisp. Every day of the week, she did that. 
>> My mom never even knew how to grocery shop. My father did the grocery shopping. 
>> Now, of course, you ha some bossier husbands, most husbands are letting their wives define most of what went on in the household. 
>> She was very caring to us. She was strict, but I know a lot of times she did things for us that my father didn't know. 
>> As soon as he raised his voice, they all tried to placate him, say okay, okay, make him feel good. 
>> My father really never said very much and my mother was the cultural one. 
>> My father ruled with an iron hand and I mean with an iron hand. He was strict with my mother too. 

[00:41:53]


>> He wouldn't use an electric razor. I was provided by the lackawanna heritage valley, a partnership of government, business, civic organizations and individuals dedicated to the development of historical, cultural, natural, and economic resources through preservation, education, and promotion of the lackawanna valley's heritage. The scranton unico foundation and the unico national foundation, contributing to the well-being of our communities by making significant contributions to charities. They strive to honor, perpetuate and disseminate the cultural and ethnic culture by supporting the local communities and nation. Additional funding for faes scene was provided by la festa italia lackawanna. Come enjoy the music and food, the culture. Did we say food? One of the country's largest italian festivals every labor day weekend in downtown scranton. And the chris and ann demateo family. 

[01:02:02]


>>> Poverty didn't entirely elude italians who came to america, but in ways beyond the material, they were far from bereft. 
>> They were very poor, but they were proud. 
>> We weren't rich. We were poor. 
>> There were many a month when we couldn't pay the rent and it was only $25 a month. 
>> Just enough money to pay for the food that we ate. That's all there was to it. 
>> There was no tv. We listened to the radio. 
>> This is nbc 
[ nbc tones ] ?????? [ singing ] ?????? 
>> when two people got married, they moved close to their parents. 
>> My sister got married and she lived next-door. Then the other sister got married and she lived across the street. My one sister was upstairs. My mother was tap on the pipe, the steam pipe for my sister to come down and get whatever she made. 
>> Then next-door to my sister, my uncle lived. My cousins, they came to my mother's house all the time. 
>> With italian families, a tenth cousin is like a brother or sister, and then you have close friends who became cousins just because they were here so much and they actually became a part of your family . 
>> They were always at each other's house. And my uncle enjoyed walking in our house, and if we weren't behaving or something, he come in and give you a couple slaps and then walk out, didn't say a word. 
>> My mom's mother lived two blocks up the road. I would never go by that house without stopping in. You have to do it. 

[01:04:09]


>> Both sets of grandparents lived a block away. 
>> There may be no more manifest measure of the passage of time in northeastern pennsylvania than that of a large family and italian families could be big. 
>> Our kitchen table, don't forget, there's nine people going to sit at that table. That's if you didn't have company. 
>> Every household had a minimum of about five children. Ours up to eight, nine, ten in a family. 
>> Five. Five boys and five girls and one bathroom upstairs. One bathroom. At first we didn't have a bathroom. We had to go to the outside toilet. 
>> Four girls and three boys. 
>> I have two sisters born in italy, and then my father had five more kids here. He had a boy, then he had a girl, then he had three boys. And we're not counting the ones that passed away during -- at birth. 
>> I had seven sisters and one brother, and we were referred to as two thorns among seven roses. 
>> No disposable diapers, no pediatricians to pick up the phone. I just -- I'm amazed at how they did it. I have no idea. 
>> One bedroom had two single beds. My sisters and I laid down ov one single bed and my other two sisters in the other one. Once a week, we take a bath. Once a week, that's all. She had to boil water on the stove all the time. I wonder how we did it. 
>> My grandfather was killed, my father's family, they had to quit school because they had to help run these homes of ten children. How did they manage that then? There were ten, 12 kids back in those days with one man working. But they did it, and they did it with love. 

[01:06:26]


>> My grandfather, who had eight children and very hard to feed in those days, would never consider going on welfare. They thought that that was taking away from the government, so they had to make it on their own. 
>> We were always there for each other. 
>> The italian family becomes formed by a robust range of traditions and customs that span the culture's collective memory and diverse dialects. 
>> Italian tradition played a big part in my life. I tried to stick to the high moral standards, for one thing. 
>> We were brought up in italy, it was always work. Home, church. Grandma used to say, in the morning you go for yourself and the one later, you go for for your father because he lived in america and in case he didn't go today, you fay for your father. 
>> I got my italianness from in the house. 
>> Because I married an italian girl, we did not sway too far away from our traditions. 
>> Theyalways had the white shirt and they always had a tie on. And I can always remember them walking down the street and tipping their hat to the ladies. 
>> Being italian, I think I was prone to appreciate beauty. 
>> The music, speaking the language, the cooking as italians used to say. Ma, how do you make this? My mother is the way you do this and this is what you do that. 

[01:08:34]


>> My mother was a terrific cook. We had the most delicious meals when we were growing up. They never had a lot of money, but there was always a big meal on the table. 
>> We had a stockade in the back, the italians called it an stockato and we had goats, chickens, rabbits. 
>> My father used to raise piggies to make the lard, make cracklings, pork chops and sausage. 
>> Of course, my grandfather made his own proscuitto, his own salami. He was living all notices like he was a farmer back -- all notices like he was a farmer back home. 
>> My father gardened a lot, my mother gardened a lot. My father used to play the metropolitan opera broadcasts. 
>> Everybody had a garden. Everybody. And they lived really off their garden. 
>> We had to do the digging before we went to school. We had to dig our share. 
>> We would grow savoy cabbage. In the fall we would bury that and in the winter, when you couldn't buy it anywhere else, we'd go down and dig one out and cook it. 
>> My mother, she made bread every other day for ten kids. She would get up at 3:00 in the morning, knead the bread. 
>> Food in italian families is a big part of our life. Every sunday, 2:00, we have dinner here. 
>> Which is typical to italy where they have tir paranzo late and it's their main meal on a sunday. 
>> We would always have a sunday meal at our house. Chicken and macaroni were there every sunday evening for supper. 

[01:10:39]


>> Salad was after the meal. I was corrected about that when I went to italy. 
>> They have their pasta first, then they have their meat. 
>> We never brought butter to a table because everything tasted so good, we didn't need the butter. 
>> As we were eating, my father would use it as an occasion to quiz us about what state that we had just eaten looked like and what was the capital of that state. 
>> We did not touch a morsel of food until my father sat at the table. 
>> We ate spaghetti every day. My father and sister, we had to have pasta every single day. Two days with tomato sauce and the other days, we were eating old vegetables. The pasta with string beans, pasta with green beans. 
>> My mother, every time i brought the modern pasta machine, she would always say, oh, grandma would kill us if she ever saw us using a machine. Back in those days, everything was done by hand. 
>> Pasta was, was a must several times a week, but sunday, it was always there. And the sauce in those days, they started early in the morning. 
>> If we don't have sauce, my son goes through withdrawal. My mother would start her sauce with fatback. 
>> I always liked sauce, like my mother used to make it, that's how you get good sauce. 
>> Certain kinds of italians make a different sauce forhe table. My mother is italian and some people would feel differently about the sauce that they made. 

[01:12:40]


>> I make all kinds of sauce, meat sauce, vodka sauce. 
>> A lot of garlic. Garlic is the key. Garlic and olive oil and then you're set. There's always olive oil in my cooking. There's nothing like the flavor of olive oil and when my mother made pasta, my father would have the olive oil on the table and he liked to drizzle a little olive oil after it was all done on that. 
>> The only thing we don't use the garlic on is ice cream. 
>> There's a lot of great things that go with that little piece of garlic. It's my middle name. 
>> The only time you have dessert is on the weekend. Desserts is a big thing on sunday and holidays. 
>> We got the cookie that they dunk in the wine, soften them up. In the wine is much better than expresso. That was the favorite. We still do that. 
>> My mother used to make a lot of cookies. 
>> This house was never, never without biscotti. 
>> Margie, my niece, she loves biscotti. Her husband loved biscottis. And canoli 
>> and I only fill them when i need them because you fill a cannoli up and you leave it there, the shell gets soft and soggy and who wants to eat that. You want something crunchy. 
>> There's nothing like cooking for family and friends. 
>> It was a full genuine italian day. 
>> Italian immigrants gave up some customs easier than others. One value thenned to hold on to -- they wanted to hold on to was the life blood of their culture, their language 

[01:14:52]


[ speaking italian ] what happened I said was I speak italian because I am italian. 
[ Singing in italian ] 
>> back when I was in grade school, I spoke broken english, but I had to go to the men's room and I told the teacher i had to go the (italian word). 
>> Italian all the time, in the house, wherever we went, and we spoke italian a lot. Oh, yeah. We had to speak italian. 
>> My grandparents, my great grandparents did not speak, you know, quote-unquote, the italian language. They spoke a calabrais dialect. 
>> When I went to school, i couldn't talk english. I could only talk italian. 
>> I was with a younger group all the time and I was the old one. 
>> The kids start snickering. You say something and it doesn't come out right. 
>> I never knew it until later, later years, but I didn't pass the first grade. I imagine it was because i couldn't speak english. 
>> Quite a few people that came from our town, the castanellis, they all spoke italian. It was easier tok italian to them than english. Little by little, they picked up the language. 
>> In an era absence of contemporary society's surplus of diversions, italians entertained themselves with each other. 
>> It was like a normal thing to us to be visiting aunss and uncles -- aunts and uncles back in those days. We visited two, three times a week. Whether I was bored out of my mind sitting on that couch waiting for us to leave, we went. We don't do that today. I miss that. 

[01:16:52]


>> Every sunday, we had to go to the aunts and uncles' house. We jump in this truck, the truck only had one seat in it. My mother had to sit on a wooden box. 
>> They used to gather on a sunday, your aunts and uncles would come over. As soon as they came in the house, you offered them either a glass of wine first and something to eat. 
>> Before we even got in the house, we had to make sure that we kissed everybody at that table. 
>> My aunt's sister was my godmother and when she came over, you practically had to adore him. They used to call her the countess. 
>> There was also either cookies or the biscotti or there was always dessert or cheese or fruit or the coffee came out. 
>> She always had a pot of coffee on the stove, all the time. I couldn't make my own coffee. My mother would put the coffee there and she would put the milk in it and the sugar in. I said, ma, I don't want no milk in my coffee. You got to have milk, you're italian. You have to have milk and sugar in the could have me. 
>> If italian mothers could be particular about how their sons took their coffee, italian fathers focused their attention on their daughters. 
>> When somebody would bring home somebody that was not italian, they didn't like the at all. 
>> The big question in my family was, oh, is he italian? So that was really the question. 
>> We had a time limit that we had to get home. 
>> Many a time I had to sneak in without waking my father. Sometimes I got by. 
>> We had to have them meet the father. You didn't have them meet your parents when they were ready to have a boyfriend. You had to have them meet the parents to go on a first date. And the only reason why I was allowed to have a date in my freshman year of high school was because he knew the family. See, if they knew the family:. 

[01:19:15]


>> First generation, they only wanted to marry italian. Usually from the same part of italy they came from. 
>> My grandfather, he said gina is a wonderful girl, too bad she's calabrese. 
>> The family wanted us to marry around. 
>> Marry italians, they preached that. 
>> St. Lucy's church was all italian. Everybody that got married, they married an italian. 
>> My wife was byzantine and when I was going with her, a friend of theirs said to my mother-in-law, you mean to tell me you're going to let your daughter marry an italian? 
>> In some italian families the young lovers were allowed only three visits between the engagement announcement and the wedding, all chaperoned with no touching. That may not have been such a bad deal when they considered the alternative. 
>> Arranged marriages were always done. The father would neat a nice young fellow. 
-- Meet a nice young fellow. You want to marry my daughter? I'll give you my daughter, she's a nice girl. She's 15, 17, 18 years old, time for her to get married. So he would write a letter to the ma ma. I have a perfect young man and he's going to pay the fare and she's going to get married. 
>> My mother came over here to get married. My sister anna asked her the question, she said how could you come here and marry somebody you never knews? She said you learn to love them as you go along. 
>> When she found a husband, i think she was about 15 and not only her, almost all the girls in that town. 
>> It was second generation, many of them wanted to marry outside of the italian ethnicity, felt they wanted to be american, they wanted to be accepted. 
>> But my parents were very liberal. They never told us who we should pick. But I married an italian girl. 

[01:21:22]


>> Italian weddings reflected both the immigrants' spare means and bountiful pride. 
>> The whole neighborhood got invited. The bridal party usually consists of your relatives. We used to make our own sandwiches and bring them to the hall, and have sandwiches and drinks. 
>> I remember lots of sandwiches. Lots of liquor and lots of singing. 
>> The bridesmaid would pass the cookies around. 
>> The father of the bride wanted to give his daughter the best wedding possible. 
>> And they would help us cook. It was just in my mom's kitchen. 
>> The italian kitchen was the epicenter of the italian family. For an obvious reason. 
>> There was always a pot of sauce on and there was always something being cooked. When you walked into the house, you could smell that rich cooking and it just was very inviting for you to head right to the kitchen before you went anywhere else. 
>> Anyone that came to visit, you ended up at the kitchen around the table. All italians have big tables. 
>> And that's where I heard so many of these great stories and that's my fondest recollections,us being around the table. 
>> Everyone is there together and this is when everyone can converse, say what's on their mind, whatever, but the whole ily is there. 
>> We had a parlor. I never sat in the parlor. We never sat in the parlor. 

[01:23:26]


>> There was one corner of the table I always sit in. I go to my mother's house and go in there and sit down. 
>> It was a loving gathering. 
>> A less loving legacy of italian culture dates back 2,000 years before there was an italy. 
>> We would get head aches if we didn't feel well. 
>> Grandmother would do a ceremony or something on our head. 
>> And if they yaund, they would say they were talking away, somebody was jealous of you. 
>> My mother says somebody gave you the evil eye. 
>> When people came to your house and meant you harm, they threw salt. And they also had expressions with their hands, like do that evil eye. 
>> Among italian culture's most verence practices is saying goodbye to their loved ones. 
>> A lot of times growing up, it was hard to watch. Italians are very emotional people and when they love, they love hard. 
>> Have dramatic and very emotional. They dressed in black. 
>> Some people wore black until they died. They worn it all their life. 
>> That's true. It meant that they had a lot of pain for who they lost. 
>> When mydfather passed away, we weren't allowed to turn that tv on for six months. We wanted to see it as children and we were taught this was mother's father who died and you have to respect the dead. 
>> Every day, they would go to church and pray for that person and they get on their knees and pray that the person is happy. Because it was just in them. It was in their hearts. Their love for the person that passed a way. 

[01:25:26]


>> They were so richly catholic, it was inescapable. 
>> Making the sign of the cross was an automatic thing. You had to go to mass, you had to fast, eat fish on friday, no naet. You had to adhere. 
>> Church was a very, very strong part of the family. The tradition of going to church on sunday and then we went back to church for sunday school, and then in the evening, we went back for the benediction. 
>> My grandmother had her rosary, no matter where she went. 
>> We had to go to church, the kids. We had to go to religion. It didn't matter. We walked in any kind of snow, in any kind of weather, we had to walk to church. Church was always. 
>> My grandma said to us, come on, let's go walking. The first thing she asked, do you go to church? He said yes. 
>> My father was very much a church-goer. My mother was very atholic. She would get up every morning to go to church, every morning. 
>> Mass wasn't the only path for the italian immigrants' pursuit of divine attention. 
>> Probably more important than church were saints. 
>> I do pray to st. Jude, my favorite saint. 
>> We had to go to st. Lucy every week. 
>> And st. Ann. 
>> My mother started praying to st. Ann. 
>> And st. Ary. 
>> Sometimes I pray to different saints. 
>> Praying to st. Antonio. 
>> They have a rosary every week to st. Rocco. 
>> And st. Josephine and on that day, my dad would come home with pass tri in honor of the saints. 

[01:27:35]


>> The holiday, the past becomes the present and for a time, time symptoms. 
>> But the holidays were the most important part of the year. In italian tradition, everybody got to come back home. We always had the family together. No matter what, rain, snow, whatever shine, that's what makes it so nice. 
>> Christmas, first of all, st. Patrick. 
>> It was a joy. When we got up in the morning, we kissed my father's -- the back of my father's hand and the back of my mother's hand. 
>> Christmas. That's the nicest part of the year. 
>> The cooking brings the family together for the holidays. 
>> Christmas eve, the way it always started, 5:00, we started eating. The fish soup. And the big antipasto comes out and then all the fish. 
>> Cal amari, smelt, eel. 
>> And I recall recall these eels jumping in the frying pan. They were alive. 
>> One of them that was a staple was the bacala. That was salted carp. 
>> After the dinner there was the cannolis. 
>> We used to wait for christmas because we got together and all the kids all in the same house. 
>> Everyone always had a little gift, no matter how bad things were, everybody had a gift to open. 

[01:29:39]


>> My mother, she'd hang the stockings and she'd put nuts in there, an orange, and at the bottom, there would be money. 
>> Easter also was a very big holiday and we had these easter pies, sausage pies and grain pies. 
>> Ravioli were our italian dish for easter. 
>> The family would contribute to it. One sister would bring one part of the meal and another one another part of the meal. 
>> The priest used to come and bless our house. 
>> The holidays were beautiful. No matter how poor you were. 
>> The era of the first italian immigrants is now three generations in the past. But the values they brought with them to northeastern pennsylvania remain resounding. 
>> When we were kids, our picnic was a biggest thing there. The only time we were allowed to stay out late was on sunday night when they have the fireworks. 
>> They would invite a team from jessup, a team from pittston, and there was opera with no music and they would compete with each other, but they would only compete to drink and eat. 
>> On sundays, the neighborhoods would get together and my father played a guitar and they would come with the accordion and sing, and it was strictly, strictly italian. 
>> My dad used to sing a lot of songs about love. When I was older, I said all this music, it's all that love. He said what is there in life but good food, good music, and love. 
>> My grandfather was a cornett player. He would get two or three musicians and they would go serenading and the next thing you know, the drinks start coming around. There was a spaghetti going and they used to do that almost every sunday. 

[01:31:47]


>> Each neighborhood normally had their own club. It was a place they could socialize, get together, be with their own kind. And they also carried out their traditions there. 
>> The only way you could be a member is you have to be either an italian or married to an italian. 
>> They wouldn't take any other nationality. 
>> My noer used to like to -- mother used to like to play cards. After the dinner and everything, she was clearing the table and she would get the cards. 
>> My father used to play the games. 
>> Then my father would sit down and put the wine away. Drink the wine until they got happy. 
>> Wine-making to me is much more than just making the wine. It's a direct link to my own past and to my heritage. Wine-making in our family was brought here by my great grandfather. Vito. 
>> There is nothing better, even for medicinal purposes, than homemade wine. 
>> We were great wine makers. Still make wine. 
>> My father made a lot of wine. He was a winemaker. 
>> We all drank it. It was good for you. They all did. The whole town all made their own wine. 
>> And then what they called the pressed thin stems were put into a still and it came out as grappa. 

[01:33:50]


>> It's not about the alcoholic effect. It just becomes part of life and part of the experience at the table. 
>> Aculturation is a word no italian immigrant likely ever heard of, but its impact on their lives defined a trail on which they experienced their extraordinary journey. 
>> Aculturation to american ways was painful to many italians. They really did struggle with it. 
>> Their laughter marked with their ways and manners, women were known for their resistance. 
>> My mother couldn't speak english, you know, so she didn't associate too much with the neighbors. 
>> Dad embraced italy. He made me feel important to be italian. Told me of the beauty of italy. 
>> The children were on the streets playing with all these other children and they would then go to school and they would come home with all these stories, teacher said. Teacher said my name is clara, you know. It's josephine. 
>> She asked me what my first name was and I told her santina and she didn't like it, so she said we'll call you tina. 
>> My uncle had a nickname because he came from rome. Some they call dominique forgia, he came from forgia. 
>> Some got through easier because thenned to be americans. 
>> -- They wanted tosh americans. 
>> Dad told it like it is. If you come to america you have to work in order to have a good life. It's not just coming and finding something, you know, that everybody is going to give you. 

[01:35:59]


>> My father and his siblings, that generation wanted to put a little bit of distance maybe between italian and become american quicker. 
>> In italy, I was like a feather in the wind. You don't know what it's going to do. But somehow, the atmosphere in this country was a little different. Once I got here and I went to school, my whole attitude changed. 
>> They felt that they left their country to make a better life for themselves and they wanted to make this their home. 
>> We never used the word italian-american. My parents always felt they were americans. 
>> My dad was, even though he was an american italian, he thought just like his, you know, the old italians. 
>> My mom was born here. Her parents came -- I think early on, so they were more the american italians and I always felt my father was an italian american. It just seemed like a difference. 
>> Italians that really came from italy, like my grandfather, were much more stricter than the american italians. The italian-americans, I think their values and what they knew and what they believed in, you can never break through it. Like that was it. 
>> Italian immigrations posed numerous problems for american immigration authorities. Starting with their names. 
>> They couldn't handle a name like that. So his name became louis brown. 

[01:38:00]


>> My mother came through ellis island, she had a brother here and a sister and were supposed to meet them in new york. When they got there, they couldn't locate her, so they told them that she wasn't on that boat. There was a mistake in the name. 
>> And the difference between the brognia and the brogna was the spelling. 
>> My father's name was frank and my mother's name was francis. 
>> We took the "i" out and made it n-a. 
>> My grandfather lugio mass tro, they shortened it. 
>> There you go. It's either larry brown, lawrence brogna, or it is in on my baptism lorenzo brognia. 
>> Tradition and memories are the brick and mortar of life. They bind, providing shelter and giving gentle dimension. And while time poses our past's greatest threat, it also serves as a bearing toward our future. So we can all always find our way home. 
>> We talked very little about that. I could kick myself later on whegrew up more and i thought about it, I thought why didn't I ask them more about what is was like. 
>> I think there's always a part of us that wants to remember, that finds solace and peace in those traditions that your family observed when you were young.

>> This melon produces a large quantity of an antioxidant enzyme called s.O.D. The enzyme keeps this unique melon from decaying and in the skin, helps prevent cells from aging as fast as they normally would. 
>> What's unique with meaningful beauty is we use this very powerful super antioxidants and we are one of the first in america to use it in a skin care. 
>> I talk to a lot of people about a lot of different skin care and when I see meaningful beauty, people say "what is it about that secret melon, that antioxidant?" I think of it as the magic melon at the core of this story. 
>> Meaningful beauty is based around this special melon that is grown only in the south of france. It has this very special and very potent antioxidant. In the beginning if you put it next to a regular melon, you wouldn't see that much difference. But over time this melon doesn't decay as fast. It stays fresher and firmer longer. 
>> That's amazing. 
>> And I always joke. I'm like, "i want to be fresher and firmer." And doctor sebagh and his chemists figured out a way to extract this very special and very potent antioxidant that's been called the youth molecule. 
>> That melon extract clearly works. I've been using doctor sebagh and cindy's formulas for three years and it is amazing how great my skin looks. 
>> I actually went to my dermatologist and she said "your skin looks fantastic. What are you doing?" And I thought that it might be like candid camera. I looked around because I thought, "you're kidding me, right?" And she's like, "no, your skin tone looks better. Your pores look smaller. Everything's better." And I was like, "it's meaningful beauty." 
>> I've had the opportunity to review before and after photographs, which were taken of subjects using meaningful beauty. And what we see here is the appearance of the crow's feet are visibly diminished. We see the dramatic improvement in the redness of the cheeks, in addition to a reduction in the size of the visible pores. And finally a remarkable improvement in the appearance of these deep forehead wrinkles. ??????

Natural advantage is so effective, you'll see younger-looking skin in just one week, guaranteed. But seeing is believing. This is the half-face of a 37-year-old woman and the effects of time. Notice the wrinkles around her eyes and the lines around her mouth. Now, here is the other side of the same woman's face after 60 days' use of natural advantage.

Combined with the patented microsponge delivery system, these three ingredients are time-released in a greater concentration to your skin, so you see younger-looking skin faster. Dermatologists have prescribed these ingredients for their patients for years, but rarely have they been available together in one over-the-counter skincare system, and that's what makes natural advantage so unique and so special. 

[00:02:32]


>> I don't need to look 20, but I want to look good for my age. Natural advantage helps me to do that. I feel like I'm giving my skin the best I can. 
>> When I tell people that I'm 61, they definitely take me for ten years younger... And natural advantage is the key, it is. I love it. 
>> The first time I tried natural advantage, I was really surprised. It's like a mini-facelift, and I'm lovin' it. 
>> One of the women who has seen younger-looking skin with natural advantage is jane seymour, recently featured as one ofpeople magazine's 100 most beautiful people. Now 57 years old, jane looks younger than ever. Just look at these photos of jane taken ten years apart-- she doesn't look like she's aged a day. It's not surgery, and it's not botox-- it's natural advantage.

Now every woman can look years younger with natural advantage! 
>> Does your skin giveve away your age, or worse, make you look even older? When you see a camera, do you hide your face, or are you ready for your close-up? Well, I don't mind giving away my age. I'm 57 years old, and people ask me how I keep my skin looking its best. I've never had a facelift, and the time I tried botox, I didn't like it. I want to look natural. Of course, every woman wants younger-looking, more beautiful skin, but how do you get it? I didn't know what would really work, so I used to try everything. I tried the most-expensive products. I tried the latest skincare fads. Some smelled good, some felt good, but I never saw a real difference in my skin until I discovered natural advantage. When I saw how it helped the overall look of my skin, how it helped my skin to look younger in such a short time, I wanted to find out everything I could about it and share it with everyone I know. That's when I decided to talk to the experts and find out what you need in skincare, what really works, and why. I recently spoke with leading dermatologist dr. Gabrielle sabini about skincare and natural advantage. So, tell me about retinol, what we have in natural advantage. 

[00:05:39]


>> Retinol actually goes deep into your skin, into your dermis, which is the layer below the skin that we see, and it stimulates things that we've lost as we age. It replenishes things that we need. It doesn't just make your skin look better; it actually makes it healthier. 
>> What makes our retinol different from the others? 
>> It's the delivery system. You have a microsponge technology that delivers the retinol to exactly where we want it in a concentration that's necessary, and what natural advantage does is it works with the body's own natural renewal processes to revitalize the skin, to rebuild the things that we're losing as we age. The advantage of this product is that it doesn't cause the irritation that the prescription RETIN-A's CAUSE, AND YOU CAN Use this every day without having to take a break, without having to start every other night, as you do with the PRESCRIPTION RETIN-A's. 
>> I've seen a difference when, you know, I first started. The fine lines have gone away. If I go have a facial or something done, they're looking for some scars to see if I've had anything done, they really are, and they ask me what's my secret, and it's really no secret. It's natural advantage. 
>> When I tell people that I'm 61, they definitely take me for 10 years younger, and natural advantage is the key, it is. I love it. It really helps me to take good care of my skin, and when you wake up in the morning after using natural advantage, you see it. I feel firmer, and it just sort of gives you that kind of glow. Natural advantage is the total package. 
>> Okay, I'm a 57-year-old woman, and I'm not afraid to take off my makeup and show you exactly how I use natural advantage every day. It's just two steps in the morning and two steps at night. The first step is just to wash your face with the daily cleansing gel. It's strong enough to take off all my makeup at the end of a long day's shooting, but it's gentle on my skin. And in the morning, you apply the all-day moisture with special fruit acids and sunscreen to protect your skin. At night, you apply the nighttime renewal complex to clean the skin. Just a pea-sized amount is enough for your face and neck, and you'll wake up to younger-looking skin. It's a difference people will notice. 

[00:07:56]


>> I started noticing a difference after probably three weeks in the clarity, the brightness, and the wrinkles. People starting commenting that I looked really rested and refreshed, and I really do believe in it. 
>> So what exactly is the special delivery system that's the real secret to natural advantage? I asked dermatologist dr. Joel cohen to explain how it works. 
>> Topical formulations that are applied to the skin to improve texture and color and tone of the skin, it's important that you have adequate amount of material that's applied to the to do something, so having a delivery system that incorporates a microsponge delayed delivery system, where some amount of product is delivered, and then through that sponge and the absorption of that sponge, you get additional amount of product that is delivered over a period of time. It is much more effective for patients, and that's what this product can do. 
>> And with all the science behind natural advantage, the results are truly amazing. It's real science that gives you natural beauty. In a clinical study, within eight weeks 100% of women saw a reduction in the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles, a decrease in the appearance of pore size, and a decrease in the appearance of skin blotchiness. And we're not talking minimal results here. Uneven skin tone was improved by an incredible 70%, and the appearance of visible lines and wrinkles was decreased by 50%. That's like seeing half your wrinkles simply seem to disappear. You can be your own age, but be the best that you can be. Your skin glows and radiates a more-youthful suppleness, and you shine from within with natural confidence. You're aging naturally... And beautifully. 
>> I'm 44. 
>> I'm 61. 
>> I'm 40 years old. 
>> I'm 61 years old. 
>> I'm 71 years old. 
>> These women all look years younger than their actual age. So what's their secret? They use natural advantage-- one of the most powerful cosmeceutical anti-aging systems ever developed. So why is natural advantage so effective in making women look years younger?

Two are available only through invasive medical procedures, and one requires a doctor's prescription. And three are in natural advantage. 

[00:15:17]

>> Nerida joy is a world-renowned esthetician who's on the cutting edge of skincare. She's been treating celebrity clients at her beverly hills salon for years. Here's what she had to say about natural advantage. 
>> When I first starteusing natural advantage, day one, I felt activity, and activity is working on live cells. You know, that's-- it's, like, for a lot of people they get nervous. So, day two, I noticed pore size smaller. This is impressive. I'm impressed with this. Day three, basically texture-changing, a little brighter, brown spots a little lighter. Day seven, you're feeling firmness, but what I found through using natural advantage was that the moisture content in my skin was really good. And it feels good. It feels really healthy. It was exciting to me to find something that you feel, "wow, this is-- I'm really impressed, you know, because it works." 
>> But seeing is believing. This is the half-face of a 40-year-old woman and the effects of time. Notice the wrinkles around her eyes, the lines around her mouth. Now, here is the other side of the same woman's face after 60 days' use of natural advantage. Wrinkles around the eyes appear virtually gone, and the laugh lines have been visibly diminished-- proof positive that natural advantage really works. 

[00:17:33]


>> I've seen things come and go for 25 years, but this is what works, and there's no reason to spend more money on skincare. The value and quality of natural advantage is just amazing, and with natural advantage, you can actually see the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles, the signs of aging, and sun damage start to diminish right before your eyes. That's why I use natural advantage, and that's why you deserve your own natural advantage. 
>> Jennie finch might be seen model or a celebrity, but she's a fierce competitor as a star member of the u.S. Women's olympic softball team. Jennie spends a lot of time in the sun and traveling around the world, so natural advantage has become her best defense against the visible signs of aging. 
>> I take my time very seriously, and it takes a lot for me to be able to take a product with me on the road and have time to use it and make time to use it, but with natural advantage, I want to use it. In the morning, I want to wake up and put it on because I know that I see results from it, and that's what keeps you going back each morning and every night before you go to bed. I love natural advantage, and I love what it's done for my skin. 
>> Seymour: And when something works, you share it, so I invited a group of natural advantage users to join me for a day of beauty and skincare and to talk about natural advantage. The thing is that i-- I was asked to do a lot of different products by a lot of different companies, and a lot of them were really, really high-end, and some of them are very famous, and--i won't give you the names of them-- but, you know, the minimum price of one tube is $150-plus. And I could've gone that route, but when I tried this, this worked as well, if not better, and certainly easier. I mean, I kept wondering, "why do I have to put 20 of these products on, one on top of another?" I mean, if it's gonna work, surely it's just going to work, isn't it? And I started using this, and I didn't announce to anyone that I was using it, and straightaway people started saying to me that my skin was looking really good. And I noticed it too, of course,! But I then thought, well, you know what, this-- how cool would it be to actually use and endorse and have a product that is affordable to everyone, that actually works, that actually has real ingredients, you know, that are scientifically known to make a difference to your skin? 

[00:19:56]


>> It's a wonderful product. It does everything that you say and represent that it's going to do, and, as you say, the ingredients are proven and the price is reasonable. It's something that nearly anyone could afford. 
>> There's so many products out there, and I've tried a bunch--i'm sure everybody's tried a bunch, and this actually really, really made such an improvement in my skin, just the skin tone, the evenness and the-- the moisture quality. I love it. 
>> But I have one complaint-- I still don't look like you! 
>> ( laughing ) 
>> I want my skin to look really healthy, and I want to look young. I don't need to look 20, but I want to look good for my age. Natural advantage helps me to do that; I feel like I'm giving my skin the best I can, and I think it makes my skin look much healthier than it did before. 
>> I've never, ever bought anything from an infomeral before, and so, you know, this is my first time, and I absolutely love the product, and immediately there was a difference, and I love the way my skin feels and looks. So I'm just so happy with it, and I know everybody that uses it is gonna have the same results that I've seen. 
>> Natural advantage has made me feel as young on the outside as I do on the inside, and I've wanted that my entire life. 
>> I've been an actress now for-- oh, my god-- 40 years, and it's just been incredibly important to me to always look natural, to look like me, while a lot of other actresses are choosing to do all kinds of things to their faces and, you know, I keep looking and I keep thinking, "should i? Should i?" And I just realize that I don't want to do that. I want to look natural. I want to look as good as I possibly can, and I want to look like me, and natural advantage has enabled me to do that. It's made my skin amazing, and people never believe my age when I tell them. 
>> I'm 44. 
>> I'm 61. 
>> I'm 40 years old. 

[00:21:57]


>> I'm 61 years old. 
>> I'm 71 years old.

>> Woodruff: Resistance from house republicans delayed action on a fiscal cliff compromise passed overwhelmingly by the senate in the wee hours of this new year's day. Good evening. I'm judy woodruff. 
>> Suarez: And I'm ray suarez. On the newshour tonight, we get the latest on the stalemate plus we hear from republican tom cole of oklahoma and democrat chris van hollen of maryland. 
>> Woodruff: Jeffrey brown has an update on some of the areas hit hardest by superstorm sandy, where recovery continues at a slow pace. 
>> Suarez: We talk with journalist and author claudia kolker about her research into the "immigrant advantage." It's still without electricity, gas, sewers or water. And we continue our conversations with new members of the 113th congress. Tonight the senator-elect from nebraska, republican deb fischer. 
>> Woodruff: That's all ahead on tonight's newshour. 
>> Major funding for the pbs newshour has been provided by moving our economy for 160 years. Bnsf, the engine that connects us. 
>> And by the bill and melinda gates foundation. Dedicated to the idea that all people deserve the chance to le a healthy, productive life. 
>> And with the ongoing support of these institutions and foundations. And... 

[00:02:08]


>> This program was made possible by the corporation for public broadcasting. And by contributions to your pbs station from viewers like you. Thank you. 
>> Woodruff: This turned out to be a long day of waiting for final action on the "fiscal cliff" bill that cleared the senate early today. In the house, the measure ran into republican demands for more spending cuts, and its prospects for passage there dimmed. Congress began the new year having missed its deadline to keep tax cuts from rising back to 1990's levels for most americans. And to prevent across-the-board spending cuts. Instead, house republicans and democrats spent much of the day mulling a bill that cleared the senate shortly before 2:00 a.m. 
>> The yeah's are 89. THE NAYs ARE 8. 60-vote threshold having been achieved the bill as amended is passed. 
>> Woodruff: The senate bill makes permanent the bush era tax cuts for 99% of families, those with incomes under $450,000 a year. Anything over that amount would be taxed at a rate of 39.6%, up from the current 35. The agreement would raise the estate tax on large estates to 40%. But the payroll tax cut of the last two years would expire. The bill also extends unemployment benefits for a year and it stops a cut in medicare payments for physicians. The senate vote was a rare show of unity welcomed by leaders of both parties. 
>> As I said, this shouldn't be the model for how we do things around here. But I think we can say we've done some good for the country. 
>> In passing this agreement does not mean negotiations halt. Far from it. We can all agree there's more work to be done. 
>> Woodruff: President obama sounded a similar note in a statement saying, while neither democrats nor republicans got everything they wanted, this agreement is the right thing to do for our country and the house should pass it without delay. The president and house speaker john boehner had once talked of a grand bargain with $4 trillion in deficit reduction. Instead, the congressional budget office calculated today that extending the bush era tax cuts for 99% of americans would add $4 trillion to the deficit over the next decade. The senate measure delays mandatory pentagon and domestic spending cuts by two months. As the house convened at midday, a number of republican congressmen complained the bill is still too heavy on tax hikes and too light on spending cuts. Ohio's steve la tourette dismissed it as a, quote, package put together by a bunch of sleep-deprived october octogenenarians on new year's eve and the alabama representative said the house needs more time. 

[00:05:07]


>> The house must postpone this vote until congress and the american people have time to study and evaluate this extraordinarily complex legislation and its impact on taxes, revenue, the economy, our debt and a myriad of other issues. 
>> Woodruff: Tennessee democrat steve cohen warned about the consequences of not taking the senate deal. 
>> My district can't afford to wait a few days and have the stock market go down 300 points tomorrow if we don't ghettoing and do something. 
>> Woodruff: Later house democratic leaders emerged from a nearly three-hour meeting with vice president biden who helped broker the senate deal. Minority leader nancy pelosi called for action. 
>> We look forward now as we go forward in this day to see what the timing will be for a straight up-or-down vote on what passed 89-8 last night in the united states senate. 
>> Woodruff: House republicans also met and gave no sign they were ready to call a vote on the senate bill. Instead majority leader eric cantor said he won't support the measure. And others left open the possibility of changing the bill. And sending it back to the senate. So how will the twists and turns play out? We turn to newshour regular todd zwillich. He's washington correspondent for "the takeaway" on public radio international, and was there for the senate vote until nearly dawn today. Todd, you've probably slept at the capital last night. Most of the republicans in the senate voted for this bill. What is the problem that the house republicans have with it? 
>> Well, the house is a fundamentally different place than the senate, judy. Remember, this is not the first time we've seen this dynamic. Back in february there was the debate over that very payroll tax holiday that is expiring... That has expired frankly at midnight. You got 89 or 90 votes in the senate for that. That deal fell apart in the house. The highway bill got 74 bipartisan votes in the senate. That fell apart. They're two different places. There had been tacit assurances or at least pronouncements from the house republican leadership after speaker boehner's plan-b fell apart last week, that the senate had to act and that that was the only way forward. There's some frustration, as you can imagine, on the house side now that the senate did act and acted with 89 affirmative votes for the tough deal that leader McCONNELL AND VICE PRESIDENT Biden struck. Only to have a rebellion in the house republican conference. Now that conference is in discussions right now, as we speak. They went into a meeting about 45 minutes ago. They haven't emerged yet to try to find a way forward. As for amending the bill which so many house conservatives say they are demanding right now, the senate has made clear, senate democratic aides have made clear they're done. If the house amends that bill they will not touch it. They'll relitigate this somehow in the new congress. 

[00:08:00]


>> Woodruff: Is it the case that most republicans in the house are against this? Are you able to get a read on how widespread the opposition is? 
>> It is the case that most house republicans are against it. That doesn't mean that all would vote against it. The dynamic you have here now is fairly broad support from democrats in the house. Leader nancy pelosi and other democratic leaders calling for an up-or-down vote on th senate-passed bill. That tells you something. That tells you that if speaker boehner and leader cannottor put it on the floor and can muster enough votes, 40 or 50 which doesn't look great for them, that democrats will provide the rest of the power to get it to 217. 
>> Woodruff: But it sounds like from the speaker has been saying he doesn't want to do that. He doesn't want to see the bill pass with a minority of republican votes. Is that correct? 
>> He has said that in the past. And one thing that we will see during the remainder of this night and probably into tomorrow is whether that calculus sticks or whether he ultimately decides to put the bill on the floor and pass it with nancy pelosi's votes. That may be his only way out of at this point. He does have another option. Which is to do nothing or vote the bill down and let the 113th congress fight this out. Democrats are already walking around the hill, jy, making it clear that the entire deal is off. Of course, constitutionally the bill has to be rewritten after thursday. Afternoon on thursday. But the deal is off. The tax rates will be different. Everything will be different at that point. 
>> Woodruff: Todd, why aren't republicans more concerned about what we heard just now from a democratic member of congress from tennessee? And that is what the stock market reaction is going to be. How the economy is going to react if this agreement is not reached tonight? 
>> Well, they may be concerned about it. I don't think it's fair to say that they're not concerned about it at all. Many people have memories of the tarp debate from a couple of years ago. Keep in mind house republicans voted down that emergency deal too. Only to see the market tank, as I recall, 777 points and then come back and pass the deal. A lot of people remember that. The republican whip kevin McCARTHY, HOWEVER, WALKING Into this meeting when he was asked by reporters what about the thursday noon deadline which is constitutionally the end of this congress, he said it's not thursday at noon yet. 

[00:10:16]


>> Woodruff: We also know, todd, just quickly that the speaker is up for election as speaker again shortly. How much of a role is that playing now that we see the republican leader in the house, eric cantor, openly apparently saying he's against this bill? 
>> And clearly this is a big part of the trouble here. It is always a challenge, it's always a risk for any speaker to pass any bill, but a high-profile bill with the country watching, the large part of the economy at stake without a majority of his own members and conservatives are perennialally up in arms about spending and deficits. That's a big part of this. I will note that going into this republican conference meeting that just started 45 minutes ago, judy, eric cantor and john boehner literally walked in shoulder to shoulder. I mean their shoulders touching in an optical show of unity. 
>> Woodruff: Just quickly, todd, finally, I'm going to ask you the same thing I ended with last night. What are you watching for in the next few hours? 
>> You're really watching for house republicans at this point. Democrats have made clear that they will help pass the senate compromise with mitch McCONNELL AND JOE BIDEN. You're looking for a critical mass of republicans who can push it through. You're looking to see whether republicans will drop this demand that they will only support an amended bill. Senate democrats says that means the death of this deal. You're watching to see if they back down and how much support john behner is willing to use to put the deal on the floor. 
>> Woodruff: Ed todd zwillich, we'll see whether you get much sleep tonight. Thank you. 
>> No problem, judy. 
>> Suarez: Now, our second look at this continually unfolding story, with little time left before the 112th congress ends thursday at noon. For that, we are joined by congressmen from both sides. Representative tom cole is a republican from oklahoma. Representative chris van hollen of maryland is the ranking member on the budget committee and part of the democratic leadership team. Representative cole, let me start with you, since you've just come from a powe wow with your side of the aisle. What's the latest? Is a vote imminent? Has there been any shift from an earlier stated determination to amend the current bill? 

[00:12:21]


>> Well, I think there's discussion on the way. That meeting is still going on. So I stepped out early and i wouldn't presume to comment on any final decisions. But, look, at the end of the day, we're doing what you ought to do. We have a product literally at 2:00 in the morning last night. We're looking over, deciding the appropriate way to proceed. I think we'll reach that decision tonight. We're looking for consensus among ourembership as to what to do, not necessarily how to vote. Then we'll go from there. But I would expect that we'll see action obviously if not tonight, tomorrow. 
>> Suarez: It is significant, isn't it, sir, that your leader, representative cantor, has said he doesn't want to vote for the bill in its current form. 
>> I don't think any republican wants to vote for it. I'm sure a lot of democrats don't want to vote for it. The real question is, will you vote for it if that's the only alternative that make sure that taxes won't go up for 98% of the american people? We literally have 3.6 trillion dollars worth of tax relief that can be cemented for a long time. It can be done in a bipartisan fashion. We're going to have plenty of differences with our friends on the other side of the rotunda and the other side of the aisle when it comes to spending january, february, and march. To me the wise thing to do is to, you know, pocket, you know, what you can out of this arrangement, protect the american people, move on to the other areas of disagreement. Maybe we can even find some compromise. 
>> Suarez: Representative van hollen, let me turn to you. In this sort of situation, the clock is running. The congress is coming to its final hours. What does a minority party do in a situation like this? Can you keep all your members poised and ready to go until such time as the majority is ready to call the motion? 
>> Well, yes, we can. Ray, what we have here is a very alarming situation. You had a bipartisan compromise vote in the united states senate. 89 out of 100 senators, republicans and democrats together for the good of the country and to avoid the fiscal cliff, passing this agreement. Now you have the situation in the house rt now where we the democrats have asked for an up-or-down vote on that bipartisan compromise bill and so far the wordwe're getting is we're not going to have that opportunity. That is a clear signal that republicans in the house are taking us right over the fiscal cliff. I wished the entire republican caucus was as reasonable as the colleague of mine and friend who is standing right next to me who is a very conservative republican but a very practical common sense rpublican. If his colleagues would listen to him, we would be in decent shape here. Right now the problem in the republican caucus and the house is compromise has bng a dirty word. As you ind things in this bill that I don't like. There are things in this bill that I don't like. But I recognize that none of us get to have things 100% of our way. And the difference between divided government and dysfunctional government is a willingness to compromise. And compromise is in very short supply today in the house republican caucus. 

[00:15:27]


>> Suarez: Representative van hollen you heard your colleague tom cole talk about deep misgivings inside the republican caucus. Aren't there members of your party who are not overjoyed with what came out of the senate last night? Where the dividing lines among democrats in the house today? 
>> Yes, there are. Our members have very serious questions about this particular agreement. The vice president appeared before the democratic caucus in the house for about three hours. He took a lot of questions. He addressed a lot of people's concerns. But people still have very serious concerns. But democrats in the house also recognize that we are now past midnight on january 1. We're headed over the fiscal cliff. And for the good of the country we have to compromise. That doesn't mean every democrat is going to support this measure. But I think you're finding a much greater sense of willingness to compromise for the good of the country among democrats than obviously you're seeing among house republicans at this moment. It is very alarming that we're at this particular juncture. 
>> Suarez: Representative cole, let's pitch forward a bit. Just a short time ago the associated press quoted aides to senior leadership in the senate saying that there's no time left for a vote. If the house amends this bill and sends it back to them, it simply is not going to be taken up during the 112th congress. Have you run out the clock? No matter what your members do? 
>> No, I don't think we have run out the clock. Look, we're having the same type of discussions and debates within our ranks that my friend chris and his colleagues are having earlier today as well. I would not prejudge where the republican conference is going to be. I remain, as I have been all through this, optimistic that at the end of the day we're going to arrive at an acceptable deal that takes care of the fiscal cliff and certainly sells the tax issue. I do think we're moving to some really big spending fights early next year. I'm pretty comfortable with where we are tonight in terms of getting a deal. It is a compromise deal that, again, will have members on both sides that don't support but we'll have members on both sides that do. 

[00:17:38]


>> Suarez: So the senate has adjourned. ' The bill is amended and sent back to them (talking over each OTHER) WITH THE 113th. 
>> I'm hoping what we're hearing here from my friend tom is maybe a little hint that it will not be amended after all, which would be a very good sign because if this bill is amended, it will violate an agreement that had strong bipartisan support in the senate. It would mean that we're going over the fiscal cliff. If the latest is that maybe they won't be amending it, that would be a very positive sign. 
>> Suarez: Let me ask you both, if there's interest on both sides of the aisle to not start this argument all over again with the 113th congress. With new members in both chambers, with different interests at play. Is there an interest on both your parties' parts to make sure that doesn't happen? Mr. Cole? 
>> I don't intend to speak for my party but I think your point is a valid one. I think it's incumbent upon this congress to solve this problem: I think it would be extraordinarily unfair to new members to show up and have this tax issue dumped in their laps. We're very, very close to a bipartisan solution. Again, nobody is happy with everything in the bill on either side. But I think pushing it forward would not be... We're going to have pretty good fights next year. We don't need to create another one. We ought to settle this one between now and the end of the 112th congress. 
>> Suarez: Representative van hollen if there's a split in the republican party, do you think there's another solid whipping on your side of the aisle that you'll help your republican colleagues get this over the finish line before the clock runs out on this congress some. 
>> Ray, I don't have a particular vote count on the democratic side. What I do know is that democrats in the house recognize that compromise is important for the good of the country. We don't have an extremist caucus that believes that you always get to have everything 100% your way as some members of the house republican caucus seem to believe. Based on that, I believe that you'll have a strong bipartisan contribution from democrats. Again, that depends on us having an up-or-down vote on this bill that passed the senate with 9 out of 100 votes. I am worried, to your question, ray, that even once we get beyond this -- and I hope we will -- and avoid going over the fiscal cliff, that we're going to be in the same kind of situation with respect to the debt ceiling and making sure that the united states government makes good on the full faith and credit. We can't be a country that does not pay its bills, that we don't meet the obligations that we've already incurred. You already hear many republicans threatening the united states would default on its debt which would frankly make the fiscal cliff situation look like a picnic in comparison with respect to what would happen to the economy. 

[00:20:37]


Suarez: Representative cole, before I let you both go, your caucus meeting is just breaking up now. Was there discussion of an up-and-down vote as part of that meeting? 
>> Certainly was. There was discussion of all ranges of options in front of us. I think I sense a consensus developing. I'm pretty optimistic about what the next 48 hours will bring. But again let's wait and see. 
>> Suarez: Representative tom cole of oklahoma. Representative chris van hollen of maryland. Very tense time in the country's life. Gentlemen, thanks for joining us. 
>> Thank you. . 
>> Woodruff: Still to come on the newshour, recovery efforts post-hurricane sandy; the paradoxes of immigration; and senator-elect deb fischer of nebraska. But first, the other news of the day. Here's kwame holman. 
>> Holman: This first day of 2013 brought the traditional sights and scenes of the new year, around the country today. In pasadena, california, the 124th rose parade kicked off this morning. 42 floats made the five-mile journey along with 23 marching bands. An estimated 700,000 people lined the streets to watch. And in new york city, it was an early morning start for sanitation workers. Crews worked to collect tons of garbage, including the remnants of some 17 million pieces of confetti that fell on times square at midnight. New year's celebrations turned deadly overnight in ivory coast, when a crowd stampeded. More than 60 people died in the crush to leave a stadium after a fireworks show in abidjan, the country's major commercial city. Most of the victims were children and teenagers. Some 200 others were injured. Today the president of the west african nation callefor efforts to improve public safety. It's a national tragedy, of course. And I really hope that we will push ourselves to investigate, to see what could have prevented this tragedy so that it will not happen again. 
>> The government also pledged to cover the cost of hospital treatment for the injured. A new wave of violence rocked pakistan today leaving nine dead and dozens wounded. In the northwest, gunmen a in the northwest, gunmen ambushed a van in the town of swabi, killing five female teachers and two aid workers. It followed a series of militant attacks targeting anti-polio workers. To the south, a bomb exploded near a large political rally in karachi. At least four people died there, and dozens were hurt. The number of civilian deaths in iraq rose in 2012 for the first time in three years. The human rights group iraq body count reported today there were 4,471 civilians killed, up more than 400 from the year before. The group said it shows iraq remains in a state of "low-level war" with insurgents. The state of pennsylvania will sue the n.C.A.A. Over sanctions against penn state university in the child sexual abuse scandal that rocked the school. The penalties include a $60 million fine to finance child abuse prevention grants nationwide. Governor tom corbett said today the state wants a federal court to guarantee that all of the money is spent in pennsylvania. The university agreed to the sanctions last july. Those are some of the day's major stories. Now, back to judy. 

[00:23:52]


>> Woodruff: Now we return to one of the biggest stories of last year, hurricane sandy, and its devastating impact on new york and new jersey. Jeffrey brown has our update on where things stand today. 
>> Brown: As winter storms bore down on parts of the midwest and northeast last week, flood waters again rose in a small coastal town of sea bright new jersey. 
>> We went through the previous storm. It was bad. Ididn't expect another one that quickly. 
>> We went through a very strong last night. Plus we're more vulnerable because we don't have any sand on the beach. 
>> Brown: Those sands were washed away two months ago when hurricane sandy battered new jersey, new york and connecticut killing at least 125 people in the u.S. And causing a minimum of $62 billion in damage. Left behind are daily reminders of the storm's impact. Just an hour from sea bright, another small town was badly damaged by sandy. Of the community's 520 homes, 60 were washed away and 139 remain uninhabitable. Still without electricity, gas, sewers or water. 
>> We're the smallest town with the most amount of damage. We have to ache it one step at a time. We can't expect anything to happen overnight. It's baby steps. 
>> Brown: On new york's statten island some of those who lost their homes spent christmas in shelters. 
>> This is actually the first time ever since 1916 there won't be a member of my family in my home on christmas morning. 
>> Brown: Meanwhile others have left new york for temporary homes in places like new milford connecticut. 
>> Right now I'm just taking it all in, just to even have my own little personal space is such a luxury. You change your goals. You change your priorities, your basic... Everything changes. 
>> Brown: Yet some areas are showing signs of life again. In recent weeks businesses in seaside heights, new jersey, have been reopening to very grateful customers. 

[00:25:55]


>> This is very good. I was hoping this one and the pizza place down the street, hoping it would be there too but not wayne gretzky. 
>> Refreshing, happy to be here. We're trying to serve the people of our community. Just resort to business as usual in a very uncomfortable circumstance. ?????? It's my life ???????????? 
>> Brown: To help victims across the region, there have been on going relief efforts like this concert in madison square garden on december 12. And mayor michael bloomberg has pledged to rebuild new york's devastated coastal areas. 
>> Let me be clear. We are not going to abandon the waterfront. We're not going to leave the rock-aways or coney island or statten island south shore. We can't just rebuild what was there and hope for the best. We have to build smarter and stronger and more sustainably. 
>> To do so so the governors of new york, new jersey and connecticut have asked for 82 billion dollars in federal disaster relief aid. 
>> We get a further update from two reporters covering the post sandy situation. A reporter from the "new york times" and mike schneider managing editor and anchor of new jersey today on public television. Sarah, start with the areas you've been looking at. What major problems persist weeks after the storm? 
>> Well, it depends where you look. In new jersey, some towns are still on lockdown. So they're really at a standstill. People have been able to maybe cart out dry wall, clean up the mold, but they can't progress. They can't figure out if they want to raise up their houses, or just build it the way it was. Really prevented from moving forward at all. When you go to places like the rock-aways, while there's been tremendous clean-up, again these same issues. People don't know, are they going to get insurance money to fix the way they need to? Are they going to get extra subsidies in order to do these mitigating factors? So the problems that persist are how to rebuild and when. 
>> Brown: Mike snyder, how would you characterize it? Is it really different in different areas? 

[00:27:59]


>> Very much so. It depends on what part of the coast you're on, it depends on whether you're on the coast or inland right now. There's a growing sense in the state of new jersey that people are starting to get to the point where the storm is passed, the recovery has been promised. Now where is my check? When can I go back home? There are thousands of people in this state who still can't go home. Many of them now are starting to raise questions about how come the fema process which was promised to be so smooth hasn't turned out that way. They've addressd these issues directly to governor and some municipals are asking about why things hadn't worked out as well as they had hoped. If you cover disasters this is not unusual. But what is unusual right now is that here we are this far out and still no promise of that congressional aid which has been supposedly in the works for a ile coming to help make things better, a little more quickly, and to raise people's hopes as well. 
>> Brown: Mike, tell us a little bit more about that aid process, whether it's government, whether it's fema, whether it's insurance coverage and claims. You're saying that it's not running as smoothly as people had hoped? 
>> Well, if you talk to a lot of the insurance companies here, they will tell you that they've handled a record number of claims for a record amounts of money in record time. The statistics tend to bear that out. But that can't take care of all people in all places at all time. If your neighbors back home that's fine and dandy for your neighbor. If you're not back home that still doesn't make things quite so nice for you. The fema process, we've talked to people from fema on the set here. They have been very, very aggressionive about wanting to get out there in the field and take care of things but governor christie held a town meeting just a few days ago in which for the first time, and the governor has had a remarkable relationship with the people of his state ever since this storm hit. He was out on the field. The pictures have become part of the legend of chris christie in this state about his empathy and sympathy for those arnold him. What we're start to go see now in town meetings that se people are standing up and saying we expected this to work out this way. We had these numbers we were supposed to call. Suddenly you know what? We're getting the run-around because fema says we can't do it way. We have to talk to somebody he will. Our insurance companies say no you have to talk to fema. There are some people out there who are just a little and with some justification we might add if you're out of your home as long as they have been, they're getting a little bit frustrated. 

[00:30:23]


>> Brown: Pick up on that. Did you hear similar such things? Is there even a neighborhood or even a building that kind of crystallizes the situation for you? 
>> I've actually been covering pretty extensively one housing complex called ocean village in the rock-aways. When we think of the storm we think of it hitting people in the flood waters' path. People on the ground. Actually people were stuck on the 19th floor of this housing complex in the dark, no running water, no working toilets. No way to get up and down especially if they we elderly. I've been watching this place rebuild. They're still on generator power. Their transformer deluged with sea water won't be up any time soon. It's really em bullet at I can of a lot of places out there. There are people sitting right now with no heat. There are scores of people or thousands of scores of people without electricity still. As we were just saying, if one place is illuminated and cozy and warm the building next to it can be ice cold and completely powerless. That still persists. 
>> Brown: Mike, going back to what both of you talked about. Many people still trying to make this decision about whether to rebuild, how to do it. I mean we're even seeing recent, younow, the vulnerability is there even we see in recent storms. That must complicate these decisions even more. 
>> Absolutely. It does. It raises that whole sense of vulnerability once again. People in this part of the country for a long time heard about bad storms, watched bad storms, simple thesed with the people who were being victimized. Now they are the victims. It's an entirely different sort of situation. Right now you have this growing nagging question about what do we do to rebuild? Governor christie has said the shore is coming back. It won't be the same as it was in our mind's eye but it's coming back. But I've spoken to orm former governor whitman and others as well. They're starting to say you know what? We need to rebuild but we need to rebuild smart. Do we want to go back and try to replicate what was there in our mind's eye? Is that something we're capable of doing? Even if we were, is that something that's advisable to do? We've heard all the climatology reports about what is coming our way. Can we afford to go back and put that kind of money to rebuild that kind of infrastructure in an area that many say is likely to suffer the same fate time and time again in the not-too-distant future? 

[00:32:43]


>> You know, sarah, that's something that we've heard from mayor bloomberg as well. We're going to rebuildut we're going to try to rebuild smart. I'm just wondering at ground level when you're covering this, do you hear much about that kind of long-term discussion or is it too early for that? 
>> Well, look, being able to rebuild smart is a luxury. You have to have the money to do that. And there are people who are admitted into these communities who probably inherited a house from a grandma or great grandma. They do not have the luxury to rebuild smart. They can barely rebuild at all. I met a woman whose house is what's called red tagged. It's coming down. She has no flood insurance or homeowners' insurance. The mortgage has been paid off for forever. She's in breezy point which was a very hard hit community. 110 or more houses burnt down during the but others are knocked off their foundation. She can't rebuild smart. Even with the money that she's going to get from fema for mitigation to prop it up a little or put in a break-away wall so when the water comes through again as it inevitably will, she doesn't have that luxury. She good going to rebuild again and cross her fingers that this was the storm of the century. 
>> Brown: In our closing minutes here, let me ask you both about, I'll start with you, mike, about what we heard when all this happened that, you know, it showed some of the divisions, some of the class divisions in the area but it also brought people together in some unusual ways. These couple months later, where do you think things... Where do things stand? 
>> New jersey right now is still a rather tightly knit state on this issue. You know, one of the things that came up during some of these benefit concerts, springsteen has talked about it, the governor has talked about it as well, is that the shore has all these unique places there are places on the jersey shore where rich people have lived and will continue to liske. There are places down the jersey shore where the truck driver, where the garbage collector, where the school teacher, where all sorts of people of all sorts of different socioeconomic levels have lived for decades now. And that's the big question. That's the kernel of doubt that is starting to creep into this to the extent that it does exist is whether or not we know the rich areas probably will be able to sustain themselves because they have the money to do so. But for these other folks who are waiting for insurance checks, who are hoping to be able to put together the dollars and cents that they have in their savings accounts or investments, to be ale to put this back on the face of the earth the way it was or at least the way they would like it to be, can they afford to do it? That's a big question. And the commitment of this state to see that through will probably tell us a lot about who we are as a state. 

[00:35:19]


>> Brown: Sarah, last word from you. 
>> Right after the storm, there was this incredible onslaught of people from all over new york city and elsewhere into these what are essentially very impoverished areas that happen to coincide with where the storm hit hardest. There was a group of people hipsters who were helping, they called them help alreadysters because they had transformed into this squad of skinny jeans helpful people. Haven't seen them very much. In the numbers that I saw in the very beginning. It sort of lost its trendiness. It's not on the forefront of people's minds. Another way that divisions are going to reinsert themselves again is that with people getting out of their houses the real estate market is incredibly depressed in many water side areas where people don'tknow what the future is going to be of these places so people are selling their houses to the first taker. And you have what can be sort of predatory purchases. That's going to change the demographics of these areas because you have working class areas that can't afford to rebuild and the people with money are going to be able to come in and purchase these homes and really change can the socioeconomic landscape of what were working class store front homes. 
>> Brown: Thank you both very much. Leaders in business and politics are increasing looking to community colleges to help train students and in some cases even connect them directly with potential employers. Special correspondent john palenko of learning matters has a story about the unusual path one college in washington state is taking. 
>> Reporter: The 2012 seattle wine awards. Showcasing the best in washington state wines. 
>> We have over 700 wineries. We make some of the best cabernet and merrill owe. We're one of the top places in the world for making fine wines. 

[00:37:27]


>> Reporter: One champion receiving three double gold medals was an entry few had ever heard of. College cellars. 
>> It's very full bodied and very chocolaty. I like it. 
>> Reporter: Made by students learning wine making at their local community college. 
>> We entered six wines. We went six for six. 
>> Reporter: Wine instructor tim donahue. 
>> That was a goal from day one. I wanted to teach them how to make day one. We got the medals. It was like wow we did it. It happened. 
>> Reporter: The wine was made here 270 miles southeast of seattle in walla walla, washington. Best known for its fertile farmlands, sweet onions and apples it was here 12 years ago that the community college launched its wine school the first of its kind in the nation. 
>> You always want a bottle ready to go. If you don't you can drip a little bit. 
>> Reporter: The two-year degree program covers everything from grape growing and pressing to barreling, blending and tasting, taught hands-on at the college's vineyard. 
>> It's hard, hard work. A lot of people think it's sitting in the vine sipping wine. It's not. You're cold. You're wet. You're in a cellar. You're lifting heavy things. There's definitely a solid blue collar job. 
>> I was impressed with how much they're able to cram into two years. 
>> Reporter: The program attracts students from across the country. Many of whom like tyler tennyson comes to wine making from other careers. 
>> I was a commercial prayer. I got laid off. So I called my wife and I said i have good news and I have bad news. The bad news is I got laid off. The good news is we can move to walla walla. Six weerks later I was starting the program and doing a harvest. 
>> Reporter: After graduating tyler was hired as a cellar master, overseeing all aspects of production at seven hills vintners a premiere wine maker the walla walla. 
>> I felt totally competent to step into a winery and play an active role in wine making. 

[00:39:30]


>> Reporter: A recent survey of graduates found 80% are working in the wine industry. As vineyard managers, wine makers, cellar workers and wine sellers. Most earn between $25,000 and $55,000 a year. As much as this is a story about wine making it's also a story about walla walla, a small town like many others that was hit hard. And what happened when the community college decided to play a part in helping to turn things around. Before making wine, walla walla was famous for wheat and other crops that brought prosperity to the valley for more than 100 years. BUT IN THE 1990s, FREE TRADE Agreements flooded the market with cheap imported produce. 
>> We started losing our food processing industry which provided hundreds of jobs for people. 
>> Reporter: Steven van ausdale is the college president. 
>> Quality of life finished. We saw more store fronts that were vacant. Companies basically went out of business and closed. 
>> Reporter: Bad as things were, they were about to get better. Sensing potential in the soil and climate here, a small group of pioneering wine makers had started growing grapes. 
>> Here at the college in our planning, we thought, gee, is there something we can do maybe to hell what could be an emerging industry and opportunity. 
>> Reporter: Their answer: The wine school. To supply the trained force the industry needed to grow. 
>> The industry was the one that dictated the curriculum. It helped us design the building. 
>> This the cabernet. 
Reporter: Miles anderson, who founded one of the region's first vineyards while teaching psychology at the college, was tapped to run the program. 
>> They said we want a practical concrete hands-on so that's what we've done. 
>> Reporter: Over the next 12 years, wineries in the valley took off growing from the total of 19 to 174. A town that had been in decline saw its fortunes reversed. 

[00:41:40]


>> We have 29 tasting rooms downtown. We have great restaurants again. We have great places for people to visit. So it's flourishing. 
>> Reporter: A wine tourist spends about two-and-a-half times as much at their destination as the average tourist. So attracting tourists and keeping them here became an objective. 
>> Reporter: Along with wine making the course offerings include programs in culinary art and golf course management. Is that the proper role of a community college, to foster a hospitality business? 
>> For students, their primary interest in life is preparing for work, having a secure job. So it's all about jobs. And quality of life and standard of living and wages today, i think. 
>> Reporter: But some are hungry for more. Jody middleton already had a job at a juice processing plant. So the jeremy petty. Born and raised in walla walla, they had been friends for years. 
>> We met in middle school, played football together side by side on the offensive line. We protected our quarterback and we're working together again. 
>> Reporter: Dreaming of vin... Vineyard of their own, they enrolled in wine school and took hands-on-learning to other levels. 
>> What have we got here. 
Reporter: First they drew a vineyard. Then? 
>> All this, you guys built. From the ground up. 
Reporter: They planted their vineyard in an empty field beside jeremy's house. While it was taking root, they gave themselves another challenge. 
>> We said let's just make some wine. How are you going to understand better than actually doing it? 
>> They said, well, yo- know, what if fe want to make wine at home? 
>> There's a secret in the wine industry. I might get in trouble for letting this out. Every year there's always fruit hanging around somewhere. It's not good. It's stuff that got rejected because it's moldy or wrong. But if it's your first time making wine you're going to screw it up anyway. Do at you can. 

[00:43:47]


>> We drove out to the vineyard in the semi. I had my kids and his kids and all the family and we all pick everything. 
>> The next thing you know, they found used barrels and they found little things here and there. They just went for it. 
>> Their investment if you're in the wine industry, is unheard of, how small it is. They made pretty good wine. 
>> A little bit of... We're going to have about 300 cases from our first vintage. We'll be bottle here shortly. 
>> Reporter: The harvest from their backyard vineyard will yield another 85 cases. Then they'll start selling. 
>> Does the wine have a name? We're going with j and j vintners. Jeremy and jody. 
>> The dream is to have a successful winery, build a business that will sustain our families. Thait would be great. To be our own bosses. To be able to have something, a legacy to pass down to our children. 
>> Reporter: If j and j vintners succeed, they'll add to a growing list of wineries that colleges launched. 
>> We have 25 that have graduated with degrees and have their own wineries here in walla walla. 
>> Reporter: The college bves tomorrow's opportunities lie close to walla walla's roots, training water resource managers to protect streams that feed the vineyards and above them technicians for some 5,000 wind turbines that power the area. 
>> They're still installing them. Every 8 to 10 turbines requires a technician. The mission is for economic, environmental and cultural sustainability here. 
>> What we've done here is we've done creative risk taking. At times we were going places that no one knew where we were going. And so I call that leadership. Leadership is going places that you've never gone before. And taking people with you. 
>> Reporter: For j and j vintners, the journey starts this fall. They launch with plans to sell their first 400 cases. 

[00:45:56]


>> Woodruff: Finally tonight, we continue our conversations with newly elected members of the senate. So far, we've talked with arizona republican jeff flake, democrats heidi heitkamp from north dakota and virginia's tim kaine, and independent angus king of maine. Deb fischer will be one of just a handful of cattle ranchers in congress when she is sworn in tomorrow. The 61-year-old republican was a state senator from sparsely populated northern nebraska. She won her party nomination in a surprise victory over other, better known candidates last summer. In november, she defeated former democratic senator bob kerrey by a wide margin, and replaces retiring democrat ben nelson. Deb fischer, welcome and congratulations. 
>> Thank you, judy. Great to be here. 
>> Woodruff: Given the spectacle we're watching in the congress right now and the last few years and the low regard we know the american hold of congress, are you sure you want this job? 
>> Oh, yes. There is so much that we need to do. We just need to roll up our shreves and get to work. In nebraska we're very fortunate. We have a nonpartisan uni camral. We have experience with working with republicans and democrats. We've been able to get a lot done in nebraska. I hope I can bring that here to washington as well. 
>> Woodruff: You obviously have not been a part of the senate that has been voting the last few days but if you were sitting in the senate right now, would you have voted for the version of the fiscal cliff deal that the senate voted on last night? 
>> I haven't been part of those discussions. Like most americans, I find it very, very frustrating to watch it. It's not what we expected. I can tell you that. The spending is a problem. When I campaigned last year-and-a-half all across the state of nebraska, what I heard from people was teir concern about spending. That's not addressed in this bill. I thank the leader. I thank the vice president for coming together and putting forth part of the solution. In helping with tax relief for many americans. But that didn't go far enough. We have to address spending if we're really going to talk about the problem. 

[00:48:05]


>> Woodruff: Spending was a part of the discussion but the republicans were not able to agree with the spending cuts that were offered by the white house. Where did everything go wrong in our opinion? 
>> I think you can also say the white house didn't agree with the spending cuts that were offered by the republicans. Again we need to work together. We have to quit saying it's the republicans' fault or it's the white house's fault. Let's get past the politics on this and really look at what the solutions can be. We have to address entitlements. Everybody knows that. Americans aren't being hood winged by any of this discussion. Like I said it's frustrating. It's disappointing. It doesn't help to keep putting it off. 
>> Woodruff: Do you think tax increases in any form have a role in balancing the budget, in eventually balancing the budget and in addressing the deficit? 
>> I don't support tax increases. I campaigned saying I don't support tax increases. I don't want to see added burdens on people who create jobs. I think that's the wrong way to go about this. As you said in my introduction, I did defeat bob kerrey by a very wide margin. I did that because nebraskaians elected me knowing I don't support tax increases. 
>> Woodruff: I asked you because in this deal that's coming out of of or came out of the senate that is house is now cover considering 99% of americans will keep their tax cuts. Less than 1%, people earning over $450,000 a year, you're saying that is still unacceptable? 
>> Of course we have to provide those tax cuts to the 99%. But we're playing politics by doing it. We're saying, okay, we're going to provide tax cuts for these people but the rest they have to pay more. We don't need to create more division in this country. I mean just look at washington. I'm on the outside right now until thursday. Look at washington. It is so polarized. And talk like that just makes it worse. 

[00:50:07]


>> Woodruff: The argument that there should be a balanced approach, that there should be spending cuts but there also needs to be tax increases your answer is? 
>> My answer is we need to look at spending cults. We need to look at entitlements. We need to look at regulations. We need to look at a tax code that's broken. That both sides agree is bro but that hasn't been part of this discussion either. 
>> Woodruff: Again spending only is what you're saying? 
>> I'm saying that we need to cut the spending and every american knows that. 
>> Woodruff: I want to ask you about the availability of guns in this country after the terrible shooting in newtown, connecticut, killing of 20 first-graders. There's a lot of discussion about whether americans should have access that they have today. Do you think there should be limits on americans' access to guns. 
>> First of all it's horrible, horrible what happened to those children and the adults in that school. And every american, we know that and our heart goes out to those people. But I am a strong supporter of our second amendment rights. So I believe that we don't need to act swift swiftly now in reaction and having an emotional reaction to a horrible situation and put on limits on our constitutional rights. 
>> Woodruff: What about the national rifle association recommendation, the president spoke the other day and said the solution is having an armed guard in every school in the country. Do you think that's a good idea? 
>> I believe that was offered by former president bill clinton as the solution to violence also. Those decisions though need to be made at the local level. I was a school board member for over 20 years too. That's something that local districts need to look at and look at their needs and how they're to take care of all the needs of those students whether it's safety or education. 
>> Woodruff: The last thing, deb fischer, the folks who endorse you people like sarah palin, very conservative groups who believe that the federal government should play a very limited role, as limited a role as possible, in this country. What does that mean to you? What should there be less of? 

[00:52:15]


>> Well, I appreciated the support of governor palin who came in towards the end of the primary. I didn't have the support of clubs of growth. 
>> Woodruff: My mistake. I thought you did. 
>> And I didn't have at a party support either. I do believe in limited government. I believe government has certain priorities, and elected officials need to decide what those priorities are. You have to determine what the core responsibility of government is. I was a state senator for eight years, as you mentioned. As a state senator, I always based my decisions on the priorities that I believe wre a responsibility of state government. Those were public education, public safety, public infrastructure and taking care of those who truly can't care for themselves. We have to do that on a federal level as well. Because government can't be everything to everyone. You have to make those tough choices or we're going to continue to see our debt grow by more than $16 trillion, where we are now. That's not sustainable. That can't continue. And every american knows that. 
>> Woodruff: Deb fischer, about to be, to become a united states senator from the state of nebraska. You're coming at a very interesting time. Welcome. 
>> Thank you so much. 
Woodruff: Thank you. 
>> Suarez: Find the series of interviews with the newly elected senators on our politics page. 
>> Woodruff: Again, the major developments of the day. House republicans delayed action on a fiscal cliff compromise passed overwhelmingly by the senate. They demanded more spending cuts, leaving the bill in limbo. And new year's celebrations turned deadly overnight in ivory coast, when a crowd stampeded out of a fireworks show. More than 60 people were killed. The new year could bring a lot of new challenges to the affordable care act. Kwame holman explains. 

[00:54:20]


>> Holman: Will the health care debate reach the supreme court again this year? Challenges to the new law are percolating through the lower courts. We examine some of them on our health page. The amazon rain forest may be drying out. In the last few years, a patch of the forest in peru has been hit by two major droughts. We have a report from "scientific american" on our homepage. And how do you find the most success with internet job boards? Our "ask the headhunter" series has the answer. All that and more is on our web SITE, newshour.pbs.org. Ray? 
>> Suarez: And that's the newshour for tonight. I'm ray suarez. 
>> Woodruff: And I'm judy woodruff. We'll see you online, and again here tomorrow evening. Thank you, and we wish you a happy new year. 
>> Major funding for the pbs newshour has been provided by: 
>> Bnsf railway. 
>> And by the alfred p. Sloan foundation. Supporting science, technology, and improved economic performance and financial literacy in the 21st century.

=======================================================

Then, of cour, the debt ceiling, the nation will bump up against the debt ceiling. That really is a big reason that republicans think that they're going to move on on this. That's where they think they have their big leverage. 
>> We'll be back in an hour from now. Piers morgan tonight starts right now. Our coverage continues. 
>>> Breaking news tonight. You're looking live at capitol hill. The house of representatives. The house expected to vote this hour on the senate's fiscal cliff bill. And it's not an exaggeration to say that the health of america's economy may hang in the balance right now. You're going to want to stay right here and see what happens. We want to welcome our viewers in the united states and around the world. I'm wolf blitzer in for piers morgan. This is a real nail-biter we're watching, despite a threat by some republicans to add an amendment to the bill, an amendment that would have added over $300 billion in spending cuts and would have forced the bill back to the senate. The house is now on the verge of simply voting up or down on the senate bill as it stands. The package would increase taxes on individuals making more than $400,000 a year and couples making more than $450,000 a year. It would also extend unemployment insurance for a year for some 2 million people. And that house vote is expected to come this hour. We're watching it very closely. Let's bring in our senior congressional correspondent dana bash on capitol hill. She has the very latest on what's going on. Dana, I take it they started the actual debate, the vote could be fairly soon? 
>> They have started the debate on the procedural issues, but i just actually am getting an e-mail right now saying that the final vote, it doesn't look like it will happen until much later, until some time between 1:15 and 11:45 eastern. Initially we were told in this hour, but it seems to have been pushed back. Looks as though members do want to take the time to debate, to air out their concerns and perhaps their support for this, and so that's why we are, unfortunately, really going to go up to the -- go late into the night like last night. 

[00:02:17]


>> Basically what we're talking about is the exact version that passed the senate overwhelmingly in the middle of the night, 89-8. Here it is. This is the actual bill, about 150 pages that now the members of the house of representatives, democrats and republicans, they're considering. I assume, dana, that they have the votes between all the democrats, most of the democrats I suspect will vote for it. A lot of republicans will as well. Although probably not a majority, a majority, as they say. But they'll probably have 217 votes necessary to pass this legislation, send it to the president for his signature. 
>> There is confidence on both sides of the aisle that that is the case, wolf, that just like you said, that it wouldn't happen with just democrats, it wouldn't happen with just republicans. And stop the presses, there will be a bipartisan vote in congress and in the house, which we don't see a lot of on big, important and divisive issues, but it is because this is something that nobody loves because that's what compromises are, but there certainly seem to be enough house democrats, enough house republicans that they'll come together and vote on this for the simple reason that they understand that this really does matter to americans because officially, starting today, every american's taxes have gone up. They want to correct that as we've seen on press release after press release, 99% of americans to keep those in place. 
>> Is john boehner sticking to the old rule, the denny hastert rule, that you need a majority to bring it up for a vote. If the majority is not there of the republicans who are the majority in the house, he is not going to bring it up for a vote, or are they discarding that gi this current crisis? 
>> He's never been officially wedded to that majority of the majority idea. That has certainly been his goal in most if not all of the legislation that he's brought to the floor. This and a few others have tested that goal for sure, but look, this is something that republican speakers, hastert included, starting with hastert, have wanted to do to make sure they have the support with within, to make sure that there isn't any kind of revolt, there isn't a question of their leadership. Even though it has not been an easy road for john boehner, and that has been an understatement, I have not detected any real sentiment in the rank and file to have anybody but john boehner as their leader. To be honest with you, based on what boehner has gone through, it is hard to see anyone wanting that job right now. 

[00:04:57]


>> A tough job indeed. Dana standing by. Let's go to our white house correspondent jessica yellin is standing by. It looks like the president is going to get a win out of this. 
>> Yes, wolf, this is what they have been waiting for, but they're not breathing a sigh of relief yet because this is not done till it's done. But they've been watching all day, as we have. This is one time when they're essentially spectators. Once this hit a snag, once it went over the house, there was really not much they could do. You know, the vice president was over there this morning talking to house democrats because they knew that ultimately, once it got to the house floor, as dana pointed out, it would be democrats who will have to pass it. He answered a lot of democratic questions and concerns there, took some 20 questions I'm told for 45 minutes, laid out exactly step by step the process by which he negotiated this and got to this point and really made the case, and I'm told by multiple sources who were in the room that he was very persuasive. And the people here at the very highest levels are very confident that the democratic votes have been there all day, and they felt they would get here eventually, but it was a grueling process all day long. And hard for the white house to just sit here and watch it unfold. But the president is here at the white house at work. And ready to, if it's issue a paper stat]ment, that might be it, come out and speak, if that's it, he's here to do it if that's what they decide to do, but yes, this will be a relief here as well once this vote happens, wolf. 
>> So there's a possibility that he might actually go before cameras and make a statement assuming it passes the house? 
>> They're not saying that, but he is here in the building, and this would be a victory. So it would compute that he could potentially speak if the vote is held in the next couple of hours, which it will be. So we're waiting to see whether he speaks or issues a statement. And I'll keep you posted as soon as we know, wolf. 

[00:07:04]


>> So I speak as a former white house correspondent. I take it there's no full lid, as they say, over in the west wing at the white house, meaning that there's still a possibility that the tv crew are still there? 
>> They are still there. We have a dinnerlid, which means everybody -- it's safe to go out and get dinner and nothing's going to happen. If you go out and get dinner, you won't miss something, but you can come back and there's the potential for something to happen later. So it's not all done for the day yet. So we're not going anywhere, let's put it that way. 
>> I wouldn't be surprised if we see the president one way or another, especially obviously if this thing passes the house of representatives, he'll come out and thank everyone and then we'll start moving on and at some point have a signing ceremony, sign it into law and get ready for the next crisis which is not going to be that far down the road. 
>> That's right. I mean, this is a victory for the white house because it will address the tax concern. The president campaigned on this promise to raise taxes on upper income americans. It is not the same level he campaigned on. He said $250,000 and up, this is $450,000, but still the broad principle is kept. Now they're going to turn and pivot and fight over how to bring down the nation's deficit. The president will have to battle with the republicans. He'll make the case that it should be between revenues and spending cuts, and we all know republicans argue it should not include revenues. And the debt cs now going to be hit at the same time that this spending delay is hit in february. So we're going to have another titanic battle just two months from now. The big question is will the president take a little break and go to hawaii in between. We'll see, wolf. 
>> His family is still out there. I'm sure he'd love to head back to the state where he is born. Let's see what happens in the next couple of hours. Jessica, don't go too far away. One house republican who said he wa-- she was reluctant to support the bill, member of the house financial services committee is joining us now. Congresswoman, you'll vote which way for this senate bill? 

[00:09:18]


>> Wolf, I didn't hear your entire question, I'm sorry. 
>> Are you going to vote in favor of the senate bill or are you going to vote against it? 
>> I'm a very reluctant yes, wolf, because under these circumstances which exist, this last-minute situation exists because the folks just back behind me in the senate chamber, senator reid, could not get the senate to act on any of the great bills we sent before, this is the best we can do given the senate and the white house sentiment at that point in time. It is a partial victory for the american people in terms of tax relief for 99%. I'll take that at this point. 
>> Can I assume, congresswoman, that those republicans in the house who wanted to have some amendments, some additional spending cuts added to the senate bill that you simply didn't have the 217 votes you needed to pass that kind of legislation? Is that a correct assumption? 
>> I think that's probably a valid assumption, wolf. Again everybody in the conference, we've had a lot of very thoughtful discussion, very respectful discussion across the range of opinions within what is a strong and mutually supportive conference. So there certainly is tremendous sentiment within the conference to provide more relief from spending. It is the spending that has gotten us into this predicament. And it does need to stop, but this -- I think we have concluded that this particular bill will concentrate on the tax relief to the fullest extent we can provide it, and we will tackle the spending issue with all force starting tomorrow. 
>> You assume like I do that it will pass the house of representatives, a bipartisan majority, more than 217 votes and go to the president for his signature perhaps as early as tomorrow? 
>> That's what I anticipate, wolf, and I certainly will be glad to get this particular issue settled and now it's on to tackling that hideous problem that we have and we owe it to the american people to do everything we can. The president needs to lead on this. We need to have the right spending plan, the right kind of controls for the present, for the midterm and for the future. 

[00:11:43]


>> Congresswoman, thanks very much for coming in. Good luck down the road to you as well. 
>> Thank you. Happy new year. 
>> Thank you. Happy new year to you, too. Going over the fiscal cliff isn't just a problem for the american economy. Global markets are also watching what's going on. Let's bring in cnn's ali velshi. What a difference a few hours makes. It now looks like the senate-passed version will pass the house. The president will sign it into law. The fiscal cliff will be history. 
>> Things have turned upside down about four times in the last 24 hours. 24 hours ago you and I were talking about how we have faith in humanity, then everything turned upside down. I'm keeping an eye on international markets. U.S. Markets will open 24 hours from now. But asian markets are open. Tokyo won't open. It has a holiday. But we see trading in hong kong and seoul open. They're both up a little bit because everybody is doing what we're doing. They think this seems hopeful. If markets had opened six hours ago, they'd probably be down thinking now what's going to happen? But now it looks hopeful that the u.S. Will not go over the fiscal cliff if everything you heard from dana and jessica come to pass. For the moment international markets are cautious, they are trading just marginally higher, nobody's all too worried just yet. And they have eight more hours to trade. We'll keep an eye on this. This could be quite dangerous for the global economy because of the major economies out there, america is growing the fastest. China and india are obviously growing more than two or three times the speed of the american economy, but they are just not as big. Of the major economies america is the one holding things up while europe is still getting its act together. A whole lot of international concern on this right now. Frankly, if they hadn't done this vote tonight, which now we're think might happen in the next two hour, you would see a very strong reaction from wall street at 9:30 in the morning. 
>> We'll be watching it closely with you. Ali, thanks very much. Our viewers may be wondering who thing on the floor of the house of representatives is, that's david dwyer. The republican congressman from california. He's getting ready to leave congress. This will be one of his last acts in this current 112th congress.

[00:17:14]


>>> We're following the breaking news. We're awaiting a historic vote on the floor of the house of representatives. They're about to take up t senate-passed version of the fiscal cliff legislation that passed overwhelmingly in the senate last night 89-8 in favor, 40 republicans voting in favor INCLUDING mitch McConnell the senate republican leader. Let's discuss what's about to happen on the floor of the house. Joining us congresswoman debbie wasserman schultz. She's the chair of the democratic committee as well. She's got two hats. Congresswoman, thanks very much for coming in. How many democrats do you think will vote in favor of this senate-passed version? 
>> Well, I think it's hard to say. We've done a whip count. And I think that we will have -- ultimately we have 193, 192 democrats currently serving in the house, one open seat. I would say we'll have upwards of 150 members voting for the bill very likely. We've got to make sure we protect the middle class. This deal, although not perfect, makes sure that taxes don't go up on 98% of americans and 97% of small businesses. A good step towards what should ultimately be a balanced deficit reduction package. 
>> That empty seat is jesse jackson jr. Of chicago. That means that you don't need 218 votes to pass it, you need 217 vote to pass it. Do you have any doubt that this legislation will be passed tonight?S to pass it. Do you have any doubt that this legislation will be passed tonight? 
>> Actually, anyone watching this, wolf, should have just taken out some stock in drama mean because the rollercoaster ride that has resulted from us getting to this process really has been unfortunate and unnecessary but we're here. I'm glad to see that speaker boehner has put aside his requirements that they put a bill on the floor with the majority of the majority and we can see just exactly what a majority of the house does when it comes to making sure that we avoid tax increases on the middle class and giving some certainty to the those who really need it going into this new year. 

[00:19:28]


>> What do you say to the progressives, the liberals in the democratic caucus and outside groups who say this is a bad deal for the united states? The president capitulated, he caved, went up to 450,000 when he had campaigned on 250,000 being the limit for no new taxes, if you will? What do you say to those colleagues of yours who don't like this deal? 
>> I'm a progressive. I represent a progressive district. I say to them don't let the perfect be the enemy of the good. There are things in this deal i don't like. We've been here before. We've been saying all along that a balanced deal is going to mean that we'll be supporting things that not all of us really love, but my way or the highway politics is not the right way to go. That's what we've been criticizing republicans for. So I think this is a good deal. We get the tax rate increase for first time in more than 20 years, getting republicans to the table to agree to that on more than -- people making more than $450,000 a year. We have extensions of the unemployment benefits for 2 million people. We have extensions of the employment opportunity tax credit. That's more higher education opportunities for young people. The child care tax credit, the earned income tax credit. We have a permanent fix for the amt which is another big tax break for middle class families. This is a good deal. It's not perfect, but it's a good down payment on what should be the work that we need to do to finish the job on balanced approach to deficit reduction. 
>> Debbie wasserman schultz, the congresswoman from south florida. Thanks very much for coming in. 
>> Thank you, wolf. 
>>> Let's get a different reaction right now. Joining us a man you'd never think would have something good to say about tonight's bill, the anti-tax crusader grover norquist, president of americans for tax reform, but you agree, grover, with debbie wasserman schultz, if you were a member of the house or the senate, you'd be voting for this legislation as well? 
>> Yes. Keep in mind how much of a treat this is for the modern democratic party. The democrats have spent 12 years attacking the 2001/2003 bush tax cuts. They all voted against it. Obama attacked it regularly. Now they're out there helping to preserve about 84% of those tax cuts and making them permanent. The republicans and the taxpayers in this country have lived with a damocles sword over their head because the democrats so hated these tax cuts for the middle class and everybody else, that they made them temporary. And they ended several times. Two years ago obama let it go out for another two years. Now we're getting permanency for 98, 99% of americans with the bush tax cuts and obama's presidential campaign in 2012 changed his promise from 2008. 2008 he'd never raise any tax on anyone who earned less than $200,000. 2012 he said he wouldn't raise income taxes on anyone earning less than $200,000 this year, meaning 2013. He had only promised people he would protect the middle class from income taxes for 2013. What the republicans have won with this fight is permanent prottion for most americans on those taxes. 

[00:22:51]


>> But the reason that a lot of these conservative tea party republican types voted against it or are not going to vote for it tonight and they don't like it is because for the first time republicans in effect are going along with a tax increase, a rate increase of 35% to 39.6%, 4.6% tax rate increase for those individuals making more than $400,000 a year and families making more than $450,000 a year. So in effect, they're going along with a tax hike. 
>> No, absolutely not. The republicans in the house and the senate have made it very clear they wanted to extend those tax cuts permanently for everybody. They voted that way in 2001, 2003, again several times this last year. The republicans are on record, all of them, that all of these tax cuts should be extended -- this is obama's pound of flesh because he won the presidential election. He's the one insisting that tacks go up. They'll take $500 billion out of savings over the next decade and give it to the federal government. This is not helpful to the economy, and it will hurt the economy. Remember obama is not just raising taxes on the rich right now. We're about to enter a decade where a trillion dollars is going to be taken away from the american people in higher taxes to pay for obama-care. This was passed only by democrats. It is entirely a democrat tax increase. And it includes many taxes that directly hit middle income and lower income people. So obama's tax increase is not just the top tax rates. It's people -- if you have bad health problems and you spend more than 7.5% of your adjusted gross income on out of pocket health costs, you used to be able to deduct anything above that. Thanks to obama's law, obama-care, that's now 10%. So $2 million to $3 million will be taken out of people average income $53,000 a year, who are lower income, middle income and sick. They're going to be paying taxes for obama-care. There's an avalanche of obama tax increases coming next year. 

[00:25:09]


>> I just want to point out, grover norquist, though, having said all that and everything you said, you are giving cover to those republicans who will vote in favor of the senate legislation in the next hour or two? 
>> They're not voting for a tax increase, they're ving to save tax cuts for as many people as they can over obama's objections. 
>> Grover norquist would be voting with the president, would be voting with debbie wasserman schultz if in fact he were a member of the house of representatives. Grover, thanks very much. By the way, I want to point out that that roll call that's going on right now -- and we'll put it up on the screen and show you the roll call that's going on. This is a procedural vote on a resolution to go forward and begin the actual debate before the official roll call takes place in the next couple hours on the senate language, the senate version that passed last night overwhelmingly, but this is just a procedural vote in advance of the real vote that's coming up. I don't want our viewers to be concerned when they see the yeas and the nays present. We have a lot to follow on the breaking news. I'll speak to a democrat who says house republicans are in a state of chaos. I've always had to keep my eye on her... But, I didn't always watch out for myself. With so much noise about health care... I tuned it all out. With UnitedHealthcare, I get information that matters... My individual health profile. Not random statistics. They even reward me for addressing my health risks. So I'm doing fine... but she's still going to give me a heart attack. We're more than 78,000 people looking out for more than 70 million Americans. That's health in numbers. UnitedHealthcare. 

[00:29:31]


>>> We're awaiting a vote on the floor of the house of representatives on the fiscal cliff bill, a vote that could come some time after the 11:00 p.M. Eastern hour tonight. Joining us is new york congressman steve israel. He's the chairman of the democratic congressional campaign committee. Congressman, thanks very much for coming in. 
>> Sure, wolf, good to be with you. 
>> I assume you're in favor of this senate-passed language? 
>> Oh, I'm going to vote for it. There are things in the bill that I don't like. But unlike republican, I am willing to compromise. I'm willing to inject some pragmatism and some consensus into this process rather than obstruction at every step of the way. This day has been like a new year's day television marathon of the congress of chronic chaos with roller coasters and twists and turns and fancy footwork and high drama. It's unnecessary. The american people deserve compromise and pragmatism. At the end of the day, democrats will provide the votes necessary to protect the middle class, pass this bill, move us forward. 
>> You agree with debber wassermchultz, 150 democrat will vote in favor? 
>> I'm interested in seeing how many votes the republicans are going to provide. They are in the majority. They do have a responsibility and accountability to the american people for voting. I want to see how many votes they provide. But at the end of the day, it will be democrats, enough democrats will vote on this in order to rescue the middle class from this and move the country forward. We provided some adultd leadership and adult supervision to a process that was essentially run by children up to now. 
>> You say children you're talking about the speaker of the house and the majority leader? Talking about tea party republicans who continue to throw temper tantrums and delay this and refuse to move forward in the spirit of compromise. Every time we move towards them, they moved away from us. At a certain point, you have to be able to take yes for an answer, especially when we're giving you what you wanted. 
>> You are making at least for 98% of the american people or so those bush era tax cuts, the tax cuts that went into effect in 2001/2003, you're making them permanent now. That's something that republicans always wanted. You're giving them in effect that because the democrats by and large almost unanimously opposed those tax cuts. You know there's going to be another huge battle in the next month or two when raising the debt ceiling comes up. And the republicans think they're going to have the upper hand in that battle.

>> Well, look, I'm not interested in who has the upper hand. I'm interested in doing what needs to be done to protect the middle class, to strengthen, improve and reform medicare and social security. And frankly, as the chairman of the democratic congressional campaign committee, I'll take a battle where the republicans continue to protect special interests, oil corporation subsidies, big farm subsidies if that's the fight thfy want. I hope they've learned their lesson from today and the past several weeks that compromise and cooperation and pragmatism works and that obstructionism, it doesn't work for them, it doesn't work for the middle class, it doesn't work for the american people. Let's get to solutions. 
>> You think the republican leadership, the speaker, the majority leader, some of the other leaders, they're all on the same page or are they fighting amongst themselves? 
>> Oh, I think a good part of this has had nothing to do with an economic strategy. It's ab political strategy by house republicans. This has been internecine war and they've put their own partisan interests and parochial interests ahead of those of the american people. We could have done this a week ago. The proof positive is when after rejecting the president's compromise, which is what we're very close to tonight, speaker boehner put a bill on the floor to create a $1 million trigger for tax increases and they wouldn't even pass that. So this is more about internal republican dynamics than it is moving the economy forward. Thankfully we have a new congress coming in on thursday, fewer tea party extremists, and I hope that that bodes well for the american people and the new congress. Because this congress that we've had up to now under this republican leadership just has not worked. 
>> Steve israel, we'll see you in the new congress starting on thursday as well. Thanks for joining us. 
>> Thanks, wolf. 
>>> Let's bring in contributor and "new york times" columnist ross douthat. Who is the big winner, who is the big loser in this fight? 

[00:34:05]


>> Well, I mean overall the big loser, sir, is obviously the republicans because they have to swallow tax increases that they didn't want to swallow, but we've known that that was going to happen ever since barack obama was re-elected president of the united states. So given that context, given that taxes were going up no matter what, I think that republicans a decent job of negotiating the president and senate democrats upward on the threshold for tax increases, and I think that they can walk away tonight thinking, well, if we were going to lose, you know, we lost a little -- you know, we didn't lose as badly as we could have. I was listening to the congressman. Obviously he's right in many ways the republican party is dysfunctional right now. It's a defeated party. It lost the last election. It doesn't really know what it stands for. It's having to swallow policy changes it didn't want to accept. Given that dysfunction, I think you could make a case that john boehner has handled things fairly cleverly over the past week or so, dealing with a revolt from his right, sort of passing the buck over to the senate, letting the senate negotiate a bill and then letting his own membership basically spend the afternoon venting and then sort of coming around to what looks like will actually be the passage of the compromise that averts the scary fiscal cliff that everybody's been talking aut for weeks now. So you can make a case that in terms of sort of managing the politics and sort of the internal dynamics of the house and senate, the republican leadership has done the best job they could have. 
>> Were you surprised the president was willing to go up to $450,000 from $250,000 which he had spoken of for months and months and months during the campaign? 
>> Well, I wasn't completely surprised because there are a lot of democrats particularly in the senate, particularly reprng wealthy states like new york, chuck schumer, for example, who always kind of wanted that threshold to go up a bit. Americans making between, say, 100,000 and $350,000 a year living in new york, san francisco, los angeles and so on, those are actually key democratic constituents, key democratic funders and so on. So I think there's always been a bit for resistant to tax increases among democratic politicians than you'd sometimes hear. And I think that could be a problem fr the democrats down the line because in the end, if you're going to preserve the government we have in the form the democrats like, they're going to have to raise taxes on somebody besides the people they're raising taxes on tonight. 

[00:36:40]


>> Hey, ross, thanks very much for coming in. 
>> Sure, thanks so much, wolf. 
>> And coming up, I'll ask my panel of political all-stars who comes out on top in this messy CHAPTER OF AMERICAN POLITICS.9??s# ??q 

[00:40:32]


>>> Cbo has already said 3.967, in other words, $4 trillion will be added to the debt over ten years with this tax cut unless we do some spending cuts to help offset it. Right now the president's still in a spending mood. We need to get him in a savings mood. 
>> That's republican congressman darrell issa of california. He's hammering home the republican message of spending cuts above all else. The breaks news we're following is ben smit of buzz feed, carol roth radio host and maria cardona, the democratic strategist and cnn contributor and ali velshi our chief business correspondent. What do you make of this deal that looks like it's going to be a deal, the house looks like it's going to follow the senate's lead, carol, pleat go to you first. Good deal or bad deal? 
>> Well, I guess it depends on for who. For the american people I think this is a mediocre deal at best because it doesn't have a solution. I have a very hard time throwing a parade for a congress that took 13 months to get a mediocre solution that doesn't address spending, doesn't address the debt, raises taxes not only on the wealthy but I keep hearing it's not raising taxes on the middle class. That's not true. The payroll tax cut is expiring. So taxes are going up for everybody. We're going to endn a situation where we end up fighting over the debt ceiling and sequestration in two months. So maybe the market makes out okay but the american people didn't make out okay with this. 
>> But that payroll tax cut was always seen as a temporary measure. Neither democrats nor republicans were really pushing to keep it going. 
>> And I agree. 
>> Yeah, go ahead. 
>> I was going to say that i agree. I think it's a good thing, but i do think that we should be honest and not let the political rhetoric get in the way and be very, very clear that this is a tax hike on everybody. 

[00:42:35]


>> Go ahead, maria. You want to respond. 
>> Sure, absolutely. It is not a tax hike on everybody. Yes, people's paychecks will go up a little bit. But we knew from the very beginning when we had the payroll tax cut that that was going to be temporary. This is a very good deal for the american people because it avoids huge tax hikes for 98% of the american families who are hurting, 98% of small businesses who are also hurting. That is a very good thing for the majority of the american people tonight who now know that their taxes are not going to go up. For the long term, I agree, and the president agrees and democrats agree a lot more works needs to be done. Nobody deserves a parade tonight. But we can sleep soundly that our taxes and the majority of the taxes for the american people are not going to go up. We do need to deal with spending. That was always going to be part of a grand bargain. And let's remember, the speaker boehner is the one who has actually walked away more than three times from a grand bargain with this president that would have dealt with trillions in spending. Let's hope that we can get to dealing with spending and job creation. 
>> Who is the big political winner tonight, ben? 
>> I think president obama played a much stronger hand in this sort of shoving match over particularly forcing republicans to go ahead and raise taxes on the rich. He won that. What he didn't get, which he wanted was kind of a clean slate for the year. A big deal today, then moving forward other legislative priorities. Instead he'll begin his second term fighting over taxing and spending and the same things for the last two years. 
>> There's going to be a whole bunch of fights, ali, coming up, including raising the dead ceiling in february or march. The president says he's not playing that game with republicans any more. But what can he do? You got to pass legislation in the senate and the house to raise the debt ceiling. Hoiz the country at least technically goes into default. 
>> The president has to be careful to say things he's not going to do that he gets forced to do. The debt ceiling is not a sensible way of dealing with borrowing. There are other ways to do it. Other countries have much more effective ways to do this. Bottom line if he doesn't get an agreement on raising the debt CEILING WHICH HE HIT ON THE st Of december, they can play around with this around the board but if he doesn't get that increase, the government could come the a shutdown and we could be sitting around one night at 9:45 like we are now talking about that. The president is going to have to deal with that. I call that the valentine's day cliff, then we'll have the st. Patrick's day cliff because they kick the sequester two months down. Then we'll have a budget fight. There are going to be three fights that look very much like this one. For anybody who thinks they lost any battles tonight, we'll have three more like this. There are no particular winner in this. We have status quo and with that payroll tax holiday having expired everyone who works will see less money in their paychecks. No real winners, just who lost less today. 

[00:45:43]


>> If you like this fight, get ready. There will be two, three, four more fight in the next three weeks and months that will be very similar. Some people calling it the new normal here in washington. Everybody stay put. We have a lot more to discuss. When we come back, I'm going to ask all of you what you think this big battle means for john boehner. You can watch videos and text. Or you could watch the earnings report and take notes, like we're supposed to. So... can I get it? Yeah. Okay Either of you put together the earnings report? Yes, me totally. Why don't you tackle the next quarter while we go to lunch. Pu Pu platter? Yup! Keep up the good work. I will keep up the good work. Do more with the new Samsung Galaxy Note II.

[00:49:37]


>>> They just passed the rule on the floor of the house of representatives. So now the real debate on the senate-passed legislation can begin. There you see senator levin, the congressman from michigan, who is speaking right now. He's a democrat. Carl levin's a democrat, carl levin's brother, sandra levin, member of the house of representatives. We're back with our excellent panel. We expect the final vote, by the way, in about an hour or so from now, maybe a little bit more than an hour from now. But let talk about political fallout. Assuming it passes, ben smith, what do you think the future for john boehner, t speaker, is? 
>> I think he was just overheard on the floor of the house calling tonight a nightmare for him. It's been that kind of day. But there's no challenge to his speakership. I don't think anybody wants the job. I think some people like the idea of a weakened speaker, which is what he is. His break not with the majority of members but with all members, including the democrats, was a sign of weakness. It seemed a little frayed tonight. 
>> Johoehner is a patriot and he thinks this vote is great for the country. He doesn't love it, the president doesn't love necessarily every aspect it have but he recognizes that a vote against the senate bill would be a disaster for millions and millions of americans whose taxes would go up rather dramatically. It cond the economy into a recession right now. So I think the speaker is doing what he thinks is the right thing to do, even if a majority of republicans don't agree with him. 
>> I think there are different ways you could have negotiated this and this is the olive branch strategy. I think what it comes down to is that it is the right strategy. However, it's unfortunate again that we're here 13 months later and that boehner/obama couldn't get this down, boehner/reid couldn't get this done. We had to bring in joe biden to get this done. I'm not sure anybody else wants the job so I think the job is safe for boehner but I don't think this is something that really bodes well for his effectiveness, at least within the party's thought process zip 

[00:52:07]


-- 
>> I think owinners, maria, joe biden. 
>> I completely agree, wolf. I think joe biden has done a spectacular job of bringing people together, but I will also say this is a win for senator McCONNELL BECAUSE HE ART OF That team that made this deal come together and he aured that the majority of republicans in the senate were going to support this deal. Let's think about that. Who knew that in this divided congress that we were going to be able to get a deal on the fiscal cliff where in the senate it was going to pass with the majority of republican support. AND mitch McConnell, my hat goes off to him because I don't think we expected that that was going to be the case. So I think vice president biden, AS WELL senator McConnell are big winners in this. 
>> Say what you will, ali, but it's nice to see so bipartisan on the senate side and now we'll see some bipartisan in the house of representatives. 
>> I'm very impressed. Economically there are no big winners, everybody is a bit of a loser. The one thing story is a guy you and I have spoken to in the last couple days, grover norquist. He's absolutely been a loser in this equation. He made everybody swear they would never ever under any circumstances ever, no matter what happened, if there was an asteroid coming to hit earth raise taxes and he signed off on this. He told you himself he would support this plan. That's very strange. I think grover norquist is trying to save face. Grover norquist and others in the republican have had to give up something they said they would never give up. They're all sounding like compromiser all of a sudden. 
>> What what does this aabout the tea party then? >>. 

[00:54:08]


>> This was a decision by boehner to go around the right side of his party. 
>> There's certainly been a rebalancing after the election. 
>> Thanks very much. Ali will be back at 11:00 p.M. Eastern. We're not going away. History unfolding on the floor of the house of representatives. Much more after this. ?????? I wish my patients could see what I see. ?????? ?????? that over time, having high cholesterol and any of these risk factors can put them at increased risk for plaque buildup in their arteries. So it's even more important to lower their cholesterol, and that's why, when diet and exercise alone aren't enough, I prescribe crestor. In a clinical trial versus lipitor, crestor got more high-risk patients' bad cholesterol to a goal of under 100. 
[ Female Announcer ] CRESTOR IS NOT RIGHT For everyone. Like people with liver disease or women who are nursing, pregnant or may become pregnant. Tell your doctor about other medicines you're taking. Call your doctor right away if you have muscle pain or weakness, feel unusually tired, have loss of appetite, upper belly pain, dark urine or yellowing of skin or eyes. These could be signs of rare but serious side effects. ?????? ?????? is your cholesterol at goal? Talk to your doctor about crestor. 
[ Female Announcer ] IF YOU CAN'T AFFORD Your medication, AstraZeneca MAY BE ABLE TO HELP. r r r r r 

[00:58:25]


>>> There she is, nancy pelosi, the democratic leader in the house of representatives. She support as vote in favor of the senate-passed legislation. She's making that clear on the floor of the house. We're getting ready for a vote within the next hour or so. Dana bash, arguably the hardest working woman in television right now is joining us once again from the united states capitol. Give us the latest, around 11:00, 11:15 is whether the roll call will take place? 
>> We got a little bit of good news that it might happen in the 10:00 hour. Perhaps that means members are as tired as everybody else and they're willing to give back debate time to vote. But one thing that's happened since you and I last talked is you mentioned there was a vote on the rule, a procedural vote that needs to happen before the actual legislation. What was significant about that is the vote was 408-10. That almost never happens around here. That means it was a procedural vote that got big bipartisan vote, big democratic votes. That really is a signal about how this is going to be, not necessarily the final vote but a signal about how much democrats want to be part of this final compromise. 
>> Good to see bipartisanship breaking out last night, now in the house of representatives, puts a smile on my face and a smile on your face pip assume once the house passes it tonight and I think they will, the president will sign it into law right away. We'll see if he then heads out to hawaii to meet up with his family.

We're doing a show, welcome to redye new year's mildly enjoyable eve. I'm greg gutfeld, coming up this awesome awesomeness. 
>> Naked protestors protesting naked in san francisco. And spaniards waging war with tomatoes and a dog, shampooed to within an inch of its life. Athletic young men clawing their way to the top. Rhinos in japan, hell-bent on destruction x and a doberman, battling until they collapse. A yorky can fly all over. A possum feasting on fruit z later human flesh. Getting into bags. A lion with a taste for toddlers. They're not friends. More like frenemies. And we'll get to the bottom of that, and much more. 
>> Wow. Welcome our guests. Plus, she's the vava voom of the newsroom, laurie rothman and he's our very own cat lady except he's a dude with, cats. Andy levy. And he lives in a bush bit UNDERPASS-w??E 

[00:03:10]


>> This always happens in 197s we said america was going to be dead there was going to be starvation, population bloms, everybody said we're going down but we keep coming back. We're number one. 
>> I'm tired of hearing we're going down. Let's get there. 
>> Okay. 
>> We're no longer the super power. And I've been hearing from little kids that white people goring to be in the minority. Wh is it going to happen? I want to be a minority. In fifth grade, I'm not going to be a minority until I'm in MY 70s. Not going to be any good then. 
>> With that jacket you are a minority. You're a strange little man. 
>> Can you concentrate on the fact we're doing a show? 
>> Do you want my patriotic response? 
>> Yes. How about yes. 
>> Honest? Maybe it's not such a bad thing to not have to be e super power and in the to have to bail everybody out. That is my fiscal conservative answer. My patriotic answer? China lies about money. Europe probably isn't going to be what we know of it today. The emerging markets, other stronger economies are turning but nowhere near u.S.. You're rolling your eyes at me. It's the patriotic answer the u.S. Will hold on to domination. 
>> Look. 
>> I like it when she's -- . 
>> I was just going to say it's a new year's show, we don't want to have that much fun. 
>> I was in the tuning out but thinking about what I was going eat tonight. Hannity. You're the optimist. Reaffirm how bright america's future is. 
>> It's, I don't thinkc'?? all votes have been counted yet. It's premature. I am optimistic because we're always going to be cyborgs and using other realities to interact with the world. It's my dream to live in a world where I zront to interact with people at all this, is perfection. There are 3 d printers now. They're going to be amazing. 

[00:05:24]


>> This is huge. 
>> Yes. If if they perfect it to the point where it can create food, I won't have to talk to the delivery man. I can go a year without talking to another person once very my avatar and 3 d printer. 
>> The last one was doomsberg. 
>> By 2030 you will have been dead by 15 years. Does that make you sad? 
>> It makes me sad. 
>> Oh. But the question wasn't for you, crazy lady. Talking to bill. Bill? 
>> Yes. 
>> Talking to the otherrazy lady. 
>> We don't see gender, andrew. I am with laurie because she supported me. I think we spend too much money on defense, let's let someone else be a world cop. 
>> That is what I said. 
>> Now, I'm going differ a little bit. Do you want to knjz+something about the future? 2030 look no further than a little movie I like to call "minority report". Speilberg hired futurists but so many things have come true. Touch screen technology, tom cruise uses? We use all the time. Not to that extend but car that's drive themselves. It's being worked on in detroit. 
>> Yes. 
>> And, that is right we'll start what will happen is that we'll get people into prison before they do crimes. 
>> I will be 65 years old. Which means my tiny island will be complete. Also, I'll have a new tv show. D it's a half hour of me setting up the hept. 
>> We're just making it up. 
>> Yes. That is all it is. 
>> Yes. 
>> Then, humiliating them. 
>> All right. 2030. Two words. We acted 2012. I acted 12. But jerks like chris brown said jerky things online. There are probably other things of internet nasiness. I won't know it. Surveys show america thinks social media is to blame z one expert noted about election related tweets quote the fact many people post under anonymous handles gives them permission to use foul language fwh describing candidate they expose. Push leads tve, then this, happens. So I've been exposed and i apologize to them. It's tom. Shut up. It's sliming. Does it seem that way because of twitter? 

[00:08:29]


>> It does. That is g people shouldn't worry bit that. Is why we??dz have twitter. Yes, people are more rude but you shouldn't take it personally. They do not get offended when someone dises me whose avatar is a kurt russell character. 
>> If they're dissing you there it steers it away from real life. Someone might diss new real life who. Knows andy if our country is polaroid polarized polaroid? Is that a bad thing? 
>> I don't know. I exprose poesed what you just said. I expose what you just said too, this, snot a good thing. Polar saigs is final and normal, healthy for people to disagree with each other. But instability you're acting like it's only online. Of course, everyone is rude to each other, subway doors in manhattan. When I lived here growing up IN THE 80s SUBWAY AND DOORS Open people stood off to the side. People to get off first now they stand in front of the door autos that is when they were murdering -- crime is lower now than back then. Now, there are ruder pele who are less killable.

>Hello I'm Patrice King Brown and you are watching HTV. Has it become and more difficult to remember names? Do you struggle to find the right word? Or maybe you find yourself walking into a room or store and forgetting why you were going there in the first place? Well today's show is all about memory loss about brain fog and the other symptoms of mental decline. So many people live in fear that they're mental decline will result in losing they're independence, That family members will no longer allow them to make there own decisions or even drive. Its terribly freighting. Think about this. Does this sound like you or perhaps a family member? Has it become increasingly difficult to remember what you've just read, or perhaps you now struggle to follow a conversation or retain the Sunday sermon you used to look forward to all week? How about being confused while driving- forgetting directions someone gave you, forgetting where you're going, or even worse... forget how to get home? Imagine that? Well If you're experiencing more an your share of mental confusion and frustration., then today's show is for you. Medical science can correct many of the challenges of old age -From synthetic joints to improving mobility to prescription glasses to instantly correct age-related vision loss - but when our mind and memory begin to fail, many people wonder what can modern science do? Is it even possible for an age-ravaged brain to be brought back to 'normal again?' Today, we'll learn about an amazing technological breakthrough that may do for the brain what prescription glasses do for the eyes. It's a brain-boosting memory pill that may make tired, old brains feel young again. My guest today, is a gifted head and neck cancer surgeon, He's a PhD of psychologist as well. He is an expert on the brain, and knows firsthand about this remarkable life-changing

development that's giving people back their independence. Welcome, America's Brain doctor, Dr. Paul Nemiroff. It is a pleasure to have you here today. >>Thank you, Patrice. And thank you for the invitation. You know I'm always excited to have an opportunity to speak with people about this important breakthrough in helping to reversing memory loss. >So, doctor, tell us your story. How did you learn about this amazing development? >>You know I became aware of this a number of years ago, And I was working like a crazy 80 hours a week, Doing surgery's, A family, Running around doing all sorts of things I was exhausted. And I started onder, am I starting to lose it mentally with respect to my memory. Things weren't sticking like they did before. >Uh... is that a medical term? Sticking? >>No, Its not a Medical term but it's accurate and I thought to myself was I somehow not as mentally efficient? Had I burnt out some circuitry? I was really concerned because you know my brain is what I use everyday. And I did what I've done throughout my career. I began researching the literature to see what, if anything, was available... I looked for something to wake up my brain and re-energize my memory. >So what did you find? >>Well one day during my research I came across an intresting article, fascinating article in a medical journal about a drug-free compound call Procera AVH. That consists of three ingredients designed to address the root causes of forgetfulness and poor concentration. A team of scientists identified a cluster of age-related symptoms which some people call Premature Mental Decline. That's a term we use now. And anyone over the age of 45 or 50, 55 may recognize the symptoms. They can include examples like you mentioned earlier Patrice, stemming from memory lapses, the inability to concentrate and stay focused, brain fog or fuzzy thinking, low mental energy and mental fatigue just to name a few. >Well that sounds like so many people today. It seems that maybe this problems a little more prevalent than it was in the past. I always thought it was normal aging though? 

[00:04:02]


>>No, No its not normal aging its quite widespread and years for years now people just chalked it up to that, of growing older. However, as a physician, I can tell you nothing could be further from the truth. Research now suggests that for many, these problems may be caused by a handful of relatively easily corrected conditions in the brain. >So, are you telling me that Procera AVH can help make the senior moments a thing of the past, or at least be less of a problem? Because I have seen first hand confusion, Pain, Frustration of mental decline that seniors can feel. >>Well, for many the answer may be yes Patrice... Procera AVH accomplishes this in three stages. First, blood flow and oxygen to the brain can slow with age, so Procera provides increased blood flow to your brain, bringing more oxygen and more vital nutrients. This is critical, these are some of the important fuels that power the brain that you need. Like you know, You've gone outside before and taken a breath of fresh air on a cool day, it can help wake up and mentally energize a tired, sluggish brain. >Now you use this Procera AVH, have you noticed the same energizing benefit that you've just mentioned? >>YES, I have! I was amazed at how my brain reacted within the first week of trying Procera! It was amazing. I noticed my mental clarity was better and that my focus was much sharper. I compare it to reading an eye chart say at the optometrist's office with the right pair of glasses for the first time. Everything snaps into focus, your brain feels more crisp, more focused, sharp and d clear. >That's pretty amazing. >>And I quickly felt like I did when I was younger. I felt I had my mental edge back. It was that dramatic Patrice. > You know well that's very important and very impressive. Ok, so tell me exactly how does Procera AVH help a forgetful brain? >>One of the more brilliant aspects of the formula is how it helps the brain talk to itself... > I don't want to interrupt you now Doctor, but when "I" think about it talking to it's self I'd get funny looks if I did that kind of thing. Not that way? >>No, not the same thing Patrice. Procera improves what's called intra-brain communication by helping the little brain cells communicate with each other in a 

[00:06:03]


more efficient manner To do this, your brain relies on billions of tiny messenger molecules called neurotransmitters. But with age and years of stress, the brain can begin to run low on neurotransmitters. When it reaches a tipping point, your brain can begin to sputter and lose function. >Scatter brained, right? >>That's correct. Procera can help re-supplies your brain with memory-boosting neurotransmitters, doing this naturally which can help you think faster, learn and remember more readily and have a sharper, crisper mind. >What else does Procera do? >>Well, over the course of a lifetime, free radicals and brain pollutants can also take a toll on your brain health. Once you take Procera AVH, it goes to work, helping to reduce those mind-dulling free radicals and toxins. It does this with a sophisticated mix of brain-specific antioxidants. >So do Doctors recommend Procera for their patients? >>Well Patrice, there are few, if any, brain health supplements, that I know of, that physicians feel comfortable recommending to their patients, much less using personally. Procera AVH is one of them however that people do recommend and Doctors do as well. And It's a natural formula, which means it contains no drugs, which seniors will greatly appreciate, nobody wants to take another medication. And it's something that's actually beneficial for your brain and body, when taken daily. >Yes, but drugs are clinically tested and supplements usually are not, right? >>You're right, and that's usually the case, but the in the case of Procera AVH the formula was really put through the grinder - a double blind placebo controlled clinical study. In fact, it used the same rigorous FDA-approved cognitive function tests that are used in pharmaceutical drug trials. It worked so well that Procera AVH users saw a significant improvement in memory, focus, concentration, mental energy and even mood even mood in just 30 days. >Wow! That is impressive. Ok, but when I start taking Procera how will I really know it's working? I mean there's no way to actually measure improvements in my brainpower and focus, or is there..? 

[00:08:04]


Let's get to that next Dr. Nemiroff, but right now I want to give our viewers a chance to call and get more information. If you would like more information on Dr. Nemiroff, or your interested in how America's #1 brain health supplement, Procera AVH may specifically help you, then pick up the phone and call the number you see on your screen. As always, at HTV we have worked out a special arrangement with our guest, so when you do call, be sure to mention HTV and you'll receive a bonus free month supply of Procera AVH. And I've also been told, for a limited time, we have some very nice free gifts for those who call today and try Procera AVH. Including a free copy of the medically acclaimed book, 20/20 Brainpower, with the program Dr. Nemiroff recommends based upon the suggested Mayo Clinic guidelines for brain health and longevity. We have trained representatives standing by who can answer all of your questions. So, if you'd like some more information and your free month supply of Procera AVH and book, then pick up the phone now and give of us call >And If you're just tuning in.. I'm Patrice King Brown and you're watching HTV. And my guest today is surgeon and psychologist, Dr. Paul Nemiroff, he is America's brain Doctor. The topic of today's show is memory and mental decline. Now before the break Dr. Nemiroff we were talking about Procera AVH, which of course now your telling me is a stunning break through nutritional supplement not medicine, Not a drug for memory that can do for the brain what prescription glasses does for the eyes. >>That's right, Patrice. And just like a good pair of glasses can make fuzzy, out-of-focus vision, sharp and crystal-clear, for many Procera AVH can make a tired, sluggish, forgetful brain, feel razor sharp and alert. It's a clinically tested formula that was shown to help improve memory, focus and concentration, and even mood. And was clinically shown that it can even help people who take Procera reclaim up to 15 years of lost memory and brain power in as little as 30 days. 

[00:10:06]


>Wow! That is impressive. Now before the break you were talking about measuring memory and brainpower. So, if I take Procera I, Can I get a measurement to prove it's working for as well? >>Absolutely! In fact every person who tries Procera AVH receives a free brain test from Brain Research Labs to assess and measure his or her memory and brainpower. And you take the test privately in your own home, So no ones watching to see how you do and it only takes a few minutes to complete. Can even fun! And you can retake the test whenever you want to see that your actually getting improvementsh Procera and its making in your mental performance. >I've never heard of such a thing, but I do I like the idea though that you can actually measure your mental improvement, And I like the idea that you can do it in the privacy in your own home. Now everywhere I go I have to ask you about this, I see people drinking those energy drinks. It seems that there doing it all the time? Now, Let me ask you how can Procera AVH make these amazing improvements in the brain with out using drugs or pharmaceutical additives? Whats the secret? >>That's a great question, Patrice. The researcher who developed the formula knows the human brain like the back of his hand. He knew that it was possible to make dramatic changes in the brain by combining very precise amounts of certain natural brain energy nutrients, each has a long history of safety and effectiveness around the world. In fact, as you see here, just one of the ingredients alone in Procera was shown to energize a dull, tired brain in less than an hour. >Wow, that is quite a difference! Look it energized things lit up that aging brain looks kind of like a Christmas tree its so lit up! >So let me try to sum this up Dr. Nemiroff.. Procera boosts circulation to the brain, providing those fresh supplies of oxygen and nutrients you mentioned, and it increases levels of neurotransmitters. That .. what are neurotransmitters again? I'm sorry! I probably could use some Procera myself today. >>That's ok, this is new information to most people you know? Neurotransmitters in a medical term here are those chemical messengers in your brain responsible for memory for concentration, alertness, and 

[00:12:07]


even decision making, It also helps with overall thinking and processing information. >And then you talked about how the toxins in our air, in our food, in our water and we hear about them all the time how they can effect how the way the brain functions.. >>Thst's correct Patrice, to further help improve your mental clarity and quickness, Procera can help neutralize those free radicals and dangerous brain toxins that we just cannot avoid in today's world. So it's a triple formula that has a triple action. >Now a good friend of mine swears by that popular brain ingredient of the 90's, alot of people were taking ginkgo biloba. >>Mhm > How does that stack up against Procera AVH? >>No comparison actually in my opinion. While ginkgo has been shown to help enhance brain circulation, more recent studies were really inconclusive. And many don't feel any difference. They don't know if its working. It simply can't hold a candle to Procera's patented triple-action approach to memory improvement. >Well, I will definitely pass that information on to my friend. Right now, I'd like to take a few moments to share with our viewers some experiences from some people who have taken Procera over time from all across the country. I have a few letters here that I'd like to share and some of the comments. Okay? Lets see what they have to say. Some of them are health care professionals as well. You know, I have seen many people Dr. Nemiroff, go down hill mentally after retirment and its a very sad situation. You plan your whole life to retire and things don't work out. So we do have a story here about a retired college professor. And his name is Richard, He's from Seabrook, SC. And just after he retired, Richard went into a deep funk, and he just couldn't get up the mental energy to do any of the things that he was waiting to do at this stage in his life. Like so many other people. And then, thanks to his son, he discovered Procera AVH, And soon after taking it he felt like he awakened from a slumber. And Richard writes that he started taking guitar lessons, that he took up painting, something that he never imagined he had the skills to do. And remarkably he even already has very first piece now into an art gallery! This all after retirement its a 

[00:14:08]


nereer he was back to his old creative and productive self again. >>Nice story. What seems to have happened here is that retirement may have caused his brain to go into a so Sluggish motion It needed some stimulation. You know the move it or lose it thing and some good brain nutrition to get it active and vibrant again. And that's just what Procera does, it helps restore depleted oxygen and neurotransmitter levels getting those neurons fired up again! > Boy that's good! And as you mentioned earlier again, in addition to stress, and aging, and toxins causing premature mental decline, there are certain medical procedures and im sure some kind of medications as well that can contribute to memory loss or to that low mental energy, and mental confusion. One woman wrote in to say that at age 50, and " you know I don't know about you but I don't think that 50 is allt old" after a medical procedure this woman tried to go back to school she wanted to get her advanced degree. Now Unfortunately, she could barely concentrate, and her memory and her ability to learn and retain new information she says seemed " to be gone forever." Well after reading about Procera AVH, she decided to give it a try and that's when she wrote to us to tell us her story... With Procera she could now "focus and retain information just like she could when she was 25". >>Wow. >That's quite an improvement, And she says that she's not only got her advanced degree but she's very excited she also a great new job too! >>That's terrific! And we get this feedback all the time, it can also happen when women go through menopause or other hormonal changes, and there's also a condition called chemo-brain which can reallywipe out a person's memory as well. Unfortunately many popular medications like cholesterol medication, sleep allergies and others can also contribute to memory problems. You know stressful life changes like a divorce can also affect memory and accelerate mental decline. And Procera can help. >Wow? Well here is a letter also from a commercial airline pilot who says he harnesses Procera's natural mental energy to ensure mental sharpness and endurance while flying. And I don't know about you but I wanna make sure the pilots being 

[00:16:09]


pretty good. >>You want him sharp. >That's right you want him sharp. >The pilot wrote "Many of my trips are all-nighters or 'red-eye' flights. I find that Procera AVH gives me greater mental clarity and endurance throughout the flight." So im happy that he never? >>I can't agree more, Patrice. think if you're especially responsible for the safety of others, Procera AVH can provide you with additional confidence and security that you'll be at your best. It certainly has changed lives. >I want to take a minute now and give our viewers a chance to call for more information. Now If you'd like more information on Dr. Nemiroff, or are interested in how America's #1 brain health supplement, Procera AVH, can help improve your memory, Your focus, Your concentration, and even mood.

todays show just for you! I urge you to stay with us for the next few minutes because the information you're about to hear has changed lives and can change your life as well. My guest today is America's Brain Doctor, Dr. Paul Nemiroff, he's a head and neck cancer surgeon he's also a doctor of psychology. And today we're discussing the new brain health phenomenon known as Procera AVH. So earlier in the show you made an analogy that Procera AVH can have the same effect on an older brain that prescription glasses have on older eyes. What did you mean by that? >>Well thank you again for the introduction Patrice. Let me first say that just because our health changes as we get older, that doesn't necessarily mean that it has to stay that way. Here's a good example. Every year, millions of Americans will schedule an annual checkup with their optometrist to correct their age-related changes in their vision. Yet very few people are even aware that they can do something to help correct the age-related memory loss. > Why is that? >>Well it's because they simply didn't know that life can be different, But with Procera they may now be able to do something about it. And that's important. Give people chance give people hope.. >And how does Procera AVH make that foggy brain, sharp again? >>Procera AVH works by addressing some correctable conditions in the brain, which often can be associated with aging, stress, toxins, and medications. As we mentioned as we age, circulation to the brain is reduced for a number of reasons. This can have a serious effect. When blood flow to the brain is restricted, the supply of oxygen and nutrients needed for optimal brain function can be reduced. This has an immediate effect on mental alertness, your ability to concentrate and focus. It can also diminishes recall, which can reduce your short-term memory. >And what about stress? Everybody's dealing with some form of stress, and over the course of many years it can really deplete reserves of those little neurotransmitters in the brain.

Leah writes us Leah's a 55-year-old college instructor from California, and she writes that, "Hormones are at an all time high at our house! Like many mothers of teena, I am going through menopause. I feel absent minded, had low energy, I couldn't make decisions, I could not concentrate on issues at work, and had no patience at home." Leah also wrote that, "I found taking Procera noticeably helped with my short term memory". She goes on to say "Because I felt more organized and in control, my mood improved, my patience deepened. And I credit Procera with helping me get through some really very difficult times". >>Those are some difficult times.

That bill? If so, what happens next? This is "special repor." ???????????? ???????????? 
>> Bret: Good evening. I'm bret baier. Happy new year. Here in washington, the first day of 2013 is looking a lot like the last day of 2019. What started out with hope and optimism for a deal, devol ofed quickly to uncertainty about the way forward. I'm talking about the fiscal cliff bill. We look like at the fiscal cliff, the house republicans are meeting to chart a way forward. The senate passed legislation with overwhelming support this morning. The fiscal cliff legislation. When it made its way across the capitol to the republican controlled house, g.O.P. Lawmakers immediately expressed concern about the lack of spending cuts. With the house majority leader publicly and bluntly stating he does not support the bill and the republicans are still at this time, as you look live behind the doors meeting at this hour, they are planning a vote series at some time. But we don't know when. It may include amending the senate bill and sending it back to the senate. Meantime, house democrats are demanding a straight up-or-down vote on what came over from the senate. The late-breaking developments leaving the automatic spending cuts and tax increases tied to the fiscal cliff still in play right now. In a desperate race against a different clock, we have another free-flowing, fluid situation tonight. Likely a lot of breaking news from capitol hill. We begin with fox team coverage. Chief washington correspondent ed hen looks at the president's next move. Chief congressional correspondent mike emanuel on where this all stands at this moment. We start with mike and I say "at this moment" because it has been every moment changing throughout the day. 
>> That's right. Good evening to you. House republican leaders spent time behind closed doors with the members trying to figure out a way forward. The bombshell announce fire department the house majority announcement today was he does not support the compromise. House republicans are complaining about a deal they did not negotiate about the lack of spending cuts. 

[00:02:19]


>> Consensus that we have to in some ways address spending. People told me, they would rather increase taxes but we need to cut spending. 
>> Part of the problem is it includes $650 billion in tax hike with $15 billion in spending cut and that comes out to $1 in cuts in $41 in taxes. Recognizing there will be trouble attracting support for the bill, vice president joe biden returned to capitol hill again today to encourage house democrats to support the compromise he negotiated. After the meeting, the house democratic leaders pushed for up-and-down vote on the package noting it's after the fiscal cliff deadline. 
>> Taxes will go up on everybody in america if we don't act. Those who are relying on unemployment insurance, million reconciliation relying up on unemployment insurance to support themselves and their families. If we don't act, we will be at risk. 
>> The leader emphasizeed bipartisan support up until now. 
>> A bill passed in the united states senate 89-8. Tell me when you have had that on a measure as controversial as this. 
>> House republicans pushed for quick package arguing it's too late for amendments. 
>> Too late in the game. A point in the deal where it's done, and we keep trying to tinker with it to make it perfect. 
>> The leadership team were not going to be rushed. 
>> They had months to look at that. Now they are expecting to us vote on something that passed hours ago without reading it. I don't think so. 
>> If we don't get the tackrate problem for all americans the economy is going to collapse, stock market will go down and the defense department will become unraveled. We are going to get blamed. So make it better if you can and save the powder for debt ceiling fight. 

[00:04:24]


>> As house republican leadership is considering the way forward, time is an issue. Less than 48 hours from a congress being sworn in. Moments ago, senate democratic leadership aide offered a threat saying that the speaker's office was kept apprised as the deal was going forward. No time to ping-pong offers back and forth. He says essentially if house republicans mess with the deal they got overwhelmingly bipartisan support, they will be responsible for the largest tax hike in american history. Bret? 
>> Bret: We are just getting word that the senate majority leader harry reid adjourned the senate until noon tomorrow. What are the republicans saying about the possibility of amending the bill and what it means for the future of it if they choose to come out of the meeting and put the spending cuts in the bill. What are they saying about what it means? 
>> David dryer head of the house rules committee expressed concern about time being a factor. He expressed concern it could kill the bill and you'd have to start over with a new bill in the 113th congress that starts in less than 48 hours so there is concern about that. Others are saying we were elected to cut spending in washington. We need to do this. The clock is running. Waiting to see what they will do. 
>> Bret:E'LL WATCH IT AND Head back to breaking news with you. What a difference a day makes? Not even a day. They were on their way to pass the legislation to avert the pain of self-imposed fiscal cliff and the trappings for the time being. Tonight a different picture entirely. Ed henry joins us live. What is the mood at the white house? 
>> They are watching and raising like the rest of us. There is no plan, not yet, for president to say anything. They believe with the senate republican leader mitch McCONNELL ON A LIMB, WILL BE Hard for speaker boehner not to pass this. 

[00:06:35]


>> Biden enjoying a casual lunch with the staff. Strolling back to white house saying the physical deal is still on track. 
>> I think so. 
>> Basically air force one is on standby to take them back to hawaii as soon as the house approves the senate plan. Some house republicans say they will disrail it. 
>> If I was worried about a deal struck by president obama and the senate? No. 
>> Democrats incyst it would be exercise in futility that could rattle world markets. 
>> Mercifully, worst congress in history perhaps goes out of existence in two days. If they open this up on the floor and starting to amend, you know, we'll be swearing in the new congress while they are still acting out that drama. 
>> Yet, conservative outrage over the deal is building. Especially after the congressional budget office said legislation that was supposed to help cut the deficit will now add $3.6 trillion to the national debt over the next ten years. The architect of the senate deal minority leader mitch McCONNELL NOTES IT LACKS IN Tax cut for large portion of the public. Rattling it now would likely hand the blame to the republicans. 
>> I can speak to the entire conference when I say we don't think taxes should be going up on anyone. But we all knew if we did nothing they would be going up on everyone today. We weren't going to let that happen. 
>> Aide to the president incyst he was ready to agree to $1.2 trillion in spending cuts. In exchange for equal amount of tax increases during talks with speaker john boehner. Yet, the republican walked away and got most of the tax hikes with virtually no spending cuts in what may be the first shot of the 2016 republican presidential primary, marco rubio became one of eight senators to oppose the deal. And tweeted, "how can barack obama call the proposal a debt reduction pack knowledge it uses tax increase to fund more spending and it increases the debt?" Boehner is getting more cut over the fight over the debt creeling that expires in two months. White house aides think it could backfire, an advisor admitted it would be ugly. Telling fox we're about to enter 60 days of nastiness. I'm told the president has not spoken to speaker boehner since last friday when they had the summit of leaders here at the white house. The significance of that is that boehner made absolutely no promise to the president he is going to pass the legislation. Let alone even bring it up. Bret? 

[00:09:15]


>> Bret: Ed, you know, we talked a little bit about the timeline here. The new congress comes in thursday. At noon. So essentially, this senate bill has an expiration date of thursday at noon. At that point, they have to scrap the effort and start all over again. 
>> That's right. It's essentially the new fiscal cliff, that deadline. Every piece of legislation passed by the house or the senate over the last two years completely expires with this current congress. So you've got to start from scratch. That gives opponents not just on the right, but on the left as well who were not happy with the bill to build opposition, whether it's organized labor or ors or conservatives. That is a huge problem. The president is silent right now, you can guarantee if we move closer to the expiration date, the president will go out here and really engage the public to force the house to consider the bill before it expires, bret? 
>> Bret: Ed henry live on the north lawn. Thank you. We'll go back to breaking news. We heard mike and ed tonight on the legislation and some of the sticking points here. Now white house coapt wendell goler take -- correspondent wendell goler takes a more in-depth look at the bill that passed the senate this morning and is now considered in the house. 
>> The bill as amended is passed. 
>> The senate deal passed with overwhelming bipartisan support, extenting the bush era tax cuts for families making less than $450,000 a year and making the rates permanent. Something that former president bush was unable to do a decade ago because he wasn't able to get two-third of the senate to go along. That part most republicans are happy with. 
>> It makes some things permanent; particularly, in the estate tax area. Permanent fix to the amt. So there are some actual things we do like about it. 
>> The deal seems 30 million people from having to pay the a terptive minimum tax indexing it to inflation. It raises the debtax but has $5 million for individual estate and $10 million family estates like farms. But the payroll tax will go to 6.2%. Inyees to cost the worker making $100,000 a year about $2,000 more. On the spending side, the deal extends the long-term unemployment benefit for another year. Democrats incyst op it. 

[00:11:32]


>> It's critical. We want to talk about the real cliff. It's for the people who are about to lose the unemployment catch sation. If that is not in the deal, that dole is a real problem. 
>> Five-year extension for stimulus tax credit for a terptive energy diversion and another year that businesses can take 50% bonus appreciation op new equipment and buildings. The deal puts off cuts in doctor's medicare payments for another year and formally cancels assisted living entitlement in obamacare that the administration decided was unaffordable anyway. The catch-all measure extent the subsidy to keep the milk prices from spiking. Lack of presidential agreement to cut spending means even if the senate measure passes the house, mr. Obama expect added pressure in weeks when the debt ceiling must be raised again. 
>> We made a mistake to increase the debt limit the first time and gave that guy all that money to buy votes with. We shouldn't make the same mistakes now. 
>> The president says the congress should don't that because it holds the credit rating hostage for partisan demand for spending cut bus the republicans say that is the only way the cuts will ever happen. Bret 
>> Bret: Thank you. The fiscal cliff not the only thing that congress is dealing with. Fox news learned the house plans to split the superstorm sandy aide bill to two parts. Giving the lawmakers opposed to a large bill the ability to vote against it and vote on the other part so they don't appear unwilling to help storm victims. The base would provide immediate funding to those affected by the october storm that devastated new york and new jersey coastlines. Meanwhile, republicans are still meeting up on capitol hill. We have a live camera outside of that meeting. They are, the camera just shooting in and out there. They are meeting and those are the microphones they may come and talk to reporters after they finish that conference meeting. We are just getting word of something that perhaps is happening behind those doors. Senior g.O.P. Leadership aide is telling fox that the speaker presented his members two options. The first would be to make an amendment to the senate bill that would add a package of spending cuts. The whip, majority whip would do a whip check, vote check to see if the spending cut amendment could pass. If they get a commitment of 218 votes on the amendment, they will bring that to the floor and send it back to the senate. The speaker and leader were cautioning about the risk of a strategy. They told them there is no guarantee the senate wouldk on it. They said if we cannot get the commitment of 218 votes tonight, as you look behind that meeting behind the closed doors they said if we cannot get 218 votes tonight we'll bring up the senate pass measure for up-or-down vote in the house. We will see what happens throughout this show coming up. Keep it heren "special repor." 

[00:16:34]


>> Bret: This is a fox news alert. Looking live at the house side of the capitol, where the house g.O.P. Has conference meeting behind the closed doors to plot a way forward. The senate bill is now over there. They a deciding whether they will amend the bill and send it back or have an up-or-down vote in the house, on the fiscal cliff legislation. This is as markets in asia are set to open in 45 minutes. The u.S. Markets tomorrow morning. We will keep an eye on the development on the hill. Checking international headlines now, more than 60 people were killed in the ivory coast when new year's eve celebration turned to panic stampede. Rescue workers iident said it took place over fireworks display and injuried 200 people. The death toll is expected to rise. Gunmen ambush a van killing five female teachers and health workers in pakistan. The teachers were on the way home working from primary school for girls. The attack was a reminder of the risk to women and essential kateors. And aide workers from the islamic militants who opposed their work in that country. There were more than just fireworks lighting up the sky over iran with the new year's. The country has been spending the last few days launching barrage of missile tests in the critical passal way for oil in the world. Correspondent leland vittert with more on what is behind tehran latest saber rattling. 
>> In heavily publicly publicized war games on iran tv, iran knavery proudly showed off -- iran navy showed off the antiship vessels and mines, those to be used to disrupt shipping in the strait of hormuz. Sea channel that cuts between uran and united arab emirates through a fifth of the world's oil flows. 

[00:18:36]


>> No oil will be transported through the strait, threatened the iran deputy head of the commission of foreign affairs. No matter by the tankers or the her chant ships he continued. SINCE THE 1980s, IRAN USED The strait as strategic trump card against u.S. Or western military intact and today made 30 warnings against foreign reconnaissance aircraft and ships monitoring this week's drill in response to the attack comes as they enrich the 20% grade uranium an refusing access to international inspectors at the nuclear facility including those buried deep under ground. At current production, this summer the progress toward the nuclear bomb would reach the redline. Famously drawn on a bomb diagram by the israeli prime minister at last year's united nations meeting. Analysts say benjamin netanyahu drew the line where he felt israeli military strike could still significantly damage iran's nuclear program. Although it's unclear how successful an israeli strike would be given the limit long range bombing capabilities. 
>> Saber rattling is a cam pape topic of prime minister netanyahu, just like ire rainians love the talk about closing strait of hormuz. Many think netanyahu is an attack they wouldn't stand a chance to close the strait against the navy but we are entering another round of high-stakes brinksmanship. Bret? 
>> Bret: Leland vittert in the middle east newsroom. Thank you. Back to the top story, the fiscal cliff legislation. As you look live on capitol hill. This conference meeting is coming to an end. The house g.O.P. Conference meeting. The lawmakers are filing out there. The bells just rang; meaning, that the house session is going to go in to session in about 15 minutes. They will vote on the nonfiscal cliff bills first. Easier way for a head count and also the whiff vote if they are going to vote on the amendment to the bill, or an up-or-down vote on the original senate bill. We will have all of this, plus a live interview on the other side of this break. Keep it here on "special report." ] coughequence?????? #8. baby.

>> Bret: This is a fox news alert. Congressman gomert up there, republican from texas. Listen in for a second. 
>> Unravel the compromise. 
>> It's tough signal in the basement of the house, beneath the house chamber. As you look this meeting, the g.O.P. Conference meeting just breaking up. Getting ready to head to the house floor, but they are going to vote on a number of nonfiscal cliff bills. And the own chad bergram say they're bed check votes to assess if everyone is there, the house members. And who is missing. How many votes the democrats and the republicans need to deliver. Again, we talk about the senate intel in place. It's now sitting for the house to consider. This camera is positioned outside the g.O.P. Conference meeting that just is breaking up, as lawmakers are leaving. The senate bill if they don't choose to amend it. They will do, the republicans will do an up-or-down vote. The question is whether they can get a majority. 218 votes to pass that. To go to the white house and sign in law. Fiscal cliff legislation failed out of the senat 89-8, has hit an iceberg potentially. The house of representatives, concerns about the bill from the conservatives and liberals. Fox business network anchor cheryl casone joins me in new york with a look at how investors here and abroad possibly may react to all of this. Cheryl, happy new year first of all. 
>> Happy new year. 
>> Bret: The markets were closed for the holiday, but what effect will this have potentially when the trading opens back up? 
>> Incredibly negative effect. There are a couple of things happening. We're 35 minutes away from tokyo's market opening. That will give us a first clear indication of what the thought process is around the world about the problems as the roadblock if you will that we have hit in america. An australian trader sending a note out saying if the americans wake up on wednesday they have less money in their paychecks and they are paying more in taxes, there is no deal in washington, it will be a negative kickoff to world markets for the year. Many world markets, in particular in asia, had strong performances. Those performances could be in jeopardy as we begin 2013, the trading year anyway. London is opening around midnight our time. We have a lot to watch here. Invesors do not like what they are seeing. Fun to watch, if you like to watch politics and watch the been aor going back and forth. If you are an investor, you are angry. You don't like what you are seeing. 

[00:26:46]


>> Bret: What about the bill specifically? Are there specific part of the bill that the senate sent to the house investors and wall street don't like? 
>> A few things here that investors are worried about. First off, the tax hike on the wealthy americans, certainly that was expected. Investors knew that when they closed out trading monday evening. The limiting deduction for those making $250,000 or many is a big chunk rate. They make maybe not so great decisions in 2013, whether you buy a stock or a bond. That is an issue. Capital gains taxes. Permanent rise they propose on the senate. 20%. Right there. And then the spending cuts. That is the lack of spending cut. The debt ceiling debate is a mini cliff if you will for many investors and traders. There will be so many more problems coming up in next six months out of washington. The spending is a big issue. S&p downgraded the credit agency of the councilmember. He and other ratings are watching the fight in washington if you will carefully. They will have to look and decide whether or not they want to again re-evaluate the credit rating of the country, that affects the borrowing cost for the u.S. Government, for states, cities. You name it. A lot of unanswered questions here right now. 
>> Bret: Cheryl casone in new york. Cheryl, thank you. We will be watching the markets, especially the asian markets when they open in just 30 minutes. Thank you. The question is now what happens with the u.S. House of representatives? Ho does speaker boehner move forward as the meeting is breaking up? We have inside scoop from behind those closed doors. And perhaps a strategy, path way forward. We have a live interview with the vice chairman of the budget committee. He will join us on the other side of this break. day news starts with arthritis pain and a choice. Take tylenol or take aleve, the #1 recommended pain reliever by orthopedic doctors. Just two aleve can keep pain away all day. Back to the news. 

[00:31:17]


>> Bret: This is a fox news alert. Looking live at the house floor gaveled back in session. Take vote that don't deal with the fiscal cliff legislation and counting heads semily to see where the votes are. For the different options. One is to amend the senate bill and send it back to the senate. The other one is to do a straight up-or-down vote on the senate bill. Joining us now for inside perspective on the g.O.P. Conference meeting that just broke up a few minutes ago. Bring in the republican congressman scott garrett from new jersey. The vice chairman of these budget committee inside that meeting, just got out. Congressman, thank you for joining us. Busy night out there on the hill. What can you tell us about what happened and what the strategy is for republicans going forward? 
>> The house has been put in this situation where because of the lateness of the senate vote as you well know. One or 2:00 in the morning, the senate did their thing. Somebody said in conference nothing good happens at 2:00 in the morning. That is the case here. They sent us over a bill and trying to jam it on the house and leigh town as the senate wants to do. The house is industrying to do the responsible thing, leadership is trying to do the listening thing. Out of conference, the leadership is throwing out a couple of options. You laid out options a moment ago. See if we get to that magic number of 218. 
>> Bret: What is the feeling? When you look around the room and get a sense of the conference meeting there, do you get a sense that there are 218 members who want the amend the bill and send it back? 
>> I wouldn't want to be a whip right now, because i could not tell you walking out of that door there that there were 218 votes this way or that way. Literally why theyave to do the whip on this. To get a sense of people going to the microphone. They are in a conference, raising concerns that we've been raising all along, the fact that the president said a long time ago that you can't cut your way to prosperity. Instead, he wants to tax his way to prosperity. There is a still a strong pushback to that, we can't tax our way and raise taxes. That's what the members are anxious about. 

[00:33:31]


>> Bret: The cbo score for senate bill has the increase, increase of spending each year. With over ten years the national debt, cine esing $4 trillion. 
-- Increasing $4 trillion. You a fiscal conservative. You obviously have a problem with that. Considering the implications of not acting, are you going to vote against the bill this? 
>> You raised your point. I have concern about the increased spending but get an inside look at that. On some of the increase spending is what we call tax expenditure, the tax credit that most republicans would support or have supported in 2001 before I got here. Some of that spending is tax credits, expenditures. 
>> Bret: The big number. Understood. 
>> You got it. On the other side of the equation, the second point of the question is this. Going forward we should not look at a packal which is what the senate spent to us that is going to do what? Raise the taxes, even on the small businesses, allowing that tax expenditures, or rather exemptions for big business to remain in place. That is what the senate has done here. Small business, $450,000 to $1 million is still small business. You will see the taxes go up. Bigger businesses, you will be treated favorably. That is what the president has been pushing all along and why some of us have concerns here. 
>> Bret: That sounds like a no. 
>> I have not been whipped yet soily wait until I go down the room to the hallway. 
>> Bret: Whipped means by the leaders of your party to be able to convince you to vote one or the other. 
>> That is the typical definition of whip. But there is no whipping. kevin McCarthy is doing a poll of the members, not twisting arms, not trying to force votes one way or another. He is literally trying to get a sense of the mood and feel of the congress, of the conference and go in that direction. 
>> Bret: What about the dennis hastert rule? So-called majority. If speaker boehner gets to the point he does not have a majority of the caucus voting for the senate bill, that he would have to pass it with democrats' votes not majority of his own caucus, that he will move forward? 

[00:35:48]


>> That is an excellent question. You bring up a rule that goes back a few years. But in essence, that is what speaker boehner said. He will take the conference now. Either go in one or two directions. One tyrannosaurus rex he may decide to go in, depending on how the vote goes is do -- one direction he may decide to go in, depending on how the vote goes, give democrats for majority vote to pass legislation. Good point. 
>> Bret: Scott garrett from new jersey. Vice chairman of the house committee. We appreciate the time. 
>> Pleasure to be with y. 
>> Bret: We'll follow every development by the hour. 
>> Thank you. 
>> Bret: We're continuing to follow all of it as you look at the house floor. Getting ready for votes. Eventually they will see if the votes include the senate bill. Whether to amend it, send it back. We'll check in with the fox all stars next. flo? is? Are you flo? Yes. Is this the thing you gave my husband? Well, yeah, yes. The "name your price" tool. You tell us the price you want to pay, and we give you a range of options to choose from. Careful, though -- that kind of power can go to your head. At explains a lot. Yo, buddy! I got this. Gimme one, gimme one, gimme one! E power of the "name your price" tool. Only from progressive. 

[00:39:29]


>>> The problem is, we're disappointed that the cuts are not there, that the president promised. That's what we'll go after if we go after anything. 
>> If they open it up to the floor and nothing to amend, we'll be swearing in a new congress. While they are still acting out the drama. 
>> The house must postpone this vote until congress and the american people have time to study and evaluate this extraordinarily complex legislation. 
>> This is all about time. It's about time that we brought this to the floor. 
>> Bret: That is the question. What will happen over the next few hours in the house of representativess? A number of different votes are happening but not the senate legislation of yet. House republican leaders say they will bring that up for a vote. But they also may amend it. Depending on how their members decide if they have enough votes to bring it forward to amend. They don't think there are enough spending cuts in it. They will do that and send it back to the senate. Opens up a whole nother set of questions. Bring in the panel. Steve hayes for "weekly standard." A.B. Stoddard of the hill. Syndicated columnist charles krauthammer. Okay, a.B., We assessed late last night and early in the morning. Your thoughts on what is happening today and what may happen? 
>> We can't be surprised the house republicans didn't like the bill, delay be in a tough situation if they round up 218 votes. 
>> Bret: To amend the deal. I would blow up the whole deal. Then we look at new congress thursday and start from scratch. 
>> Noon thursday the new congress is sworn in and like cinderella the bill will go away. Turns if in to a much kin. 
>> We have eight new democrats in the house. New democrat senators. Who are liberal. Than they were dealing with before. The ratting of the market around the world. Incredibly bully pull pill pressure from president obama. You are hearing two camps, conservatives like lindsey graham saying let's just get it done with. Let's change, vote for a tax cut now. We have gone over the cliff. Just do this. We'll get to spending cut in february when we try to increase the debt ceiling. Democrats want an automatic increase. Others are saying I'm not going to spending for u.I. Insurance. I don't like the patch for unemployment insurance or patch for the sequester. Is no longer a difference on substance. 

[00:42:20]


>> Behind this. Cantor look at the bill, came out and said he was against the bill. He washingtoned in the second conference meeting shoulder to shoulder with john boehner show of solidarity publicly but said he was against the bill because of the spending cuts. Back drama. Thursday is the re-election of speaker boehner and the new congress. 
>> It's possible this is the prelude to a channel thursday. It would be naked to do it. There are conservative in the republican caucus in the house who hate the bill. For good reason. This is a complete surrender on everything. The ratio of tax cut. Or tax hike to spending cut is 40 to 1, rather than 1 to 1 or 1 to 2 or 1 to 3. A complete rout by the democrats. So it's understandable. I think what is likely to happen is that the leadership is going to look to get 218 it could secure to send the bill back to the senate. With equal number of spending cuts. Boehner will have an open vote unwhipped, republicans will vote as they wish. They will probably be enough with all the democrats to pass this. Add one thing. If the republicans vote it down, they to do it at the same time, they have to announce hr-1 introduced thursday. The first bill of the new congress. Which I would say should be exact replica that you pass obama cut, pure tax cut, as we went over the cliff. Do it on income tax, capital gains. You are saying we'll introduce the cut thursday. Clean bill. None of the other stuff in it, like the wind power credit and all of this other stimulus junk. That would be what theteams are demanding. Give it to them on monday. 

[00:44:42]


-- Thursday, it will be a pure tax cut. 
>> By the time you get there, you have a market retook whatever is happening in washington. The asian markets open in 15 minutes. Tomorrow market reacting to the past couple of days. Steve, what about the premise they don't go forward with amending it. They pass it. All democratic votes and 40, 50 republican votes. 
>> That is probably the most likely outcome at this point unless they get to 218. It doesn'tmake sense to do this. The time to have had the fight over the substance in my view was in the past. I don't understand why there wasn't more coordination between the leaders in the house and senate on the republican side to get away from this. If you want to distance yourself, try to get this caines and create the caines a week or two ago and work together in both chambers in order to get the distance, let the democrats own it and walk away. It still would have required a couple dozen votes from the republicans in the house. In order to do that. But now you've got this hybrid situation where you have overwhelmg support in the senate. That makes it more difficult for house republicans and ensures use republicans do what I think is probably smart thing to do on substance but not on taxes which is to vote against the bill. You ensure they get even more of the blame than they would have gotten had you done hit the way two weeks ago. 
>> Bret: A.B., I should point out these are different votes we are looking at, on the screen. They don't deal with a fiscal cliff. Tape freeze, and property. A bunch of votes that don't deal with the big issue we're talking about. Bottom line, does this go through tonight? 
>> I don't think so. Because they, they are going to have 36 hours. They have until 11:59 on thursday. They like the last minute. If they got this far over the cliff they'll keep going a whiling longer. We should say here the democrats don't love the bill. The house democrats all sign on to this. So if the democrats lose some and republicans are scrounging for their 40 to 50 -- 

[00:46:55]


>> Bret: That is the key question today. The house minority whip, steny hoyer would not answer the question how will votes will you bring to the table? How will democrats will you bring to the table if it's an up-or-down vote? That is a big question, too. 
>> If the president is behind it and the democratic controlled senate is behind it, I can't -- maybe a few left wing democrats, but you have the minority leader in the house supporting it. Leadership supporting it strongly. I can't see the democrats losing more than a dozen of their caucus on the vote. They are going to get a huge number. It won't get a lot of republicans in the path. 
>> Okay. We are following every minute. As it happens. Up on capitol hill. We'll keep you updated here on the fox news channel. Next up, new year's day. 2013. We thought we'd do resolutions for folks on both sides of the aisle here in washington. ?????? ?????? 
[ slap! ] 
[ slap! slap! slap! slap! ] OW! OW! 
[ Male Announcer ] YOUR FAVORITE FOODS FIGHTING You? Fight back fast with tums. Calcium-rich tums starts working so fast you'll forget you had heartburn. ?????? Tum tum tum tum tums ?????? 

[00:51:13]


>> Bret: It is a new year. And it's of course time to get all the resolutions in full gear. 2013 is here. We're back with the panel. We wanted to ask for resolutions for maybe both parties here in washington, for the year of 2013. Steve? 
>> I would think for republicans, the resolution should be to discipline themselves to see evening through the prism of 2014. And 2016. And in the context of the current discussions and congressional republicans that would mean don't go for the short-term hit or what feels good. Look at the longer term hit. Serious consequences and problems implementing obamacare. There are longer terrell thing that add up to benefit of republicans if they don't shoot themselveses in the foot for the short-term. Try not to demagogue opponents at every step on every issue. 
>> Bret: A.B.? 
>> I think that the republicans, think about the next two elections and the coition will to put together to be majority g.O.P.Ing party a win back the white house. To that end they need to get out in front of the immigration and the gun control debate. We might stay on the cliff all year and never get to the two debates. The point if they want to win over more voters in the groups, the democrats won so well in november, they are going to need to start to shift on the issue, show the electorate they are listening and really change and be flexible. Instead of say nothing come up with the own proposal like senator rubio was trying to do with the dream act this year. I think that would be the best thing for them. Especially since this continued life on the cliff is making them look worse and worse. For the democrats, life on the cliff not yet exposed the division in that party over the refusal to rein in entitlement spending and the denial about it. 
>> Bret: Although, do you believe there are more and more articles and columns that deal with the, you know, the charges of failed presidential leadership as opposed to congressial -- 

[00:53:17]


>> I think president obama deserves credit in july of 2011 and last month with boehner in negotiations lunching forward on the medicare reform that his party is divided over, not united behind. It's time for him to push his party to get behind them or we are going to have a forcing of that. 
>> Bret: Charles? 
>> House republicans, when you go in to negotiations with obama, you will be asked to give up your sword and your shirt. Leave the room make sure you have your trousers. Looking at the bill from the senate, they were trouserless. This has not been a good negotiating session. Obama every morning he needs to wake up and try to go with before the fall. You won the election. You know it. The republicans know it. And you are entitled to certain things. But if you repeat what you did on monday which was a victory lap in the cusp of the conclusion of negotiations where you rub the republicans' nose in the fact that you force them to raise the rates and then you say you think you have spending afterwards, you are not going to get any spending cuts afterwards. He is oaf his own cliff. What he needs to remember is one day he will need the republicans, to be a run on the dollar or crisis in foreign affairs, he has to make sure that he hasn't so humiliated and alienated them that they will not stand with him. He is the president of the country. He has to remember that, not just the miles per hour liberals or the american democrats. 
>> Bret: Do you think there is regret that speaker boehner didn't take whatever the big deal offer was from president obama and the white house in this situation? That he instead, you know, went to plan "b" scenario and kind of went his own way? 
>> No, I don't. I think for the republicans that was equally losing proposition. It would have pretended to set the bargain on very bad terms. Best to give away what you have to give away today and then to fight onrounds the republican are stronger and the debt ceiling and the continueed resolution coming up in a few months. 

[00:55:32]


>> Bret: Agree? 
>> Well, charles -- that is interesting. I thought charles thought this bill was a disaster and they shouldn't. You think they should move it -- 
>> it's -- I think at the last minute they will improve it. I think they should kill it. At the same time, announce hr-1 for thursday afternoon. And tell the nation and the markets that tax cut will be there by 3:00. Thursday afternoon. 
>> Bret: Last word. 
>> No. I think the grand bargain was good for -- I don't think it was good for them then and i don't think it's good for them now. 
>> Bret: My resolution for both parties avoid scheduling the next legislative standoff arou a holiday. Maybe just midweek, sometimes. That is it for the panel. Stay tupeed for latest news on the fiscal cliff as we come to the end of this show, but we will be covering it all night long. ?????? ??????

Representative john fleming are louisiana walked through saying there will be a vote one way or the other. Possibly to amend the bill, possibly an up or down.

=======================================================

600 billion in revenues over the next ten years. How things are sized up overnight. 
>> I've said all along, our most important priority is protecting middle class families. This legislation does this. 
>> This shouldn't be the model of how we do things around here. But I think we can sigh we've done some good for the country. 
>> If it passes the house, here is what the plan means for you and your family. Bush era tax cuts would stay in place for individuals earning less than $400,000 a year and couples earning less than $450,000. Unemployment benefits for 2 million americans would be extended for a year, and the alternative minimum tax would permanently be adjusted for inflation. But when it comes to spending cuts, lawmakers defer for two more months. That's a nice way of saying kicking the can down the road. Expect more finger pointing and fighting in 2013. Ite house correspondent brianna keilar up all night. Joining us to talk about what's going phone in washington, in the white house. This is a wild card. We know they will take it up, but we don't know what it means. 
>> It does get tricky. Some house republicans have been the ones that said throughout the whole process, we don't want to move forward on certain things. Granted, now we've gone over the cliff. Tax hikes, technically are in effect. So any vote in the house will be a vote for tax cuts, not for tax hikes. That helps. John boehner needs to take this deal struck in the senate that presumably has some buy in from him if not from his rank and FILE, BECAUSE mitch McConnell did not negotiate this is a vacuum and this is a pretty overwe will being vote. He will take this to his conference today and see where they are at. The pectation is there are two directions this could go. Either a vote on the bill or house republicans propose changes so they can amend the bill more to their liking and send it back to the senate. But I think this is expected to move along here. 

[00:02:08]


>> There could be amendments, one past, they could vote on amendments, could fail, and then vote on the full measure. Isn't that true also? 
>> Yeah, that is true, and the other thing is once anything goes to the floor, it's not just up to republicans, it will -- and the think the expectation all along, whatever ultimately passes the house as we saw in the senate will require democrats and republicans. 
>> Talking to phil gingery, seemed to be leaning no on this. Bmr. Boehner doesn't need all of the votes. 
>> And even though it seems like senator gingery is probably leaning no, many republicans are leaning no, but not necessarily saying this is -- this is a deal that should not go through. In a way, they may vote no, but they also sort of acquiesce to see the need going forward. 
>> Brianna keilar inwashington, thank you very much. 
>>> All right. Let's break down some of what's in the deal. We've been telling you about the so-called dairy cliff. In addition to dealing wi the fiscal crisis, the senate deal would extend federal farm policies through september. That means milk prices, milk prices will not double. The deal also knicks a set pay raisfor congress. The white house looks to raise tax rates from 35% to 40 pest, but republicans successfully insist that the exemption should be adjusted annually for inflation and increase the exemption for 7.5 million for families. The rates on dividendeds and capital gains ride to 20%. For taxpayers earning less than 450,000, it would restore exemptions and personalized deductions. Those benefits phasing out for couples earning more than $250,000 a year. Single people, more than $200,000. It calls for a permanent fix for the alternativ minimum tax, otherwise, we saw many pay their 2012 returns. It would extend tax credits for college tuition and the working poor. 

[00:04:42]


>> The amt were important, it was really going to kick that number up. 
>> That was another yearly crisis. Rich people make sure they made more taxes. 
>> Didn't work out. 
>>> To capitol hill, jonathan allen is the congressional correspondent for litico. Did you sleep there last night? I didn't sleep in the capitol, no. I make a rule not to do that. Once you start, it's a slippery slope. 
>> There may be some people, like phil gingery from georgia, who will vote no is that the same as a conservative movement, or for that matter, a liberal movement on the democratic side to defeat the bill that they will face in the house today? 
>> I think brianna said is right, the term acquiesce, and on the right and the left, i think they wquiesce. Some voices will come out and say it's a bad idea. Tom harkin, democratic senator from iowa, one of them. He torched this whole plan. It's interesting. When it comes down to the last minutes here, how much less energy and vigor some of the no voters have, they -- they would like to at least be able to go home for a day before the new CONGRESS STARTS ON JANUARY 3rd. 
>> They want to tell constituents, I wasn't all that into this but that had nothing to do with me. Here is the problem, as we get further and further. This could have amendments and setbacks, does that give energy to interest groups who started last night? Politicking and lobbying both senators and congressmen to say this is a bad deal that gives too much to the other side. 

[00:06:50]


>> Sure this gives an opportunity for opponents to make arguments this is a bad deal. This legislation not available to anybody publicly when the senate voted it on last night. There were early returns from heritage action group telling folks to vote no on it if they could, but basically this is the opportunity the no crowd will have over the next 12 hours, 24 hours to make their arguments. This is the way congress does business in the dark of night without any transparency to what they are doing, and I think ultimately, that's one of the reasons the american public has such little faith. 
>> You can't blame them, jonathan, they only had 517 days to work this out at some point it will take to you the middle of the night. Good to see you as always. Continue that habit of not sleeping in congress. Jonathan allen joining us at the capitol. 
>> I say that about cnn. 
>> I've done it. In that room once and it is hard. 
>> He didn't lose it for 2013, the gripping sar chism. 
>>> Football, not the only game in town. Stay with cnn all day for all of the developments, house back in session at noon this is not over yet. Could be a lot more. 
>> Very compelling. Totally not watching football today. 
>> Don't watch football, watch us. 
>>> In other news, hillary clinton's doctors revealing details about the blood clot that handlaned her in the hospital. Doctors say mrs. Clinton did not have a stroke or suffer any neurological damage, they also say they are confident that the second of state will make a full recovery. Cnn's jill dougherty is live at the state department this morning. What is the latest on the secretary's condition? 
>> The latest is as the secretary is in that new york hospital, she's being treated with blood thinners, that's the main thing. They have to get blood thinners as they say treated properly so they give her enough, not too much, and be able to be released. It won't happen until they do that. It's really a turnabout. I was sitting here in a quiet state department this morning. It's a ho very few people around, and thinking how things have really changed this is a secretary who has traveled a million miles. She's traveled to more than 100 countries and here in the waning days, we have a few weeks before the end of this administration, this part of the administration, and, you know, she's in the hospital. Quite striking. Good they are saying that she is talking with her doctors, talking with her family. And they expect her to milwaukee a full rery. But in a broader sense, it's really quite amazing what has happened at th end of a very vigorous, vigorous position of hillary clinton as secretary of state. 

[00:09:46]


>> Such an interesting juxtaposition, after such an eventful for years in the position, the end is fairly quiet. We're all -- thoughts with mrs. Clinton as she recovers and doctors expect her to make full and complete recovery. Thank you. 
>>> Amid secretary clinton's illness and the fiscal cliff, americans rang in the new year in spectacular style. 1 million in times square welcomed in 2013. And in lean, the georgia peach was lowered as the new year arrived there. In las vegas, where everything is big and over the top, it was an amazing fireworks display over the vegas strip. Just in case anyone missed the point that it was 2013, the fireworks telling them that it had officially begun. Very cool. 
>> They think big there. 
>> They know how to throw a party time to time. 
>>> Two planes damaged in forth lauderdale, florida. There was a gash in the tail section of the united plane, no fuel leak from either aircraft, and luckily no injuries rorpted refer. 
>> Off the coast of alaska, coast guard and tugboat crews are trying to pull an oil rig into safe waters. Lines were reattached, bu 60-mile-an-hour wind and 28-foot high waves in the forecast for today. Officials fear a fuel spill if that rig is grounded. 
>>> And those were wedding bells nging in the stroke of midnight in maryland. That's when same-sex marriage became legal there. Voters approved the new law in november. Seven couples got hitched at 12:01 a.M. With mayor stephanie rawlins blake presiding. 

[00:11:47]


>>> Ahead on "starting point," how the house handles the deal won't just affect us, it could take an effect on the global economy. Richard quest, breaks it down next. 
>> And elijah cummings joins us live. Does he see the fiscal cliff afwremt getting through the house? And we leave you with london's new year's celebration. There it is. You're watching starting point. Happy new year. lisa, quit. I honestly loved smoking, and I honestly didn't think I would ever quit. 
[ Male Announcer ] ALONG WITH SUPPORT, Chantix is proven to help people quit smoking. It reduces the urge to smoke. It put me at ease that you could smoke on the first week. 
[ Male Announcer ] SOME PEOPLE HAD CHANGES In behavior, thinking or mood, hostility, agitation, depressed mood and suicidal thoughts or actions while taking or after stopping chantix. If you notice any of these stop taking chantix and call your doctor right away. Tell your doctor about any history of depression or other mental health problems, which could get worse while taking chantix. Don't take chantix if you've had a serious allergic or skin reaction to it. If you develop these stop taking chantix and see your doctor right away as some can be life-threatening. If you have a history of heart or blood vessel problems, tell your doctor if you have new or worse symptoms. Get medical help right away if you have symptoms of a heart attack. Use caution when driving or operating machinery. Common side effects include nausea, trouble sleeping and unusual dreams. With chantix and with the support system it worked. It worked for me. 
[ Male Announcer ] ASK YOUR DOCTOR IF CHANTIX Is right for you. Excuse me, sir I'm gonna have to ask you to power down your little word game. I think your friends will understand. Oh no, it's actually my GEICO app...see? ...I just uh paid my bill. Did you really? From the plane? Yeah, I can manage my policy, get roadside assistance, pretty much access GEICO 24/7. Sounds a little too good to be true sir. I'll believe that when pigs fly. OK, did she seriously just say that? GEICO. Just click away with our free mobile app. 

[00:14:54]


>>> We have not entirely averted the fiscal cliff, but the senate has passed a deal to do its part to help going over the cliff. Now it's up to the house of representatives which has ait of a reputation for being intransigent. They could take action today, we hope they take action today. World markets, although closed for new year's day will be watching. And investors will be watching anxiously. They will react when they open, and that will start about 8:00 p.M. Eastern tonight, the fist of asia's markets open up. Cnn's richard quest joins us from on. Good morning, richard. Your perspective on everything that's happened in the last 1 hours? 
>> Well, I have it here, all six pages and that's just the title section of the american taxpayer relief act of 2012. The so-called fiscal cliff. Do you know there is nearly 100 sections, just dealing with the extensions and the relief and provisions. Goes to many, many pages, but the crucial point is as far as the world markets are concerned, this is just borrowed time. The bulk of the 600 billion in tax rises has been put to one side. You were talking a few moments ago, you have still got, it has to get through the house, senate, and signed and the two months on the spending cuts, and the debt ceiling, you've got the appropriations and reconciliation. The markets will finally say -- 
>> my remarkable expertise are you have seen this game play out. You watched this movie before, seen it before. And you have a deadline for a big deal and what you end up is a puny deal. 
>> You end up with -- I wouldn't use the phrase puny deal. I would use fudge. What have you here is a fiscal fudge. They have done the barest necessary to get over -- let's stick with the cliff analogy. You walk toward the cliff, and all they have really done severe off to the side. The cliff is still there, now thuy just aren't as close to the pre precipice. We saw it with greece, we saw it with the fiscal come basket. They love this word fiscal every time they want to do a deal. We've seen it again and again, and the warning from the market. Won't come this week I won't believe. Looking at mid to late january, early february. Debt ceiling. The debt ceiling is the one to keep your eye on. 

[00:17:41]


>> Senator rand paul, the son of ron paul, on tv last night making some comment about debt we carry in the united states. Absolute debt per person being greater than absolute debt per person than greece and that's why the united states was going to become greece. I was so incensed that I lost the little hair I had left on my head. The united states will never not be able to pay its bills and meet obligations, because the united states has a remarkable printing press for money. 
>> Absolutely. A remarkable printing press for money. A multitrillion dollar economy, a vibrancy and flexibility of the workforce. A single language. All sorts of structural and systemic reasons why it will grow. And I mean, hallelujah, the u.S. Growing 2% to 3% is th savior for the rest of the world. 
>> Unbelievable. 
>> It is extraordinary, but growing despite the -- the american taxpayer relief act of 2013. Which I promise you, is so detailed and so many -- i suppose the best way is to say time bombs and landmines in it, in the budget pages. 
>> I am glad you have at least read the preamble to the bill. I hope they have. They have until noon eastern. Richard quest talking to us from london, I'll talk to you many times through the cour the day. 
>> They always make it sown like they are doing us a favor. America, we'll help and give you this relief. 
>> It doesn't sound like richard quest is a yes vote on this deal? Not much of an endorsement. He doesn't actually get a vote. We'll talk to someone who does. Congressman elijah cummings from maryland. Ranking democrat on the house oversight committee. Thought we would have a nice discussion about where things are headed. Right off the bat, are you a yes vote on this deal? 
>> I'm leaning yes. You look at the fact that the senate voted 89-8, only three democratic senators voting against the bill, I mean, automatically you start with the presumption that you need to look from a positive standpoint. One of the things I emphasized over and over again. Politics about the business of compromise. I don't necessarily like everything in this piece of legislation, but certainly our caucus will be meeting, and we'll be going through it and determining exactly when it says, but from what I've seen preliminarily. 

[00:20:27]


>> A lot of seen from cossmen who don't like it. Congressman tom harkin from iowa said no deal is better than a bad deal. He voted against it. "The new york times" says it weakens president obama's hand going forward and may hurt him in the debt ceiling negotiations. He has ruled out any negotiations over the debt ceiling and on monday he vowed that revenue increases must match further spending cuts. But as this deal shows, he often compromises at the last minute. That's the important part. Let's leave it there. Has president obama showed when his back support against the wall, he will cave? 
>> The president has been very strong in these negotiations. You have to keep in mind the republicans really did not want to tax more wealthy people in our society one dime. Not a dime, and he's stuck with that. I consider myself a liberal and proud of it. We did not want an increase in the age with regard to medicaid and cpi with regard to social security benefits. And the president was strong there, and I think he'll continue to be strong, and, you know, I notice a different president since he won this election, I think he is working very closely with congress, and, again, I -- often I'm -- I'm critical for congress for not coming to the table and compromising. Critical for trends for saying my way or thehighway. But at some point, we've got to take care of a lot of people like folks in my district, who through this deal will at least be able to get unemployment benefits, and a number of others that mean something to middle class families. 

[00:22:31]


>> Are we setting up ourselves for fight after fight on budget issues in this country? I don't feel like we've fixed the problems with the process. I'm real worried about two years, three years, ten years of fiscal cliffs because we have huge debts, huge deficits. 
>> Christine, you asked the perfect question. That's my worry. And we've got the debt ceiling debate coming up in about two months, and that was something at one time, and subpoenaing a lot of time is you did get it. At some time we have to change our politics in washington. One of the good things about getting this done, although we may not like it, at least it says to the american people they put their heads together and able to resolve something. 
-Hoping we won't allow politics to take overpolicy and it seems that's what happened. 
>> Good luck with that sir. We know you will face this three more times in the next three months. Thank you for coming on this morning, we should say happy new year to you, cohenman.

>>> all right. Welcome back, everyone. Happy new year and this breaking news. The economy and your take home pay are in the hands of the use of representatives right now. Happy new year, everyone. Earlier this morning, the senate passed a plan to fend off the fiscal cliff. The deal was crafted by vice president joe biden and the senate minority leader mitch McCONNELL. The senate vote was overwhelming, 89-8. That say big vote these days. Anrepublican controlled house left well before midnight, they have to take up the matter today. 
>> Our most important priority is protecting middle class families. This legislation does that. 
>> This shouldn't be the model for how we do things around here, but I think we've done some good for the country. 
>> This is what the deal means for you and your family. Bush era tax cuts extended for individuals earning less than $400,000 a year, and couples earning less than $450,000. Unemployment benefits extended for a year for 2 million americans and a permanent adjustment for inflation, for the alternative minimum tax. A pretty big deal. Wondering about spending cuts, keep wondering, lawmakers deferred. They will fight over those cuts over the next two months, probably again and again and again. Despite the progress overnight in the senate, it appears the drawn-out fiscal cliff fiasco has the american people permanently fed up. 
>> U.S. A shame that we've elected these officials and they can't do their job, and they blame each other or the other sides when it's the american people that are suffering. 
>> Think we have a broken system. I think that's what the problem is now, everyone trying to please different groups rather than try to do what's best for the country. 
>> U.S. Not a republican thing or democratic thing at some point. It becomes the question of are the people we've elected to do a job doing the job we elected them to do. Frankly, I don't think so. 

[00:32:22]


>> Pretty popular sentiment right now. Brianna keilar joins us live from washington. The house is a wild card here. They say they will take this up, open up at 12:00. How is this likely to play out? 
>> One of two ways, john this could play out. Either house speaker john boehner takes this senate bill before his conference and after talking to them feels he has enough support to put it on the floor and vote for it in its entirety, or perhaps some house republicans say there are things in here we don't like. We want to change some of the things, make them more to our liking. Let's amend them or try to am them, and we'll second send whatever it is over to the senate. Presumably because, one, this vote was huge in the senate. 89-8, not the kind of vote you see very often and mitch McCONNELL, HE HAS A SENSE Certainly of where speaker boehner is. He isn't going to broker a deal that he didn't think would be able to get through the house of representatives. The obvious thing here, this will require democratic and republican votes, that's the expectation, and we don't know wherefore house speaker john boehner that threshold is. He wants as much support from republicans as possible and we'll see today how much he has I think. 
>> We've been talking to democrats and approximate republicans, members of congress. Democrats tell us they are pretty much going to vote for this republicans seem to be leaning no. But the speaker doesn't need every republican. Really needs about 30. 
>> No, he doesn't. But I think he wants more than just 30. The other thing that makes this deal more palatable is that now e tax hikes have kicked in. They have gone in automatically and voting for tax cuts. That really does help. Actually going over the fiscal cliff will help some republicans vote for a measure when maybe before they would have voted against it. Some republicans up even though they are not on board, won't vote for this unless they have to. But I think john boehner wants more than 30 republicans to be on board with him. 

[00:34:31]


>> No doubt the case. Brianna keilar in washington. Looking for signs all morning about how this will go down. Any smoke rising from the speaker's office, we know are you watching. 
>> Let's dive into the senate deal. What it does on the business side. Popular tax breaks extended, including a credit for research, which benefits high-tech companies and appear an investment rightoff that helps manufacturers. The long-term unemployed receives emergency benefits for another year. Doctors spared a 27% cut in medicare reimbursements set to take effect in january. Th0 billion cost would be cut by cutting other health care programs. 
>> And tim huelkamp, you and i got into a little dustup last night. Brand new year, 2013. Let's start over again. Happy new year to you, sir. 
>> Happy new year to you as well. It's a pleasure to be here as well. 
>> I don't want to deprive our viewers of the remarkable fun and heat. Let's play that back. 
>> It will put people out of work with the 2% that are going to pay higher taxes, we believe that will impact maybe a million small businesses and raise their taxes. 
>> You are saying more than a million businesses will be affected if the threshold is $450,000? You want to stick with that information or check that information? 
>> That's our best gues. 
>> I think that's a guess, congressman. 
>> Can I answer the question? 
>> Go ahead. 
>> We have numbers, montana state university is I believe the source. You impacted 311,000 small businesses will be impacted by the tax increase. At the $250,000 level, it's over 2 million small businesses. 
>> All right. Your staff kindly sent me a whole lot of information to me last night. Read through the montana state university report, and we have our own research. I think we have a general disagreement about the numbers. According to your own republican sources, that $250,000, the lower level, 940,000 businesses would have been affected in total. Maybe 750,000 at $450,000. I think the montana university numbers are off. But let's agree to a number. We'll disagree about our sources. They are not all job-creating businesses. A lot of "s" corporations that run income through their personal accounts are one offs, celebrities, guys like me who write books and have a company and employ absolutely nobody. These are not where most jobs in america actually come from. So the connection -- the issue i was having with our discussion, the connection between raising taxes and costing jobs. 

[00:37:28]


>> And what is your point? We disagree on the numbers, but -- 
>> all sorts of studies suggest -- it's just not going to cost that many jobs. Your implication it was going to cost 1 million jobs. 
>> I talk to business owners in my district, and I haven't found one that says raise my taxes, congressman and we'll hire more people. 
>> I think businesses hire people when they have demand for business. 
>> Not when their cost goes up. When they have to send more money to washington. We have increases in business taxes and millions of american households, lower and middle income that will pay higher taxes this year than last year, but this deal includes higher taxes, definitely does, this deal will increase spending and it does nothing for fundamental overspending problem and lack of entitlement reform, and three strikes, looks like what is in the bill for my view. I don't know if it will pass the house. We'll find out later today. 
>> Iespective of tax rates, if you are a bakery and selling moread, you will hire more staff. You might. Obama care, a bulk of those taxes kicked in. I don't want to hire number 51, employee number 51 because of obama care kicking in. In a normal world that would happen, but with obama care, i would say we'll see what happens. 
>> Employer 51 is actually an issue, you and I agree on. Let me ask you about the bill. What -- from what you have seen of it so far, yes vote or no vote? 
>> I'm a no vote, but until we see the details, we're reading reports, I will say most folks might resume a member of congress has those details. We're reading media reports, nothing on websites out there. It locks like a no. Looks like typical insider deal for washington, d.C., Where they getly 89 votes in the senate, but at the end of the day, our debt will get bigger, spending will go up. Taxes will increase, and americans will continue to be very upset at washington. 

[00:39:39]


>> Some sense -- I've been asking colleagues this morning. You have sense if you get past the tax stuff, the politicized part of the discussion, you can correct some attention to spending and entitlement cuts? 
>> I'm not very hopeful or optimistic on that at all. But with the coming of the real debt ceiling, perhaps in late february, early march, we'll have a real debate about it, but if you look back 17 months ago, washington came to a deal, and as a result, they said they would cut spending. The spending they promised to cut 17 months ago is the spending cuts that are undoing with this deal. So I'm pessimistic about the chances of actually getting fundamental entitlement reform and cutting the budge nets washington, d.C. 
>> You're not making a full commitment, so you don't know if you will vote for it. Probably leaning against it. What do you think will happen? You think it will pass the house? 
>> I don't know. There used to be something called the hastert rule where nothing comes to the floor unless it has a majority of the republican conference. I'm presuming we'll have a long debate behind closed doors with republicans, everything I know about it, three strikes in my book and I'll vote no on this bill. 
>> Congressman, thank you. We appreciate it best for the new year. 
>> You too, thank you so much. 
>>> Other news going on this morning. Top stories happening right now. Civil rights activists known as the wilmington ten have been pardoned. Nine african-american men and one woman were convicted of firebombing a grocery store in 1972. Convicts were over turned in 1980. But now the governor saying that their convictions were tainted by naked racism. 
>>> Ben affleck's story about how there was a reduce by the cia and canadian government to get hostages released. Now a canadian who played a critical role in the real-life drama has died. 

[00:41:45]


>>> Call it blackmon in the nfl. Lovie smith, one of the seven coach who's got fired after the regular season. 10-6 record. Led the bears to the super bowl in 2006. Other coaches getting the ax. Romio crennel, chan gaily, ken whisenhunt. And andy reid. Pat shurmur and norv turner. Five general managers also got the ax. A tough day in the national football league. 
>>> Something to watch during today's 104th tournament of roses parade. For the first time ever, the defense department has a float, a replica of the korean war veterans memorial in washington, d.C. 
>> Is there something significant about the first day of the year? 
>> The season ended the day before. Finished all their games. As soon as games are over, they fire everyone, clear house. The reason you fire so many coaches, in nfl, so much parreded onny. They have the same levels of talent and people think coaches make a big, big difference and now a lot of them looking for work. 
>> I'll say. 
>>> It wouldn't be new year's around here without anderson cooper and kathy griffin. They rang in 2013. 
>> Rihanna will be here. 
>> Someone on twitter said that there is a drinking game every time I giggle nervously.

>> Just like your new year's eve party, wasn't it? 

[00:43:49]


>> Last time I saw it, with kathy griffin -- 
>> sectioning david gergen. 
>> I guess that was the other hour's version. Now we know secretary of state hillary clinton's blood clot found in her head, we'll look how serious this is with our president practicing our resident practicing neurosurgeon, dr. Sanjay gupta. 
>> I'll try to get us back on track with honey boo-boo. Big newmakers in 2012. Who shall we watch in 2013? That's ahead. We'll leave you with dubai as dubai rang in the new year. That's right. Wow. That's pretty impressive.

>>> Welcome back to "early start" -- or "starting point." Hilary clinton spent new year's eve in a new york city hospital. Treated for a blood clot in her head. We asked dr. Sanjay gupta about her condition. 
>> We have some of the details about what precisely happened to secretary of state clinton and the specific blood clot. The blood clot we're talking about now, unclear where it was located previously. But we know it's in one of the blood vessels around the brain. Not, again, on the brain. Pushing on the brain in any way, but it's a blood vessel that actually drains blood away from the brain. A cerebral vain. I want to show you here. We know in secretary of state clinton's case it's on the ght side of her head, the right transverse sign us. I'll show you the left side for sake of demonstration here. If I remove the hemisphere of the brain here, you can actually see where the veins are, the blue area right there, that is the area that is draining blood away from the brain and one of the vains in this area, that's where the clot actually has occurred. Most likely due to a combination of the head trauma that she had a few weeks ago in addition to the fact that she has had a problem with blood clots in the past, dating back to 199 8. Her doctors say she is awake, talking. No evidence of stroke or neurological damage. My guess is they will continue to monitor her for a couple of days in the hospital and probably get another scan at some point to make sure the clot has dissolved as a result of blood thinner medications. As we get more details, we'll bring them back to you. 

[00:49:19]


>> Thank you, sanjay. Hilary clinton's doctors do expect her to make a full and complete recovery. 
>>> Ahead on "starting point," hillary clinton expected to step down off secretary of state. Don't take your eyes off of her. Why she's one to watch in 2013. Along with jeb bush and michelle obama we'll explain why, next. You're watching "starting point." We can see you Carl. We can totally see you. Come on you're better than this...all that prowling around. Yeah, you're the king of the jungle. Have you thought about going vegan Carl? Hahaha!! You know folks who save hundreds of dollars by switching to GEICO sure are happy. How happy are they Jimmy? Happier than antelope with night-vision goggles. Nice! Get happy. Get GEICO. Fifteen minutes could save you fifteen percent or more. clean toothpaste. But they have to use special care in keeping the denture clean. Dentures are very different to real teeth. They're about 10 times softer and may have surface pores where bacteria can multiply. Polident is designed to clean dentures daily. Its unique micro-clean formula kills 99.9% of odor causing bacteria and helps dissolve stains, cleaning in a better way than brushing with toothpaste. That's why I recommend using polident.

[00:52:27]


>>> So what got us talking in 2012 and what is on the radar for 2013? We're there already, my goodness. Cnn contributor and republican strategist anna navarro joins us from miami and hillary rosen is here in new york to talk about the newsmakers of 2012 plus their big predictions on 2013. Let me ask you off the bat about 2012. We'll dispense with that fast. Biggest person in 2012. 
>> For me, I'm a political consultant so for me the political story of the year is the silent one, the campaign geeks have taken over politics, election analytics are really so important to why barack obama won, you know that hidden group of guys they hired and women that spent a year behind their laptops at campaign headquarters in chicago made the difference showing where to pull out the vote, huge different for the president. 
>> Anna? 
>> I agree with hillary and told my republican counterparts we need more geeks. We need less nerds and more geeks. Less pocketotectors and more piercings and facial hair. I think for me one of the biggest newsmakers was mulalah yousef who was shot by the taliban and recovering. She shows perseverance, gives me hope as a woman. She's an example of young girls all over the world and the most inspirational story and this entire year is this young girl not to frayed to talk, to raise her voice on behalf of freedom for other women and stand up for her rights and fight for her life. 
>> Where do you stand on honey boo boo? 
>> I love honey boo boo. I am confess I am in the anderson cooper fan of honey boo boo clan. It makes fun of reality shows. It makes fun of the people, but you know what? They're laughing all the way to the bank and I just think she's terrific, you know, she's done it all. She's done a great thing for rednecks, she's become the redneck child star pageant queen. I love honey boo boo, child. 

[00:54:54]


>> I can't go there with honey boo boo, sorry, anna. 
>> In 2013 a honey boo booless year but what does 2013 hold do you think? 
>> There's a couple big things on the radar that I see. First of all when we look at the transition for the last year over whahappened for same-sex marriage, an issue important to so many people including me obviously the fact that we won important referendums and that the president of the united states came out in favor of same-sex marriage, the supreme court is going to rule next year on this issue. This is going to be life-changing for so many people. That's huge. The other person to watch i think is michelle obama coming out of the campaign, you know, it's well-known she doesn't particularly like to, you know, the political rough and tumble of a campaign. Now she doesn't have to worry about re-election. This is her year to shine. 
>> She's free. 
>> She's freed up a little and I'm excited to do what she'll do with the newfound freedom. 
>> We always talk about second terms for presidents but for the first spouses they're not running for anything unless you're hillary clinton. 
>> Modern first spouse. Things are different over the past two or three presidencys from the historical perspective of a first lady. She'omeone who has a chance to make a difference. 
>> She's clear she's not a political candidate like hillary clinton thought she might be but not going to be quiet like laura bush was. She has a lot to offer and talk about. 
>> She's also very young, you know, she still has a lot to do and next chapters in her life. 
>> As are you, anna navarro in miami, happy new year to you and hillary. 
>>> The senate passing the bill to fend off the fiscal cliff. Will the house follow suit? We'll ask sheila bair if it's the right deal for the country and secretary of state hillary clinton is hospitalized with a blood clot near her brain. What her doctors are saying about her prognosis. What's that in reindeer-power?

>>> Our "starting point," a new year and a new agreement on the fiscal cliff. 
>> The bill as amended is passed. 
>> Just hours ago the senate reaches a deal to avoid major tax hikes and spending cuts after some serious back and forth on capitol hill. 
>> I'm interested in getting a result here. 
>> I'm disappointed that we weren't able to make the grand bargain as we tried to do for so long but we tried. 
>> No deal is better than a bad deal and this looks like a very bad deal. 
>> With the deal now headed to the house floor for a vote, will it survive? This morning, what's in this agreement and what it means for you and your taxes. Happy new year, I'm john berman. Soledad o'brien is off today. 
>> Good morning I'm christine romans. 
>> And I'm ali velshi. IT IS TUESDAY, 1st, A Special fiscal cliff edition of "starting point" begins right now. 
>>> Our starting point in the special fiscal cliff edition of "starting point" is breaking news, a fiscal cliff deal struck in the senate overnight. Now our paycheck and the u.S. Economy are in the hands of the house of representatives. This is the latest, a bill crafted by vice president joe biden and minority leader mitch McCONNELL PASSED 89-6 MARGIN Just after 2:00 in the morning. The republican controlled house has agreed to consider it later in the morning but it is anyone's guess how that will go. If the house votes yes the measure would generate about $600 billion in new revenues over the next ten years. That is a big if, if you listen to what republican congressman phil gingrey said this morning. 
>> Reporter: At one point the live and divide another day you have to dig in your heels and say by golly I'm going to die over this today because it's important to the people of my district and this country. 

[01:01:37]


>> Are there enough votes in the house to pass this? It will take a combination of democratic and republican votes. If the senate measure does get through the house here is what the plan means. Bush era tax cuts would stay in place for individuals earning less than $400,000 and couples earning $45,000. Unemployment benefits for 2 million americans would be extended for a year and the alternative minute tax would be permanently adjusted for inflation, but when it comes to spending cuts, lawmakers deferred for two more months, kicking the can down the road as they say, so we can expect more finger pointing, more fighting in 2013. Happy new year, everyone. White house correspo ianna keilar joins us live from washington. She'll be watching over the next few months and more importantly watching today what is happening. This is not over yet. 
>> No, and happy new year to you, john, as well. It looks like it's going to go one or twodirections, it starts with house speaker john boehner meeting with his republican members and see about what they think of the deal struck in the senate. If there is enough support among republicans and there may be some more than say we would have seen for the cutoff being $1 million that failed because the tax hikes have gone into effect and they're just voting for tax cuts. If there is enough support he could take up the senate measure put it on the floor and pass it, we would expect with democratic and republican support or house republicans may say this isn't enough to our liking, we want to change some things and they could propose to amend some things and succeed to do so and send it back over to the senate. 
>> If it is amended, then it gets mess brianna, correct? 
>> It depends. If something is fundamentally changed it could put at risk the agreement in the senate. If it's just a little tweak or something to make house republicans feel like they got a little bit better of a deal, then it might be something that the senate could swallow. That would depend and this is what I think we'll be seeing today, where are house republicans or where are the majority of house republicans or a big chunk of house republicans, are they okay with this, what kind of changes do they want. 

[01:03:58]


>> We'll be watching that as speaker boehner begins to talk to his republican caucus before noon today and of course stay with cnn all day, we'll keep you up to date on the latest negotiations and deal-making. 
>> Let's go capitol hill, jonathan allen, senior congressional correspondent for politico. Jonathan it doesn't need all republicans or democrats to get the deal done. It requires john boehner to take this vote to the floor, he'll get some pressure from the conservative side of his caucus not to do that. Any chance the house scuttles this without even talking about it? 
>> The message that speaker boehner has put out is that it will come to a vote, whether it's that bill the senate passed or perhaps some slightly amended version that could be sent back to the senate. He is not giving the option of doing nothing to his conference so you've heard from phil gingrey of georgia on cnn, tim hillscamp of kansas. There are some guys who don't like the deal and will vote against them but the odds of them standing in way of an ultimate deal are very small. 
>> We talked about this an hour ago, the idea o not voting for it versus actively campaigning for it, they might not vote for it so they can say to their constituents I didn't support this but it's not the same as getting a movement against it. 
>> That's exactly right. I think if they tried to they would be unsuccessful and in terms of those voting no, maco rubio of florida and rand paul of kentucky, among those who voted no and two of the others, the iowa senators harkin and grassley from that first in the nation caucus state. 
>> Interesting. 
>> At least marco rubio and rand paul looking at what those guys are doing. 

[01:05:59]


>> In the house you'll see paul ryan voting against this. 
>> I haven't talked to congressman ryan and I'm not necessarily sure how he's going to vote. I haven't seen anything from him on this. I wouldn't be surprised either way he voted on it. There's political advantage in voting no but he's also been somebody who has been looked at as a leader in the house of representatives, a guy who will take tough votes when he needs to. One thing that's happed in the last 24 hours, everyone's gotten a day older and we are looking at being $4 trillion deeper in debt. 
>> Right. 
>> As a result of this deal, it's not really a deficit reduction package. 
>> It is not at all. Jonathan thank you for that. You bring up a good point this may become the albatross around people's neck who decide to run for the presidency so there are people who are not thinking about it as today's deal but the deal for their political future. Jonathan allen at the politico, at the capitol, thank you. 
>> My pleasure. 
>> It is slowing the national debt if you can, adding to the national debt more slowly. 
>> It may not be debt reduction but it may be deficit reduction. 
>> Let's break down what's in this deal. We've been telling you about the dairy cliff. The senate deal would extend federal farm policies through september. Milk prices will not double. The deal nixed a set pay raise for members of congress. The white house skirted a raise of tax rates on larger estates from 30% to 40% but republicans said it should be adjusted annually for inflation, that would increase the estate exemption to $7.5 million for individual $15 million for couples by the year 2020. 
>> We're going to stay right there on the hill where later today we expect the house to take up the senate bill or some kind of bill. Lloyd doggett is a democrat from texas, member of the budget committee, arguing to end the bush era tax cuts for the wealthy. I take that means you're likely a yes vote. 

[01:08:15]


>> I'd like to be but like to see the fine print in the agreement I doubt many membersed of the senate were able to study carefully at 2:00 in the morning and to evaluate the tradeoffs. I'm pleased they reached a last-mute agreement but that agreement instead of becoming a pumpkin at midnight became landmark legislation and we need to evaluate it closely. 
>> You want to evaluate and some congressmen said they're likely nos or likely yeses. All say they want to see it to make the determination. What is your guess if it is put to a vote it will likely pass. 
>> I think it will pass in some form. There's still a question as to whether amendments are offered here, and of course as you've also noted big question here that having circumvented the dangers of the cliff here at new year's that we soon face the valentine day cliff and perhaps the april fool's day cliff because of all the things that are not in this agreement. 
>> Heading into the cliffs, you named them aptly, where does your party stand, where does the white house stand in its ability to negotiate heading into the debt ceiling? There are critics showing the president is willing to come off his sticking points when push comes to shove. Is he likely to cave when comes to the debt ceiling? 
>> I think the president tried to provide leadership for the entire country and I applaud that. I think republicans have taken away a message in the past. I voted against the late night agreement that was reached in 2010 as being very unbalanced. Republicans took away from that experience that if they are hard enough, difficult enough, extreme enough and just keep pushing that eventually they'll get major concessions from the president. They certainly did not get as many this time as they did in 2010. The president has said no negotiations over the debt ceiling but he also said that $250,000 was the level at which we would see a return to the clinton level tax levels. I believe that $450,000 is hardly middle income in america. It may be the median income of republican campaign contributors but it's certainly not the medium income of a family in central texas. Now that's enshrined permanently in the law and a troubling feature. 

[01:10:53]


>> It is a very troubling feature that we defined the middle class starting at $450,000 a year, that's another battle for another day. Is it wise for the president to come out and say no negotiations on the debt ceiling? That's a real problem. Is was a real problem as well but the debt ceiling could shut american government down. 
>> Well, we have to stand behind the full faith and credit of the united states. Also the related question of how we handle the across the board spending cuts or sequestration, it is encouraging in that regard that there was a precedent set and insistence that was not all coming out of health care research and educational opportunity that half of it was revenued for this postponement, but that looms very largely as we go forward. 
>> Congressman, thank you very much for joining us. We appreciate your insight into this and we wish you the best of the new year. 
>> Median income is $55,000 a year. When we talk about setting the new label of rich is $450,000 and above. 
>> What seems to be shaking down is this, democrats are likely to vote for the measure in near unanimity. Lloyd doggett voted against the debt deal two years ago so if he voted against that and is willing to vote for this you're getting almost all the democrats so this does become an issue of how many votes the republicans will deliver and that is something to be watching very closely. 
>> They don't need a lot. 
>> If they don't get close to a majority it puts speaker boehner in a really, really tough behind. 
>> Though it does change the dynamic when you put it forth as everybody vote up or down based on your conscience. It doesn't speak to his leadership and able to whip, if you go out there and say this is the equivalent of a free vote, this is a do what you got to do for your constituents. 
>>> While the fiscal cliff was being haggled in washington, americans celebrated the arrival of the new year. Some people managed to celebrate despite the fiscal cliff talks. An estimated 1 million people from around the world jammed into new york city to ring in 2013 in traditional fashion. Three hours later, 2013 arrived in seattle, and a spectacular fireworks display illuminated the sky with the space needle at the center of it all. Now an army of sanitation workers do the monumental task of cleaning it up, they do it so fast you wouldn't know what happened at this point. It is 2013 and same-sex couples in maryland have something to celebrate. Seven couples got hitched just after midnight at city hall in baltimore with the mayor officiating. 

[01:13:43]


>>> Secretary of state h clinton is still in the hospital being treated for a blood clot. We'll have details straight ahead. 
>>> Whether this gets approved will have an impact on the global economy. What to expect ahead. 
>>> We'll look at how berlin rang in -- 
>> I was just thinking that. 
>> I was up all night wondering how berlin would ring in the new year. You get to see there. We'll be back in a minute. dream? I'm having one right now. I don't want to be disturbed. And I won't. Because before I went to sleep, I set this. Now my iphone knows not to ring, unless it's important. 'Cause disturbing this would just be .. wrong. 

[01:17:08]


>>> Well it sounds a lot scarier than it is thankfully. Secretary of state hillary clinton is being treated in a new york hospital for a blood clot in her head. Her doctors say they're confident she will make a full recovery. Cnn's jill dougherty is live at the state department. How serious is this? 
>> Potentially, christine, it's serious. After all, it is in her head but as doctors explain, it's not in her brain, and that's the most important thing. This is a blood clot that's located in kind of an area that is between the brain and the skull. It's a vein, and between those two areas, but it's not as i said inside the brain and that is one of the reasons that they say she didn't have any neurological problems, she didn't have a stroke. Things that really could be serious. That said, she is in the hospital, she's getting the treatment which is essentially giving her blood thinners and what they're trying to do is shrink the blood clot and then when they figure out how much medication she should have, then potentially she can be released from the hospital. So it's quite a bout for her. Don't forget this started way back in december, I remember being on the trip to europe with her, coming back and the next trip was canceled and that's when all of this began, getting the flu, hitting her head, having the concussion and now this. 
>> She has certainly been an energizer bunny over the past couple years. Look, she has been around the world logging millions of miles. It's rare to see her, it's rare to see her laid up like this. 
>> It is. I was thinking that sitting here in the quiet state department today on a holiday and thinking you know, this was a woman who was really made of iron and she is very strong. This is extraordinary, the flu set in motion all this stuff. That said, it is the end of her term in office, and we all know secretary clinton has said she wants to retire and we just have a few more weeks but they're all questions, remember she wa going to testify on benghazi, we'll see how that goes and also her travel was on told hold. 

[01:19:17]


>> Jill dougherty thank you so much. Happy new year. 
>> Same to you. 
>>> Ahead on "starting point" the whole world is watching what congress does with this new fiscal cliff deal, what it could do with global markets next, WITH RICHARD QUEST.risks. But she's still going to give me a heart attack. That's health in numbers. UnitedHealthcare. 

[01:22:50]


>>> Minding your business markets are closed today waiting to see how the fiscal cliff COULD AFFECT YOUR 401(k) IN THE Early part of the new year. Of course, u.S. Markets all finished 2012 on a high note. The dow gained more than a percent yesterday to finish the year above the 1,000 mark and ali, as you know, it was a good year for the stock market 
>> it was a better year until the fiscal cliff messed it up. The s&p 500 which looks like PEOPLE'S 401(k)s WAS UP 15%, Ends up 12.5. 
>> One of the ten best years ever. 
>> I would say 12. 
>> It's not bad. Despite europe and despite the fiscal cliff, markets did okay. Markets around the world are closed for new year's day which is why congress has itself today to get this done, otherwise you'd see some reaction. 
>> You can only be over the cliff when the markets are closed and have a little bit of breathing space. 
>> Markets open about 12 hours from now. Cnn's richard quest joins from us london. Poor richard, you've had to deal with all of the stuff in europe for the last two years and then this. You have remarkable world experience as how the worlds investors who tend to be enforcers of politics sometimes will respond to this deal and i know you've been studying the deal all morning. 
>> I have, well as much as anybody can on the first day of a new year. If you look at what europe has been through in 2012, the european stability mechanism, the banking union debacle, the third bailout for greece, constantly with the fiscal comeback, you see similarities between what happened in europe and what now the united states has just been through and is going to go through in 2013. Obviously the facts are different, but the substance remains the same and it is basically this, pushing as far and as hard as you can without actually tipping over the edge, until the markets eventually say oh, enough. You've got to do a deal. And ali and christine, one of the things that is quite clear is that in 2013, yes, the fiscal cliff deal has been done but these other problems of appropriations of debt ceiling, they are the ones that are going to come back to bite again and again, and that's very similar to the sort of problems and issues they've seen in europe. 

[01:25:09]


>> More difficult problems. John berman is completely out of sorts that you didn't refer to him so helike to get in on the conversation. 
>> It is not the full deal, not the grand bargain that president obama and speaker boehner were talking about two months ago. Richard, you've seen a lot of problems here over there. Growth is not what it is in the u.S. Isn't the u.S. Doing some things right, right now? 
>> Yes, it didn't go for the grinding austerity that everybody else did, because it didn't need to. It has large, liquid, deep financial markets, so yes, it is doing a lot right, but that 2%, 2.5% growth that you're talking about, john, is very wafer thin. It wouldn't take much for investor confidence to evaporate and wouldn't take much for that growth to I wouldn't say go negative but at least to go stagnant and that's the big fear in all of this. It's not are things going well now, it's what can the u.S. Economy trip over in the first three months, say for example, of 2013. I have a question for you, by the way. John, you might like to join in on this, with the s&p and I'm trying to go backwards here fast. Which do you think was the best performing mar globally percentage wise in 2012? 
>> I know, greece, greece, greece, was it greece? 
>> Hold on, everybody gets a guess. You say greece. 
>> I say stop & shop. Which market. 
>> Country. 
>> I'm going with greece. 
>> I'm going to pull a richard quest here and I'm going to go with nigeria. 
>> Ali, you're in the right line but the wrong part of the world, venezuela's general index rose some 300%, currency risk, a political problem but eh, who's worried about that. 

[01:27:11]


>> Greece is up 33%. 
>> Quest, good to see you, my friend as always. We'll be talking more with richard quest, whenever you're traffic quest is must see tv right after "world business today" which is the show I do on cnn international. Quest, have a fun and busy day. Question an hour ago said the reason the u.S. Will never be greece because greece can't issue bonds, we can, and I said the u.S. Will always be able to print enough money and you know I've awakened the beasts, twitter has gone nuts with people who say I'm going to devalue the u.S. Currency. I'm not saying we should but I'm saying there is a reason we will never get into a pickle greece is in. 
>> Great segue to our next guest, ahead on "starting point," the formeread of the fdic, does she think this is a right solution or another game of kick the can and these guys really, really wanted to get into this safe. They used a blow torch and it's all on camera, that is just ahead, stay with us. You're watching "starting point." I think your friends will understand.

>>> And it is all up to the house of representatives now to bring us back from the bottom o the fiscal cliff this morning. Technically we are over the cliff this morning, still early this morning the senate passed a deal crafted by vice president biden and the senate minority LEADER mitch McConnell. The vote overwhelming 89-8 but because the republican controlled house left well before midnight the house has to take up the measure later this morning. This is how the early morning accomplish amounts are summed up. 
>> Here is how the senate plan will work if it passes the house, bush era tax cuts extended for individuals earning less than $400,000 and couples earning less than $450,000. Unemployment benefits extended for a year for 2 million americans and a permanent adjustment for inflation to the alternative minimum tax. If you're wondering about spending cuts? Keep wondering. Lawmakers deferred and they will fight that fight over the next two months. Despite the progress overnight in the senate, the house must still follow suit and based on this comment earlier this morning from tim huelskamp, it's no doubt. 
>> We haven't seen anything. This deal will increase spending and it does nothing for our fundamental overspending problem and our lack of entitlement reform, three strikes looks like what is in the bill for my view and I don't know if it will pass the house. We'll find out obviously later today. 
>> What if the deal runs into trouble? That's possible. Many house republicans have long opposed any tax increase, many signed that no tax pledge. Lawmakers likely have a grace period of a couple of weeks to pass a bill to avoid the bulk of the scheduled tax increases and spending cuts without causing too much damage. The markets are closed today, the house has breathing space today. How long they drag this out, what signal that sends the stock market. 

[01:33:53]


>> The international market opens 12 hours from now. I was so consumed by the deal i didn't recalculate yesterday was a strong day on the u.S. Market. The s&p gained 1.7% yesterday to end the year at 13.4%, that's a gain. 
>> Don't stiff the s&p. 
>> A LOT OF YOUR 401(k)s WILL Look like that if you're in the s&p 500. Our next guest is an expert about the affect the deal would have. Sheila bair, former chair of the federal deposit insurance corporation and currently chair of the systemic risk council, author of "bull by the horns" good to see you. Thank you for being with us. 
>> Thanks for having me. 
>> We're having a lot of activity on the conversation we're having why not dealing with the u.S. Debt and deficit situation which is a serious issue still doesn't get us into a place like greece. The u.S. Has certain flexibility in its financial and fiscal systems that other countries don't have. 
>> Right. Well that's true. We can print our own money so yes if we continue this profligate spending without sufficient money to pay for it, other countries can buy our debt. Third world countries try that and it usually doesn't end well but another potential glitch is congress has to keep raising the debt limit to allow that kind of mechanism to continue so even though we can print our own currency which reduces the risk of a credit default, if congress refuses to raise the debt limit that could force default and increase problems for us. 
>> Your book is called "bull by the horns" and do you think this is our government taking the bull by the horns this deal? 
>> No. I wish I could say it really is kicking the can down the road when it. They did make some decisions, permanent inflation indexing of the amt which is good, that's been going on for a long time. We've got permanent extension of the lower rates for less than 450,000, 400,000 for individuals. They made some decisions that will cost a lot of money over what would have occurred if we let all of the tax cuts expire. Nothing in the way of deficit reduction and this isoing to be the big question in the house, they pretty consistency said they wanted something on the spending side and not really getting it. In a couple of months they'll have another bite at the apple as the debt limit comes to a head and the delay of sequestration also comes to a head 

[01:36:34]


>> a big assumption this is a turning point, a beginning of a new era in washington, how do you think they should do entitlement reform and big paydown and debt and deficit reduction. 
>> The tax system is broken, the entitlement system is broken and we haven't even gotten to immigration reform, infrastructure. There are so many problems that need to be addressed and we need a functioning government to deal with them and it takes so long just to get really small deals like this done. It's quite disspiriting and i think we need to find a governing coalition in the country and the president with all due respect needs to reach out to republicans instead of bashing them or heckling them. I GO BACK TO THE 1980s, I WORKED With bob dole, ronald reagan was president. There were a lot of reagan democrats who switched over and tip o'neill knew that and that's why he worked with president reagan. The partisanship needs to stop. We need to govern not from the hard liners but the middle. 
>> You're referring to the news conference the president gave yesterday afternoon did raise a lot of eyebrows we talked about a lot over the day yesterday. 
>> It did. 
>> It is new year's, try to be glass half full. This was not a giant deal, it was puny as ali velshi has been calling it all morning but on the plus side all of the measures taken and voted on, they're not counterproductive. They're the steps along the way big picture people like you wanted to see. They needed to keep going further. 
>> It is and we may see a series of incremental steps to get us to the point we need to be. I'm not optimistic based on past experience. We do keep kicking the can down the road and every time we do that the deficits and the debt gets bigger. I think that's the longer this goes on, the harder it is to fix. So let's take the optimistic view maybe this is the beginning of a governing coalition. Vice president biden was extremely helpful. If they had done plan b, the chain cpi, if the republicans supported their speaker the gop would be in a better position and have something on the spending side, they didn't. Hopefully some lessons have been learned and we have the beginnings of a governing cowigs we so desperately need. 

[01:39:09]


>> We'll see that play out today, john boehner's leadership will be in tight focus. 
>> It will be. 
>> Thank you for being here. 
>> Thanks for having me. 
>> Sheila brought up a name we haven't talked about, vice president joe biden instrumental and the smile on his face as he was walking around capitol hill, he's like I am in the middle of this, I'm in both feet, happy man. 
>> Because last week the sniping between harry reid and mitch McCONNELL WAS PRETTY DRAMATIC And many points downright unhelpful, and to somehow see joe biden go in there and i don't know what he did. Look at that smile. I don't want fairy dust he's sprinkled all over the place but it helped. 
>> Every minute he's spent in the senate he used yesterday. 
>> He used all that.

-??]??9???????? L@??o N????wyg??!nB w w wt<@m=m=m=o?>??kFokDr 
>>> Welcome back to "starting point," everyone. We are getting more information from hillary clinton's doctors concerning the blood clot that landed the secretary of state in the hospital. It is located in her head between her brain and her skull. We bring in chief medical correspondent dr. Sanjay gupta. Sanjay happy new year. 
>> To you as well. 
>> We're lucky you apparently have a head with a brain that you carry around your bag at all times. Tell us about this blood clot, where is it and what it means? 
>> I want to show you on the model. We know it's on the right side but forpurposes we'll show you the right side. You make out the brain there's a blood vessel in blue right across here. Those are some of the big draining veins, takes blood away from the brain. There's one here called the transverse sinus, big vein and that's where that clot is, it's related to her concussion, it was brought on by that, the doctors say that, but that particular clot is what they're trying to address now these blood thinning medications. Let me make it more simple. Blood goes to the brain and blood has to leave the brain. If the blood does not leave the brain, the brain will start to swell. There's no place for the blood to go and that's why it's so important to make those clots go away. 

[01:47:41]


>> In the exact location inside the vein also crucial because yesterday you were hearing all sorts of debate if it's in the head you can't use blood thinner. Explain this. 
>> So when they tal about clots one of the questions you really want to know, is the clot actually on top of the brain, outside the blood vessel but on top of the brain pushing on the brain and if that's the case if you get blood thinners you make the bleeding worse, cause more pressure and also burn a bridge in terms of doing an operation. You can't operate on someone who is on blood thinners. There's two reasons not to do it, if that clot is not actually inside the blood vessel. In this case it is inside the blood vessel so the anti-coagulants or blood thinners are the most effective and most common treatment. 
>> How would they watch to see if they resolved it, another mri to check for it? 
>> Probably another mri. What we're describing is rare, this is a rare occurrence and typically doesn't happen that afternoon and it can happen with head trauma but more commonly associated with certain medications that increase your coagulation, but yes, you want to make sure that clot eventually is gone. Also if you've have a headache or anything else you want to make sure they go away and they should if the clot is gone. She's had a rough couple of weeks. 
>> The doctors expect a full complete recovery. 
>> They've been very detailed, no stroke. This can cause stroke, hasn't happened, no neurological complications as a result of this, so I've read these statements very carefully to make sure they're saying the things we need to be hearing. 
>> Dr. Sanjay gupta thank you especially after you ran your midnight road race. 
>> Trying to stay healthy myself. Happy new year.

>> ?????? It's a beautiful day ???????????? 
>> fifteen years ago no one thought adults should suffer from acne, but they did. And adults made due with all kinds of remedies; harsh, drugstore stuff designed for teenagers. 

[00:02:04]


>> I have a bunch of empty tubes of things. Cleansers, different lotions from dermatologists. 
>> Prescriptions with unwanted side effects. 
>> Prescription after prescription, my skin was not happy. 
>> And then along came two dermatologists trained at stanford university medical center with a big idea. Doctors katie rodan and kathy fields knew that a majority of adult women in america struggled with acne, monthly breakouts and zits popping up at all the wrong times, and that there had to be a better way to treat it. 
>> The big wow with proactiv is we didn't just spot treat after the fact, that's "reactive." Proactive means take control, treat the whole face, and then every day you prevent the process. Now, that's proactive. 
>> They created proactiv solution, a three step acne treatment system based on a revolutionary combination therapy, a unique blend of powerful medicine with elegant skincare. It was an answer for acne, and it worked. 
>> I could tell proactiv was a different type of product right away. Within three days, the blemishes began to clear up, and within a week I really did have beautiful skin. 
>> Proactiv has done wonders for my skin, it's clear, it's not red anymore. For me, itust the best skin treatment out there. 
>> From 10,000 customers in 1995 to over a million five years later, word of mouth turned proactiv into a sensation, amassing over 20 million customers worldwide. And infomercials like the one you're watching told the stories. One success after another. Real people sharing their before and after photos. Millions found relief and great hope. Anars lined up to share their real stories, too.

[00:04:06]


>> Proactiv is now the number one best selling acne system in america. And coming up, find out how you can get our most popular problem solver, the dark spot corrector, free! 
>> It just made a huge difference on even sun spots that I had. Every day it gets better and better, and better. 
>> Proactiv is definitely part of my life now. It just feels good to finally have clear skin. My confidence shot up, I wanted to go out more with my friends. Proactiv gave me joy. ?????? >>i, I'm melissa claire egan. In the last few years, millions of men and women worldwide have discovered proactiv solution from friends who recommendt, from success stories on tv, and accolades from the biggest beauty magazines in the world. Then the best got even better when proactiv introduced new proactiv with powerful micro-crystal medicine that delivers results faster and gentler than before. And again, proactiv is changing lives.

>> The secret to proactiv is our advanced micro-crystal medicine, which penetrates pores to kill acne causing bacteria at the source, while soothing botanicals leave your skin feeling smooth, healthy looking and beautiful. 
>> Clear skin is probably, to me, the most beautiful thing about a person. They can put makeup on, they can do their hair, they can wear nice clothes, but when you strip it down, that's the real beauty, and you don't want to cover that up, you want to flaunt it. 
>> Daytime television star melissa claire egan experienced terrible breakouts in college. 
>> I'd be having this great time with my friends taking pictures, smiling. I remember, I'd literally get these pictures back, and I'd be like "oh! I know I was having so much fun, but my skin looks brutal!" Just totally ruined the picture. It's your pictures, it's your memories of these awesome times, and you're not proud of them. I knew I needed to get rid of this acne, and proactiv worked for me. It's as fabulous and as simple as that. Pictures. Everybody's taking pictures. They're posting pictures, they're tagging you in pictures, and if you have acne, it's what everybody sees. And it could be the first thing someone notices about you. 

[00:06:38]


>> You know, you have ten fferent zits, you know, connect the dots on your forehead, so you're just-- you just know taking a picture that it doesn't look good. 
>> Oh boy, this picture-- this is me. Ah! 
>> I don't like all this stuff down here. Not my favorite, and I love that it's not here now. 
>> Mad, crabby, upset. That's me really stressed out, not liking how I look. Proactiv, it cleared everything up. Clear skin just put me in a much better mood. 
>> Meet naya rivera. She acts, she sings, and she's on one of the hottest shows on television. But a couple years ago, just as her career was taking off, she started breaking out. 
>> With glee, I'm on tv every week. I'm like playing a high school teenager, and here I am, like, an adult in real life struggling with acne. It kind of came out of nowhere, and it was, you know, pretty depressing. Being on tv every week, it adds a little bit more pressure. Luckily, the hair and makeup people at glee carried proactiv. And I started to see change and results. It was such a relief, and I felt really, really good again about my skin, and it brought back a lot of confidence. Proactiv really, really worked for me, and it's proven. 
>> Acne can destroy your confidence, and it seems so random. You probably think it's out of your control to do anything about it. So, if you want a fresh new start for back to school, a new job, a relationship, keep watching, and learn how you can change yourself or help someone you love. 
>> When I see my clear skin, it just gives me that extra confidence. I don't even have to put makeup on. I put my hair up in a pony tail and I feel great just going to class without having to cover up anything. I feel amazing. 
>> Now that I have clear skin with proactiv, sometimes I forget how bad it was previously. It's such a big change. It really has just changed my life and I can be confident as an adult now in everything I do day to day at work be taken seriously, and you really can't put a price on that.

How could you miss them? You know, every time you turn on the tv, there's perfect skin staring at you. And the first thing that I would always feel was jealousy. 'Cause I would see those people and I would think, "i'm never going to have skin like that ever." What really got me to try proactiv was the fact that I know so many people who use it. And I ordered proactiv. And within five days, the breakouts had stopped. And within a couple weeks, my skin was smoothing out. I had terrible acne for 20 years. And I've been on proactiv for a year.

>> Proactiv has been celebrated and imitated, embraced by the most famous faces in the world, stars who can afford anything but depend on proactiv to keep their skin clear. 
>> I've struggd with acne since I was ten years old, and as I got older, it just got worse and worse and worse. And right before I started filming friday night lights, one of the producers even told me like, "don't even worry about it, jurnee, you're playing a teenager. It's natural for you to have acne." And so I would tell myself, "the bumps add to my character." But in reality, I was a young woman. I had just gotten engaged. I was planning my wedding. I didn't want to be breaking out in real life. A friend of mine who was in the hair and makeup department quietly slipped me a box of the three step system, and I didn't tell anyone that I was using proactiv except for my fiance, he knew. Day by day, week by week, not only was it clearing up my skin, but my skin was starting to look really healthy. And a month into it, I was like, "okay, I'm hooked." 
>> Have you ever seen a proactiv commercial and asked yourself, could it really be that easy to have clear skin? To prove that proactiv does what it says, we challenge some acne sufferers who have never tried proactiv to give it a shot. 
>> Having so many people who supporthe product, that makes me feel like really excited and really kind of anxious to get the whole process started. 
>> The worst part about acne is feeling insecure about how I look, picking out whatever it is you're wearing and your makeup and you look in the mirror and you're just like, "none of this matters because all I see is this." 
>> It's a very visual world so it's tough, you know. And I've tried just about everything there is. So, it's really frustrating unfortunately. 

[00:21:45]


>> Everything, especially on the sides of my cheeks, underneath, around here. If I can just get 60 percent of what's on my skin, if I could clear that up that would be amazing. 
>> There were great first impressions on day one. 
>> It feels great, just like, you know, fresh and clean. 
>> And I can feel the little beads exfoliating my skin. 
>> The toner's really nice. 
>> Got a little--little tingle action. 
>> The repairing treatment is really smooth. 
>> It's actually absorbing really quickly into my skin which feels really good. 
>> It's almost like the icing on the cake, you know? It just kind of does that last little layer that my skin is really thanking me right now. 
>> I'm really excited. Honestly, I can't wait to-- to see how this works for me, and to do it every day. 
>> We took photos along the way and there were great results to smile about. 
>> My skin is clearing up, which is pretty amazing. 
>> I just feel like my skin overall is just glowing, the texture of it, the look of it, it just looks better. 
>> I had a lot of stuff going on here and it's all going down and going away. The results are there so it's awesome. I'm on my way to clear skin. 
>> I was feeling my skin today. It's so soft, like, and smooth. And that alone, I'm like, god, it just feels good. 
>> With proactiv, seeing is believing. 
>> For real, proactidid this. My skin is more radiant. It's more even toned. It's not bumpy anymore. That's amazing. I wish I would have tried proactiv years ago. 
>> Since I've been using proactiv, I don't have to be frustrated. I don't have to question. I don't have to worry about my skin being bad 'cause you know what? I've got control over it. Within two to three weeks I could see a consistent change in my skin, and it started clearing up, you know, very quickly. I was really like, "okay, this is some good quality skin here." 
>> With proactiv I can truly say today, this is the best my skin has ever been. I just feel more radiant which is what I've always wanted. I've always wanted to have that movie star skin and now I look in the mirror and I'm like, "yes." ??????

But have you the power to reset the clock and restart your body from the inside out. It all starts today. All right. I'm going to talk about the heart. Where's emily sitting? 

[00:03:19]


>> Right here. 
Dr. Oz: Hi, emily. How are you? I brought a heart here to you. 
>> Yes, please. 
Dr. Oz: Your heart is the size of the fist. It's emblematic because you can feel it all the time what we're feeling in our life. Why would you want to pick the heart? 
>> Dr. Oz, I just turned 45 years old 3 weeks ago. I'm latina. Heart disease is one of the greatest risk factors in latinas' death. So I'm concerned because of i have seen my grand more than, my mother pass away from a heart attack. 
Dr. Oz: Both of them/ 
>> yes. So I want to have a healthy heart at 800 years old. 
>> Let me hear you describe what you're doing that might not be healthy for your hot, that makes me worried maybe your heart going the same direction as your mom and grandmother? 
>> It's not what I'm doing it's what I'm not doing. I'm not exercising or eating healthy foods all the time. I need to change my life. 
Dr. Oz: That's what this show is all about. You actually have the power to restart your body. We're going to talk about incredibly profound moment for me. I need to speak to everybody about this. All of you have come here today and you have come here because you have come to a point in your life when you realize have you to make a change. What I want to do is tell you cleanly that your organs don't lie to you. That's truth you're looking at. And it will -- to share with you insight that's can profoundly change what you think about life. Hold it up. Let me see it. Put it up there. It's remarkable. You're holding life in your hands. Feel it. Examine it. Recognize it's really what's going on inside of you. All of those abstract thoughts about maybe I'm doing the wrong thing. Could be affecting my heart or intestines or tie roid or liver. It's not abstract. It's concrete. You're holding it. Have you the power to change what you're holding in your hands and what's in your body by making simple adjustments to what you're having. This why this show is occurring today. That's why I'm passionate and waiting for this moment for a long, long time. So, if I could ask you to stand. You picked the thyroid. Let's show that to everybody. Why did you pick the thyroid gland? 

[00:05:32]


>> Because I'm tired all the time, I don't have the energy that I used to have in my 20's and I gained all of this weight in my late 30's and I don't know why and I'm assuming it's my thyroid. 
Dr. Oz: I'm just trying to understand why you think the thyroid is correlated with all of that? Who told you that? 
>> Well, you know, moim had a really bad thyroid problem. So I'm just assuming maybe she passed it on to me and that's why I gained all of this weight. 
Dr. Oz: You beat yourself up a little bit because you gained the weight? 
>> Kind of. Dr. Something? 
>> Sure. 
Dr. Oz: This gland is a remarkably common reason, scarely common reason why women gain weight, feel tired, don't look as pretty as they want to be, why we actually age. I don't want pounding on yourself anymore. I want to talk today about why this may be the perfect organ for you to restart in order to restart your whole body. Let me hear from somebody else. Who else has thoughts? What did you pick her? 
>> Intestines. 
Dr. Oz: You did. Stand if you don't mind. Why did you pick intestines? 
>> I picked intestines because i suffer from irritable bowel syndrome and there are times when I eat and it just feels bloaty and some foods can send your body into a frenzy. I just wanted to know a little bit more about that. 
Dr. Oz: I love the way you said that. Your body sends your body into a tailspin. Small little things push you over the edge and small little things get you back on the edge as well. That's what I want to focus on. 
>> Yes. 
Dr. Oz: Hammering home. We can restart this. 
>> Great. 
Dr. Oz: I'm hearing all of you. I understand the concerns you have. I understand how frustrating it is. Those concerns are real. Without question whether you realize it or not, you're all at a turning point. Now, I'm going to show you how to keep your heart strong and pumping a lot longer. I'm going to show you how to detox your liver and how to turn around any damage. We're going to stop that pain in your gut by cleaning out and restarting your intestines. When we come back, I will show you how to restart the number one organ making you feel tired and fat. 

[00:07:38]


[Applause] 
>> up next -- feeling fat and tired and don't know why? 
>> Something to do with your metabolism? 
>> Ready, go! 
>> What could be happening inside you? 
>> Converts fat to energy, which gives you energy. 
>> Three key symptoms you need a restart. 

[00:10:38]


Dr oz: What happened for you? 
>> My husband and I got married and we decided we wanted to have a baby. I thought it was important to restart my body. 
Dr oz: Today we are doing a body restart. I discovered a lot of women out there do not even know what a thyroid does. 
>> I think my thyroid is low. That's my story and time sticking to it. 
>> It's my thyroid, right? Sometimes my jeans get tighter, and I say, it is my thyroid. 
>> It may have something to do with my hormones. I think it breaks down the food or something. 
>> I have no idea what my thyroid is. 
>> I carry it in my stomach area. Maybe it is over here. Maybe if it were in a different part of my body it would be working faster. I don't know. 
Dr oz: Women came down who were most concerned about restarting their thyroid today. Let's start with you. What's concerning you about your thyroid? When did you start blaming your thyroid about what's going on in your body? 
>> After I had my baby, I became exhausted all the time. The truth is, I can't blame my babies anymore, so I'm starting to think there is something more going on, and I'm believing it is my thyroid. 
Dr oz: Vanessa, why do you blame your thyroid for how you are feeling? 
>> Well, everybody links weight gaining to thyroid problem. So me and my girlfriends talk about it all the time, and basically we say we gain weight because of our thyroid. We diet and exercise, and I'm still fat. 

[00:12:51]


Dr oz: You both sort of use that idea of blame and guilt and shame. There are so many women that beat themselves up. They think they are gaining weight and looking old and not being where they are because they are making mistakes. I'm going to tell you that's not the case. 20% of all the women that hear my voice -- older women in particular -- have thyroid issues. We think that is a gross underestimate. It is probably twice that number. Without it functioning healthy, it changes your weight and you don't look as good either. Trina, you said to me you thought it was located right up in here, isn't that right? 
>> Yes. 
Dr oz: This is a big area. 
>> Yes. 
Dr oz: You have a good -- that's the adam's apple there. 
>> Ok. 
Dr oz: Normally the thyroid is here. It would be sort of like that. A thyroid gland, therefore, is located right beneath that adam's apple. Go ahead. Push that little area beneath the adam's apple. If you can feel the gland, that's not a good sign. One of the things we look for as a doctor when we come into the office. So take your gloves off. I have a demonstration to explain why a vital organ -- it is so easy to treat and if it made you feel old and fat and tired, wouldn't you want to treat it? 
>> Yes. 
Dr oz: Trina, you are going to get to be the thyroid gland. 
>> Ok. 
[Laughter] 
dr oz: Have you ever gotten to be the thyroid gland before? 
>> No. 
Dr oz: See these balloons? 
>> Yes. 
Dr oz: That's the fat in the body. What the thyroid does is converts fat into energy. It gives you energy, but it also converts the fat. All you have to do is pop the balloons. So take that in there, sneak in there, and let those fat cells out. Stay in the middle now. There you go. Now, all you have to do, I want you to be the thyroid and start popping those thyroid glands. Go! Ok, stop! You did great. You did great. You got through a lot of fat cells. Now, here's the catch. When your thyroid gland is not working well, which happens when you get older or you are not giving it the right nutrients, you have to put that needle down. Because the thyroid gland, when it loses its power, it has to get rid of those fat cells without the energy that it has. I want you to pay attention to thfment as your thyroid gland gets weaker, it allows fat cells to accumulate. That's effectively wlats happening in people's bodies. Now, I will add to the problem. Now, I want you to go in there and pop all those fat cells. But because of your underactive thyroid, you don't have a pin anymore. Go. Pop them! Pop them! 

[00:16:25]


[Cheers and applause] 
dr oz: Keep going! Keep going! 
[Audience cheering] 
dr oz: What happened? Trina? 
>> It is impossible. 
Dr oz: It is impossible. That's how it feels, right? It feels impossible. All right. It now, come on over here. So there are three symptoms all over that women can look at to see if they have a thyroid problem. Do you experience daily fatigue? Second, that you gained 10 or 15 pounds in the last 15 two years that you can't seem to lose. Especially if you didn't do anything wrong on the way there. 
>> Yes. 
Dr oz: Thanks for being honest. And the last thing, has your hair changed? Has it become course and brittle? These are questions we would often ask to identify if there is a problem. It is a straight-forward way of doing it. I have something better than that. Up next, I'm going to help everybody understand if their thyroid is easy to restart. We have a test at home, simple, and fast. All you have to do is figure it out. 
[Cheers and applause] 
dr oz: Thank you for being here. >>Ing up, the at-home test. 
Dr oz: The only thing you need is this. 
>> Does your thyroid need a restart? 
Dr oz: It is a smart test every woman ought to be doing. 
>> How to restart after a 

[00:21:25]


[cheers and applause] 
dr oz: I'm talking to three women who are sick of feeling old, fat, and tired. They want to know if their thyroid is to blame. How do you figure it out? It turns out there is an easy, at-home thyroid test that you can try, and all you need is this, a thermometer. So take a thermometer. You are going to put it under your tongue in the morning when you first wake up before getting out of bed. That's really important. And you are going to record those results for a week. That's critically important. Then we are going to average those seven numbers out. It is of a sluggish thyroid. Let me ask you, what kind of salts, trina, do you normally cook w 
>> kosher salts. 
Dr oz: Kosher salts do not have eye dine. In fact, 80% of the salt we are adding to our foods no longer has eye dine. So this can't be the way you always go if you worried about your thyroid. This is the way to go if you need iodine. We have told people not to take too much salt in their diet. But I'm here to say, if you are going to take salt into your diet, add one with iodine. The other is look for silenium-rich foods. You see where it is getting large? It is getting large because it is irritated. So vanessa, these are foods you may not think about very much. Two great examples. Mushrooms. Are you a mushroom fan? 

[00:23:36]


>> I like mushrooms. 
Dr oz: Mushrooms. They can be button mushrooms, shitake mushrooms. You can add them into your diet. They are rich. It turns out brazil nuts are also incredibly rich. A powerhous of silenium. I actually snack on brazil nuts. They are a perfect snact because they have so much -- snack because they have so much silenium. I have a whole list of silenium-rich foods at doctoroz.Com. Coming up, if you worri your eating and drinking has caused your liver damage, I'm going to show you how to turn it around next. 
>> Do you want to make today the

[00:28:37]


Dr oz: From the moment you start using your -- from the moment you are born your liver is start working. By the time you are a teen, you have eaten about 1,200 hamburgers scarring your liver. Since your 21st birthday you have probably consumed nearly 2,000 glasses of wine. That's about 120 gallons that your liver has to mop up after. By the time you hit your 30's and 4040's, the chances are you have swallowed thousands of pills for headaches, colds and feefers. 
-- Feefers. In short, a life-time of eating and drinking and make your liver sluggish. The good news is, you can turn it around. Put your hands up. How many liver people are there? One of the more popular. Ok. You are going to join us again. Elizabeth, why did you pick your liver? 
>> I was thinking about the types of food when I ate when i was growing up. I had a wonderful -- I had a mother who was a wonderful cook, but we didn't really know how unhealthy the things she cooked it in were. Frying chicken, bacon grease. I -- 
[inaudible] 

[00:30:43]


dr oz: We have done things in our lives without recognizing the impact they would have. Our organs are able to deal with that for a while, but after a while it is difficult. A lot of people think it is only about alcohol damaging liver. And that's an issue. Alcohol is toxic. In small amounts it is ok. Sometimes we drink too much, but that's not what is causing the problem. What causes the problem is years of eating fatty and sugarry foods. One of the big pblems is diabetes. Do you have diabetes? 
>> My son is a type ii die betic. 
Dr oz: Is your son overweight? 
>> He was overweight. After he was diagnosed, he lost about 35 pounds. 
Dr oz: I don't know if his -- has gotten any better or not? 
>> It is. He has been able to keep his blood sugar low with diet and exercise. 
Dr oz: Great. I want to walk you through some things for anyone concerned about diabetes or just feeling liou don't have any detoxifying elements in your body. I know how much you guys love to eat healthy, right? Especially when you are showing off for your friends? 
>> Yes. 
Dr oz: These are grasses or foods or beverages that are healthy for you. Go ahead and pour it in there. This is your liver. This is what your body does when you eat healthy foods. Even when you eat healthy, there are little bits of junk that gets stuck in there. That's ok, because the liver is designed to clear that out. Give it a couple hours, and it will get rid of it. The problem happens, that when you are not eating healthy lean meats, the greens, but instead eating what has been a more traditional standard american diet, which is doughnuts,ried foods, this is what what it looks like after years. This food literally -- 

[00:33:03]


>> oh. 
Dr oz: Clogs up theiver. And as it does that, you are not leaving any room for filters. It becomes toxic. It is no longer able to deal with cholesterol like it used to. We associate obesity with clogging the heart, butr me on this. It clogs up the liver first. The reason I feel passionate about talking about the liver is it is designed to fix itself. If you arelive, you can fix your liver. 
>> Yeah. 
Dr oz: How do you do it? Two simple steps that are straight forward. I'm going to make this a daily part of my life. I want you to do the same thing. The first is a detoxifying drink. It is a morning elixir. Drink it in the morning, you don't have to think about it anymore. It consists of a quarter cup of warm water that helps flush out the liver. A wedge of lemon juice juice that you squeeze in there, and two dashes of hot sauce. Go ahead and taste a little bit of this. You can have more if you want. The lemon juice actually has vitamin c in it. It is a very potent anti-oxidant . It helps boost blood flow. It is also responsible for getting a filter in the liver to re-- detoxify itself. It is actually a better tasting con cock -- concoction than you can imagine. Give it more hot sauce if you want. This next step is straight forward. You have probably heard rumors about this. Three cups of bitter green vegetables every single day. You can get any mixture you want. These are incredibly important. Because the bitters -- the dandelion greens, for example -- they are good at increasing bile. Bile is coming out of the liver when the liver tries to get rid of the toxins. The greens help you do that. Regular spinach, roughage. Mix it up in a salad anyway you wish. It is part of that three cups regimine every day. You do this every single day, within days, you start to see a change in how it can detoxify itself. Is that a deal? 

[00:35:54]


>> Yes. 
>> I'm having a salad now. 
Dr oz: Starting right now. 
[Applause] 
dr oz: Coming up, I'll tell you the things you can do today to restart your heart. 
[Cheers and applause] 
>> up next, dr. Oz's extended warn ti for your heart. Three ways to keep it pumping. 
Dr oz: We can do it together starting now. 
>> And later, painful stomach issues. 

[00:40:15]


[Cheers and applause] 
dr oz: You want to restart your body, the number one place you must take into consideration for good reason is the heart. Emily mentioned earlier that your mother and your grandmother had heart disease. 
>> Yes. 
Dr oz: In what ways do you take after your mother? 
>> I take after her in many ways. I don't exercise. I don't eat a the proper foods that I should be eating, and i don't cake care of my heart. I haven't had my heart checked. This is why I'm here. 
Dr oz: Why is it you haven't had it checked? 
>> I'm scared. Plus I waited to be on your show so I could have you check it. 
[Laughter] 
dr oz: I will check it, too. But you speak of fear? 
>> Yes. 
Dr oz: Part of the reason I want everyone to hold a whole new organ in your hand is to get past that fear. I want that to be your transformtive moment today. I want everyone that's seeing these organs and say, now that i have seen what is really happening in my body, I can have a vision to change that. You have a vision. You can change all these things we're talking about. The heart is one of the best. So put it down over her let me show you what's going on inside your heart that concerns me. I will give you some simple tips. Inside the blood vessels on the surface of the heart, you've got little blood vessels pouring through them. If you is high, your blood pressure is high, it blocks off the flow of blood causing heart attacks. See the heart? See how beautiful it is? Over time with cholesterol and blood pressure it becomes like a door that is creaky and rusted. A lot of times it leaks back in. Then it goes outside of the heart and it gets bigger and larger. And there are more distresses in the aches and pains of your life, and that growth of the heart is not a good thing. The heart is growing because it is being tortured. As a physician when someone has an enlarged heart, I get more concerned more other problems because I'm wondering what damage is it so I'ing to give everybody an extended warn ti on your heart. 

[00:42:43]


>> I'm excited. 
Dr oz: It is my pledge to you that you can turn around your life and jump start it, even if things have been broken. The first thing is omega 3 supplements. I'm not just talking about omega 3's, I'm talking about specific omega 3's, d.H.A. Omega 3's. 
>> What does d.H.A. Mean? 
Dr oz: It is a long chemical name. All you have to remember is the kind that hes helps the heart is the d.H.A. Kind. Fish oils are good, but they are not as essential. What you look for is d.H.A. Owe mega--- omega 3's. They are vitally important. You want 600 milligrams of d.H.A. Omega 3's. Store it in the fridge, it will last longer. 
>> Ok. 
Dr oz: The next part of my warranty is pass prin -- asprin. A group of people that are over 40 need to take asprin. If you are under 40, you do not need to. Take two baby one-milligram tablets. Two of those will give you good protection by reducing inflammation in the body. But you have to take it the right way. Take an eight-ounce glass of water, take two pills, and then drink an eight-ounce glass of water. You want it to melt in that water. 

[00:44:55]


>> Good to know. 
Dr oz: And the last item on my warranty is soluble fiber. You want to aim for two fistfuls today. You want to do it starting informed. The heart is a loving organ. I can't think of a better thing to ask someone than, hey, did you take your baby asprin or have you taken your omega 3's today? 
[Applause] 
dr oz: Why do you wanted to to behe first day of your life? 
>> I have diabetes, high blood pressure, and my knees hurt. I love.

Dr oz: Today is like a body restart. I know you are busy and have a million things to deal with. But it is a growling, grumbling pain in your gut, it will tell you about the stress. 
>> I eat a meal, and it feels like I'm three months pregnant. It looks like it, too. 
>> It seems like nothing is moving down there. I used to go every day, and now if I go once or twice a week, I'm glad. 
>> When I'm stressed, my stomach just slows up. 
>> I feel like the food is stuck there. 
>> It is like a wall of brick in my stomach. You can feel it. It is so hard and hurts so bad. 
Dr oz: A lot of women think they can live with this and deal with it, and after all, it is jift out there. But you can solve your problems. You don't have to live with belly problems, changes in bowel habits. That stuff is not supposed to be there. That is your body crying out for help. You all see it here, right? When it is like this, I don't think you truly appreciate it. First of all, grab tha here. Grab that from the middle here. Ok. Go ahead.

>> Ok. You have to set that down, because you have a long way to go here. Keep holding it there. Keep going, keep going, keep going. Take a little bit in there. 
>> Ok. 
Dr oz: I still have a ton left over here. When you see this, this is four or five days at a time. 
>> No wonder. I only go once a week. 
[Laughter] 
dr oz: Excellent point. When you digest your food, the food moves through here automatically. It passes through the rectum way down there. Pu -- but your digestion is important. It is affected by stress. Kids, parents, household stress. It short-circuits. When it short-circuits, it causes an intestinal blackout. That's bloating, contspation, diarrhea. This intestin wraps up in a knot and does not work anymore. The good news is, you can restart your intestins. You can come back and kick your gut pain for good with pr ebiotics. Did you hear what I said? P-r-e. You both said what most people think of, probiotics. Prebiotics go hand in hand. If you don't have them together, it is like sonny without cher. I apologize to everyone, because I should have talked to everyone about prebiotics a long time ago. They go in your intestine and they help your gut by giving you the right bacteria. Your bacteria only stays alive if you feed them. Yourntestines go to war and support you. Let me show you. What is a prebiotic? Now you will know what they are. Cooked grains, banana, honey, onions have them. These are foods we can get two to four serves a day. They can dramatically change the intestinal flora. I'm hoping this is helpful. You pick and choose what you need. You want to get that 26 feet of intestine to work the way they should. Thank you.

Give this to everyone that you love. Now, if you are wondering how did we ever get all these in here today, take a look at what it took to make it happen. First we selected a special team of medical students. Then the mission of my hospital was to locate the organs for the biggest anatomy lesson ever on the "dr. Oz show." Yesterday we gathered at the hospital to survey the organs to best match the body parts our audience wanted to restart, including heart, brain, kidney, and intestines. The specimens they collected were placed in cold bags and taken to the studio. Once the organs arrived at the studio, we carefully delivered them for stora overnight. This morning, we opened the coolers, removed the plastic, and put the organs onto the train. These are your body parts. We treat them with respect. This was an experience I will not forget.

[Cheers and applause] 
dr. Oz: Welcome to the show. If there's one thing I hear from just about all of you, it's your lack of energy. You feel like your body is shutting down. You're constantly drained and you just can't figure out why. So today we are putting an end to your exhaustion. There's an energy crisis in america, and I'm not talking about the price of gas. 
>> When it comes to my energy i feel like a walking zombie. 
>> From all corners of the country, you sent in your biggest complaints on video. 
>> Everybody else is like they're going 95 miles per hour. I feel like I'm going two. 
>> You posted on my facebook page. Fatigue, not enough energy. 
>> I'm the opposite of the energizer bunny. I'm never going. 
>> You sent me tweets on twitter. "Feeling tired, lack of energy." 
>> I feel like I'm going on fumes all day long. 
>> I feel like my energy is over. 
>> I heard you loud and clear and I say it's time to rev up, america. The one simple solution to put an end once and for all to your energy crisis. 
[Applause] 
dr. Oz: Julie, ann, and kathy are three women who represent a cross-section of america. Each has a different complaint about their energy. See if julie's story sounds familiar. 

[00:02:02]


>> I'm a full-time mom with a full-time job and I spend most of my life running around with my kids. I need my energy back. 
Dr. Oz: A lot of crying in the background there. 
>> Yes, a very stressful morning. 
Dr. Oz: What is responsible for crashing your energy? 
>> That would be my three active children. Their schedules have me going crazy. To give you a glimpse into my day. We all get up at 6:00 in the morning. I have to get them ready for where they need to be and get myself ready to be at work on time every day. When we get ready in the morning, I have to make lunch, I have to get sneakers tied, this, that. Get in the car. I have to drop one at one place, the other at another place, another at another place and get myself to work by 8:30 every morning, it's draining and exhausting. 
Dr. Oz: I'm tired hearing it. So when you're low on energy, what do you do? 
>> I get irritable and moody. I snap at my kids and I feel very guilty, you know. If one needs a shoe tied then the other one needs a bowl to eat cereal, I get snappy and angry. I feel awful about it in the end. 
Dr. Oz: What else stresses you out? What other things zap your energy? 
>> When I'm on my way to work, there could be traffic, it could be raining. People, gas pedal to the right, it's only a little bit of rain, let's go, I have to get to work. If someone cuts me off I'm honking my horn. When we get home it's a long day, the kids are fighting, my husband walks through the door and a snap at him, can't you help me? They're fighting. I'm trying to do this. It's draining and he can haasing. I need my energy back. 
Dr. Oz: Your story is one picture of what low energy looks like in america. I have a couple of more. Let's share ann's story with you. See if this reminds you of anything. 
>> I'm a stay-at-home mom with children. My mom is running a mile a minute and my energy level is running on empty. 

[00:04:09]


Dr. Oz: On, ann, what causes your energy to crash? 
>> I wake up in the morning and I feel exhausted and I feel very anxious all day. And my two children -- I have a 3-year-old and a 10-week-old and I'm anxious because my daughter is constantly pulling on my leg. My little one is always crying and I feel like, am I doing the right thing or the wrong thing? I feel like I'm a twister. 
Dr. Oz: The kids are obviously part of the story. But do you think you had these same types of energy issues before you had kids? 
>> I did. As a teenager I always was very anxious, am I doing the right thing, saying the right things? I've always second-guessed myself, my anxiousness. 
Dr. Oz: When you have that low energy, what do you do about it? 
>> I try to have a cup of coffee to get me going and that's it. There's nothing that has helped me with anything so far. 
Dr. Oz: These are faces of what I see about energy loss in america. Anxiety is a big tip-off for me and I'll get back to that. That's part of the reason you're feeling drained but there's an important caveat. Kathy's story is a little bit different. 
>> All my kids are out of the house and officially I'm the empty nester. I know my children are going, but did they have to take my energy, too? 
Dr. Oz: I love that, that kids took your energy. How has your energy been changing? 
>> I've noticed since the youngest has moved away from home that I'm tired more often. I was at a point earlier when the kids were at home, everything was great, you're busy, moving around all the time, you can't be tired. Now five years later my youngest is gone, she's been gone for a while. I'm tired all the time. My grandkids used to say grandma, please call daddy, I'm tired. I want to go home. Now they're looking at me saying, grandma, what's wrong with you? Why are you so tired ? It's got to be hormones, I'm getting older, I'm changing. I feel different. I want my energy back. 
Dr. Oz: Other than the fact that hormones change when you get older, what makes you connect it to hormones so clearly to your lack of energy? 
>> Because I've made changes in the way that I do things. I exercise. I've taken fatty foods out of my diet. I'm trying to find the things that bring me energy back and it's not happening. If I take a nap -- let's say that I lay down at 3:00 in the afternoon. When I wake up it's 7:30 the next morning. That's a major difference. I used to lay down for 30 minutes. Now if I lay down my day is over. 

[00:06:28]


Dr. Oz: The whole audience is nodding their head up and down. And you've tried a lot of things. 
>> Yes. 
Dr. Oz: Let's put all your energy problems into perspective. Thank you for sharing them with us so hostly. Julie, lack of energy, and that speaks too many of us. Causes you to snap at the people you love, your kids, your husband, an people you don't even know on the road. It makes you moody overall. 
>> Yes, definitely moody. 
Dr. Oz: Your story is a little different, ann. You feel like your anxiety is causing a lot of energy drain and you start the day off without feeling fully energized. 
>> I feel like I didn't even eep. 
Dr. Oz: Kathy, you say you wake up without energy. Although you think it's the hormones, it may be related to the fact that it's around the hormones, including the hormones. Age plays a role as well. Have I missed anything? Did I capture most of the stories? All right. So I want you to join me, if you don't mind. I'm going to walk through something. I'm going to show all three of you why your lack of energy may be rooted in the exact same problem. I want you to look at this big wall. And I've written on there "energy." I want this to represent the energy in your body. So, julie, when you feel stressed out, you get angry. 
>> Yes. 
Dr. Oz: That's interesting. When that happens, it's like you're flipping a switch, and that stress switch when it's flipped on turns on the energy in your body and in your case it results in some anger, because the stress goes with the anger, and that energizes you, causes that chain reaction, but just for a few seconds. And then it quickly begins to slip away, because it turns out that anger -- go ahead and do that. Pull those plugs out, because you're pulling the plug on your energy when you get angry. Fair enough? 
>> Fair enough. 
Dr. Oz: Let's shift gears to ann. You say you start off your day a little bit like this, without fully having the energy you want to have to start out with. It turns out the anxiety you're feeling in your life further depletes your life. They go together. Your mind is like a hamster on those little wheels and it's running as fast as it can and it wears you down. Go ahead and pull the plug on your energy, that's what anxiety is doing to you. It's the reason you're waking up without feeling fully charged. When you pull the plug further during a day of being anxious, you have a little bit of energy left at the bottom of your reservoir. That leads me to kathy who wakes up with not much energy. 

[00:08:58]


>> Right. 
Dr. Oz: Feeling like this. You have little or no energy in part because of the hormones, and I think you're absolutely right about that. Go ahead and show me how hormones pulled the plug on your energy and leave you with no energy whatsoever. I'm tackling this topic today because it's a topic you have written me about the most this year. And this is exactly why it's such a big issue, because all of your problems are ones we all have. We all have a little bit of stress in life, we all have anxieties when we're worried about stuff, we all have changes happening in our bodies, some from hormones and some from other factors that aren't as predictable. If it wasn't for your kids and it wasn't for your anxiety and wasn't for your hormones, the question is, would your energy be better? And I think it might be a bit better, but there is something that is much larger even out there that most of us have missed. One fix that could help all three of your energy problems and you can start using it today to get re-energized today. Are you interested? 
>> Yes. 
>> Yes, very interested. 
Dr. Oz: When we come back, the number-one thing you need to end your exhaustion. You don't want to miss it. 
[Applause] 
>> coming up -- 
>> are you ready. 
>> What you need for energy and why you may not be getting enough. 
>> Your body is crying to you for help. 
>> The deficiency making you tired. 
>> Three out of four of you watching right now, I bet all of you are as well. 

[00:12:50]


>> Without the energy I feel out of it. It's like I'm running on auto pilot. Help, dr. Oz. 
Dr. Oz: I asked america for their biggest complaint and energy topped the list. There's one thing you're missing and it may explain why you're exhausted all the time. Are you ready? 
>> I'm ready. 
Dr. Oz: It's all about this. Magnesium. Magnesium. Look at that carefully. Now, you may not think it's a big deal, but it is. There are over 300 chemical reactions in your body that are dependent on magnesium. When it's not working, because you don't have enough in your body, you body becomes like sludge. Those reactions don't help get the energy you need into the right places. In fact, you don't even make the energy. Three out of four of you watching right now across this great country are not getting the amount of magnesium that you need and you are magnesium deficient. That number surprises me. Imagine, three out of four of us are deficient. It also surprised world researchers looking at this topic as well. None of us had any idea it was such a big problem. And having low energy levels is perhaps the strongest indication that you don't have adequate magnesium levels. Having lots of stress, having g the inability to get the things done in your life. Not having the pep that you had with your grappedkids, not being able to -- grandkids, nod being able to keep up withhe anxiety, including the road rage. But let's look at other signs of magnesium deficiency. I'm curious if you can find yourselves. The first one irritability. The second one is anxiety. Can you imagine something like that causing something like a headache? And the third is let ar gee. You tried a -- lethargy. You tried a lot of things, but sometimes there are fundamental things we overlook. When you get anxious, tell me what happens in your body, what does it feel like? 

[00:14:57]


>> My heart starts to pound, my hands get clammy, I can't keep a thought together, I feel like everything is going so fast for me. 
Dr. Oz: Step over here. I have a demonstration that might explain why it could be a magnesium deficiency. Part of the reason magnesium is so important is that if you don't have enough your body can't breathe, it can't process stuff. Unscrew that. Your body naturally all day long is using up its magnesium. It uses it for all kinds of processes, you pee it out, chemical reactions, all that stuff. When that happens you move from the green area into the red area. And anxiety is one of those signs again. Magnesium goes so low that you no longer has what your body needs. When it gets to a certain level you get into danger spot because your heart can't keep up. Your heart normally only has to beat at a certain pace. When your level drops too low it has to go fast like this, pitter-patter, pitter-patter, and, bam! You're back on that hamster wheel we talked about earlier, and you'll feel that in your body. Your body is crying to you for help. But we have not been able to, until today, to listen and hear what it was trying to tell us, to interpret with that sign meant to us. Studies have shown that when you don't have adequate magnesium levels, even a little bit of activity like running after your kids will get your heart to pump faster and your body is struggling to get more blood into it. 
>> Yes, that's how I feel. I feel like I can't catch my breath or anything, I get very anxious. 
Dr. Oz: So I want you to remember this. The question is, what are you going to do about it? Well, obviously to get your energy going, you need some mag knees yul. Go ahead and pour that in there. As you pow magnesium back that your body you will take yourself out of the red zone where most of us live today and into that robust area of greenness where we don't feel the lethargy or the irritability. Now, there's a point I've got to make here and this is really important. To do this you've got to do it consistently during the day. Kathy, you said you've done just about anything. And you listed off a cascade of events. Do you take a multivitemib? 

[00:17:04]


>> I do take a multivitamin. I have not checked the mag knees yul level, but I take one. 
>> Very smart of you to say that. This is really cool. It turns out you can't take magnesium once a day. And most multivitamins won't have it in there anyway because it makes the pill too large. So you have to take magnesium in food. It is the best way to maintains your reservoirs. You eat food all day long, most of us. But you have to eat the right kinds of food. When we come back I'm going to show you exactly what you have to get into your diet every single days in ways you cannot miss from now on. So stick with us.

>> Dr. Oz, I have five kids. No hitting. I'm exhausted from the minutes I wake up to the moment I go to sleep. I need you to get my energy back. 
[Cheers and applause] 
dr. Oz: We're back talking about your energy and why magnesium is so important for maintaining it. Before we get started, let me ask all three of you, julie and kathy, you eat three balanced meals a day? 
>> No. 
>> No. 
>> No. 
Dr. Oz: Why not? Why don't you? 
>> I don't have a second to spare getting the three of them ready. There's no way. 

[00:21:15]


>> Same thing. I don't make time because I'm so busy. 
>> I'm in the house alone. I don't need to cook three times a day anymore. 
>> The kids are gone, that's right. It's important that your diet contains the proper amount of magnesium. To get your daily amount of magnesium, all you have to do is use my magnesium must-have grocery list. I want you to eat five servings of these magnesium-rich foods throughout the day to get the daily amount you need. A half a cup of spinach, a half a cup of quinoa, a cup of black beans, kidney beans, lentz ills, raisin bran, two slices of whole wheat bread or two bananas. I want you each to pick the foods that you love most. As you do that, let me give you a couple of tims. You don't want to eat them all in one meal. Because, again, you won't have it the rest of the day. You can get one food five times a day, or five different foods, but you have to spread it out across the day to do it right. Have you all chosen what you love? You've only chosen two foods. 
>> Yeah. 
Dr. Oz: So you're going to eat that all day long. 
>> Yeah. 
Dr. Oz: That's fine. If you are diversify it might make life more fun, but two foods are fine. You can spread them out during the day. I notice here, ann, you don't have a breakfast food. 
>> No. 
Dr. Oz: One little tip, at least get one food that cou be breakfast and get started in the right direction. Kealt, you did a great job there. That's all easy to spread out. You've got to take these for a week. That's my only request of you. Do this for a week. It takes a week to rebuild your energy stores, to recharge those chemical systems. It depends on your magnesium. I can't do it all. I won't be there with you all the time, so I don't want to mess this up. But I'll be with us in spirit. Next time you're driving along in the southern state, you get angry in the car, let's face it. You need to attach these to your rear-view mirror as a reminder to take your magnesium and keep you calm. And the next time you feel anxious with the kids, -- my kids are horrified by this. Just a reminder to take your magnesium, an finally, kathy, first thing in the morning and last thing at night. Get your magnesium husband-have list at doctoroz.Com. He's a youtube sensation.

dr. Oz: Everyone wanted to have my next guest on their show. But he's here today to talk to me. You've seen him on youtube reviewing foods from the front seat of his car. Damian patterson has taken the internet by storm. People are following his every bite and he doesn't hold back when it comes to talries or his opinions. He's the toughest critic I've ever seen. 
>> What's going on? It's your boy, damian, on another super review. Rye bread, swiss cheese, double the turkey. Woo-hoo! The cheese is oozing out my burger. Let's get into it, because I'm really hungry. All right. We might be -- all right, i don't do fruit. Mmm. Uh-huh. I love you. This is going to be a mess, this is going to be a hot mess. There's no way I can make this really look pretty the way I'm about to tear into it. 
Dr. Oz: I got to say, i absolutely adore those videos. You're so passionate about every detail that you describe what's going in your mouth. Where did you get that from? 
>> I mean, it started at an early age. Mom, she loves cooking in the kitchen. So from the very beginning it was always about food. After that I kind of just took off, because I don't cook in the kitchen. Fast food is everywhere, baby. It's on the corner, across the street from every job. I'm will all over it. 
>> I see what you eat and I see how much you eat and I'm wondering, has it affected your health at all? 
>> It has, it has. I remember in the beginning -- I have two daughters, one that's 15, one is about to be a mom. The one that was 15, when she was firstborn, I was very active and she was coming did you -- we were coming up together. She's running across the floor, I'm dashing across the floor with her. Then we were at the playground. Here we are years later and now my second daughter is about to be a month old and in the back of my mind, can I do the same thing? No, because now it's the shortness of breath. Enough I can't make the same things happen. If it's going to be jumping over a fence, I can watch her. If it's dashing across the field, I can watch her dash across the field, but now I'm walking, now I'm slowing down, so I have to make a change. 

[00:29:53]


Dr. Oz: Is that why you came on the show today? 
>> That's exactly why I came on the show today. 
Dr. Oz: Thank you for trusting me with this. I have never met anyone like damian who could get a message across to people who we think want our help. I don't have the voice to get there, but you do. So I wanted to see if damian had the same passion for healthy fast food as you have for some of the other stuff you've been getting. So I've asked you, an you've kindly done this, to eat and review my fast-food picks for three days. Up next, how is his fast food helping his health? Can my diet work for him and for you? That's next.

Dr. Oz: I'm back with fast food critic david paterson whose youtube food reviews have gone viral in a big way. He's accepted my challenge to eat and review my healthy fast foods for three full days. Here are the rules. Each meal is under 500 calories, zero trans fat and less than 1,000 milligrams of sodium or salt. I sent him a illegals of approved drive-through -- a list of approved drive-through option. 
>> Here's my weekend challenge. For breakfast you wamentsed me to do egg whites with turkey sausage on flatbread. Is this what my weekend challenge is going to look like? This is day two. We have a grilled chicken, a three-inch corn on the cob and our green beans. And we'll start with the corn, because she's out here looking sexy. The greens are what's happening, baby, the greens are what's happening. This I day three. I'm hungry. I'm not going to lie to you, bro, I'm stafferinging. 
-- Starving. Tonight I get a six-inch oven-grilled chicken on whole wheat. Here we go. 
[Applause] 
dr. Oz: I want some honesty here. How hard was that? Did any of my selections stack up to some of the things you normally eat? 
>> Changing the way that I was eating breakfast, lunch, dinner, I wasn't ready for it. I didn't want to do it. I'm looking at what you're giving me and I'm thinking, he must be a little crazy. Let me look at this again, you know? But there were a few different options that were there that i figured would actually work for me. Surfs willing to try it. Here we are -- so I was willing to try it. 
Dr. Oz: Thanks for giving it a college try. I made a list of the foods from the major fast food chains. We'll put it up here. Let's start with breakfast. Which of the breakfasts that we gave you was your favorite? 

[00:36:31]


>> Subway hands down, hands down. Let me tell you about it. Egg whites, american cheese, nine-grain wheat bread. Give me a minute, give me a minute. And I'm thinking to myself -- the egg white is what threw me off. Where's the rest of my egg? 
[Laughter] what am I supposed to do with this? I had to look at the bread, i put it back down, I looked at it again. He's playing on my emotions. What am I supposed to do with this? But I took a bite and it was like a little bliss, with a little bit of heaven just kind of wrapped in my mouth and slid its way down my throat. Pure satisfaction, baby, and i had to love it, I had to love it, I had to love it. 
[Applause] 
dr. Oz: Here's the good news from my perspective. 320 calories and only three grams of saturated fat. We can both live with that. 
>> I can live with it. 
Dr. Oz: Let's move to lunch. Of the long list that I gave you, and there are quite a few there, what was your favorite lunch? 
>> Mcdonald people upcaesar salad, grilled chicken and sliced apples. I put the apples in the salad and made that happen. Because lettuce -- if I have to fall back on the lettuce, i can't. I tried to make it happen with the lettuce and the salad. I took a bite and my stomach was like, whoa, and I was like, oh, hold on, let me think about it. But then I tossed the apple in there, tried it again and it was a little bit better. Wasn't exactly great, but it was definitely better. 
Dr. Oz: It will grow on you. 
>> It's going to have to grow on moe. 
Dr. Oz: You can get a 205 
-calorie course at fast food restaurant. For a big guy like you, you can have two of these things if you can get used to the taste. 
>> You said two? 
Dr. Oz: Yeah, you can have two. All right. And it's a good non-fried option, too, which is what i like about it. Dinner time. Again, I gave you a lot of drive-through options here. What was your favorite one? 

[00:38:39]


>> Boston market. Now, again, I was looking at different dinners and I was like boston market, I've been there before. I think they're a little bit different. 
Dr. Oz: I can imagine. 
>> The steamed vegetables, that's something completely new for me. That took me a minute. I sat there and I probably cried and then I cut -- got myself together. I took a bite of the broccoli and it did not bite mack. I need something to bite back. That's how I know it's superficial. It wasn't, but I knew it was healthier. Every bite I took I thought of my little girls. 
Dr. Oz: Exactly right, exactly right. 
[Applause] I want to ask one last question. Of all the things I gave you, what was the worst meal that you found? 
>> Am I allowed to say it on tv? 
>> You've got to. 
>> Ok, I went to dunkin' donuts. I love dunkin' donuts. We have a long-standing relationship of happiness and bliss. You had given me on my list an option to get egg whites with turkey sausage on flatbread. 
Dr. Oz: It sounds good. 
>> I'm sure it probably did to you. It didn't sound so good to me. But when I took a bite, it was extremely dry. I got caught in my throat. It stopped right here, so I had to drink some water, but it stayed right here. It didn't work for me, it didn't work for me. 
Dr. Oz: Fair enough. Listen. I have put you through this experiment not just to help a lot of people understand how a great critic of fast food might pick the best things, but also to help you. Because I've been talking a little bit about you with your family and about your eating hacts. And valerie, who's joining us today, they've been talking to you about your eating habits. Your mom has most of your life I understand. So mom, if I could, why is it so important to you that we're talking together? 
>> First of all, my son, my baby, love hick dearly, I want him to eat healthier. We have diabetes in my family, high blood pressure, high cholesterol and I don't want that to happen to him. Right now he's ok as far as that goes, but as his weight goes up higher and higher with the way he's been eating, i know he's going to run into all those issues, and I don't want that for hill. I want to see him last longer for his beautiful two daughters, his new wife. I just want him to be around, dr. Oz, really. 

[00:41:09]


[Applause] 
>> whoo! I'm good. 
Dr. Oz: We can stay over here much moms have an impact on us, don't they? 
>> Yeah. . Oz: They have adoring, raw love, which is what I love about this program, and I love the fact that you made this all happen, mom. So here's the thing. You've proven that you can do this for other people, and that advice that you give is going to influence millions. But we're doing this show to figure out how someone like you can carry that banner forward. And you've proven that in a three-day period you can make healthy choices. It's survivable. But I want to get into your body. I want to tease what's happening inside of you so we're all on the same page of what's going to happen, because it's not just about your weight, it's about the other things that are happening inside of you at your young age. When we come back we'll put you in the truth tube. 
>> All right. 
Dr. Oz: We'll be right back. 
[Applause] love.

dr. Oz: I'm back with youtube sensation damon patterson, who, like you, loves fast food but is ready to turn his health around. Earlier you told me that you want to change your health. We've talked about your beautiful kids, wife, your mom's here, you've got a family history. I want to show you why it's so important you do it now. And the best and most honest way to do that is to put you in the truth tube. Do you want to take that long walk over there with me? 
>> Let's make it happen. 
Dr. Oz: Again, I'm going t give you the information. Hop up there. As I see it as a physician, as someone who's going to try and give you support on this. The first thing we look for, because you can do it at home as well, is your weight. And you got up on the scale today and we weighed you. 394 pounds. You're a big guy. Re nervous about that number? 
>> Very, very nervous. 
Dr. Oz: So a lot of times folks will say, well, you know, I'm 6'5", whi is what you are. So it's not as bad as it sounds. We looked at your body mass index. 47. 47 puts you in the super obese category. Not the overweight or the obese category, but the super obese category. And it puts you there for an important reason, because we know that the complications that come about, especially if that lot of that weight is in your midsection will droy the key factors that keep you young. The first of those is blood pressure. Number one cause of aging. We never want that to get above 140 over 90, ideally it's 115 over 75. Your blood pressure is 164 over 96. Now, I could send you off and put you on medication, and that's what we do a lot in america. But that's not what I'm about. I'm about figuring out what you can do for you so you can fix this without having to see me or someone like me. We do this together, I'm just going to be there as a coach supporting you. But I want you to lead the way for a lot of folks who see themselves in you and say that's my story right now. I'm watching what damon is going through and I'm living exactly the same thing. Are you in? 

[00:46:59]


>> Let's do this. 
>> I've got one question for you, and this is an important one. It's the only question I need to ask today before we go on. You're a smart guy. I want you to move out of your head and move into your heart and tell me why you're going to change. 
>> My biggest motivation to make these changes, that's my family, you know? Again, I have a 15-year-old. My baby is about to be a mom. They need their father there. I mean, I can see the years of them getting older, and with me missing in their presence. I'm not going to be the individual missing. 
Dr. Oz: You're going to show up in their lives. 
[Applause] that's one heck of a bear hug, by the way, in case you're all interested. For everyone like damon and all the other folks out there who are thinking about whether they can make she is decisions or not, I want to take you through some tips that I would use in the drive-through. Road rule number one is eat whatever you want, but start with a side salad or a soup. If you fill up on these, you can eat less of that main dish, like the burger, for example. I mean, can you see yourself doing this? 
>> We talked about that salad. 
Dr. Oz: Forget the salad. 
>> Put it aside, put it aside. Let's hone in on the chili. I can see the chili happening. 
Dr. Oz: It's a good compromise. That's doable. Road rule number one. Road rule number two is the flavor elevators. This, my friend, is going to change your life. And that beautiful front seat of your car that I hope to ride in one day, I want you to take a couple of these flavor elevators. Blood pressure is a big problem for you. 
>> Yes. 
Dr. Oz: With those numbers and your young age. It really concerns me a lot. Salt drives that. These flavor elevators will allow you to take the salt out of your food and give you the same feeling of fullness that you want. You'll also eat less because they tend to satiate you more. Red pepper flakes, these are easy to carry around. Take these to the drive-through with you. Get a little packet of hot sauce if you forgot them. Take these spices. You know the french fries that you so beautifully and elegantly described in the camera? You want them to bite you back in have your verbiage, right? You put this spice on top of it and eat it that way. I've never said you can eat french fries before on the show. It's the first time ever. I'm doing it for you. If you start in that direction you'll head off the right way. Now step forward with me. The last tip, rule number three, is to chew for 10. What do I mean by that? A lot of us don't realize that fast food means that it comes to you fast. We think it means we eat it fast, right? We wolf it down. All I want you to do is get the food fast and then slow down as you eat it. I want you to take 10 seconds to eat the food. I want you to slow yourself down. This rule of 10 will be valuable because you can do it any time you put anything in your mouth and it will help you to savor the calories. The food will taste good, you'll be more aware of it and you'll naturally pull back because you'll feel that you got what you wanted. Is that doable? Del that's doable. 

[00:50:37]


Dr. Oz: If you do these three things you're headed in the right direction in a very, very fast way and you'll be a role model to a lot of people. I'm going to ask you a huge favor. I would love you to make one of your videos once a month going through a drive-through picking out a healthy meal and post it for me and our site, doctoroz.Com and together the two of us can get a lot of people to realize, you know what, I can be into my food, i can love my food, and I can do what damon is doing, too. >> I'm going to take that challenge, and I ask only one thing of you in t return. We're going to make this happen right here on yo set, ready? 
Dr. Oz: I'm waiting. 
>> In all my videos for me to give passion to anything, i only have two words and it's superficial. Can we do superficial together? On the counts of three. On one, two, three. Super official.

dr. Oz: Now today we talked a lot about how to get more energy. But there's another issue i know is bothering a lot of you because you're always sending me questions on facebook and twitter about them. Here's what sonia said about her constipation. Dr. Oz, no matter how hard i try I can't keep myself regular. I've tried everything from raisins to laxatives, but nothing seems to work. By the end of the week I am in agony. I need help. That's from sonia. Now, if I just read your complaint and you're out there, come join me. There she is. 
>> Hi. 
Dr. Oz: It is such a pleasure to meet you. 
>> You, too. Thank you. 
Dr. Oz: You're concerned about writing to me about your constipation? 
>> Yes, dr. Oz. I stand on my feet 10, 12 hours a day. In the morning I try to eat yogurt in the morning, I have fruit, I have a protein shake and by the end of the week I'm still consty pated. And it never, ever happens until normally the end of the week. 
>> So the beginning of the week is fine? 
>> The beginning of the week is ok. 
Dr. Oz: So that's interesting. On fridays toward the ends of the week do you go to the bathroom at all? 
>> No, I realize by the ends of the week I'm like, hey, i haven't been to the bathroom at all. 
Dr. Oz: You just notice that? I haven't been in three weeks? 
>> I don't go every day. 
Dr. Oz: Do you go every other day? 
>> Sometimes. 
Dr. Oz: Sometimes. 
Dr. Oz: So when you haven't gone at least once every two days, what does it feel like when it comes out? 
>> Oh, my gosh, plop, plop, plop. 
[Laughter] 
dr. Oz: No splish splashing, just plop-plop and you're done? Here's the thing. I've got something that will relieve the brick that you feel like you have in your belly, and it's surprising, in part because it has so much fiber in it. I like rs berries. One cup of raspberries has about one cup of fiber. A lot of folks think if they take extra fiber it will do it for me. If you do it as a powder or do it every day, that would be great, but most people don't. If you do the raspberries every day, make it part of your routine, or do it with the yogurt. The bacteria in there will wake up their system. We prescribe it for patients who have irritable bowel, it wakes everything up and makes it seem like they're heading in the right direction. 

[00:57:44]


>> Do I have to eat like this whole thing in a day? 
Dr. Oz: You can't do that in a day? Do you like raspberries? 
Dr. Oz: This is it. 
>> T is a normal portion every day? 
Dr. Oz: Normal portion. Any other complaints I'm here to listen. Let me know what's bothering you on. Until next time. Cred cre captioned by the national captioning institute

=======================================================

>>> You can cut tax rates by 20% and still preserve these important preferences for middle class taxpayers. 

[00:03:35]


>> It is not possible -- 
>> it is mathematically possible. 
>> It has been done a couple of times. 
>> Jack kennedy -- 
>> oh, now you're jack kennedy. 
>> I sat down with the vice president, joe biden, and we sat down and talked about americans and principles. 
>> It is great to be here, I'm a fan. 
>> Thank you, my head explodes when I hear you can't raise taxes on the job creators. What goes through your mind? 
>> What goes through my mind is where in the heck have these guys been? That was the same argument listening on the senate floor, that george bush made, put that god-awful tax breakor the super wealthy, without paying for it. They were going to create jobs. What happened? A slower job growth rate in 50 years once that passed. 
>> Do you think this is an instant replay? 
>> I don't know, they talk about out of touch. Haven't they seen this movie? I mean, what makes anybody think? Look, all this done is the god-awful tax cuts that romney wants to put in there, $250,000 a year tax cut for the average person making over a million bucks on top of the bush tax cuts? 800 billion -- 
>> can't do it, doesn't work. 
>> By the way, it doesn't work, if we want to give incentive to businesses, we should give tax breaks to the innovative ones, investing in manufacturing capabilities, alternative energy. 
>> So the romney camp is saying that 92% of the jobs that were lost during the recession were with women, what is your response to that? 
>> You know what that reminds me of. I used to practice law when i was a kid. It is that old joke about the kid who kills both parents and then pleads for mercy because he is an orphan? What caused all of these jobs to be lost, before then? Men and women. Before we came into office, 3.5 million jobs were lost. Before I lowered my right hand on that magnificent day on JANUARY 20th, WITH A MILLION People watching, 750,000 lost. Another four million before the first job bill we could get passed. 

[00:06:08]


>> He is trying to make the case that women have been inordinarily hit during this recession, is that true explosive. 
>> Well, women and men have been hit. Look at the number of people that were kicked out of the middle class, dropped out because they can't stay there anymore. These guys talking about women, these guys talking about women. These guys have a social policy on contraception that takes you BACK TO THE '50s. When asked the question do you think the legislation passed mandating that your son and daughter doing the same work will have to get the exact same pay, the lilly ledbetter law? They couldn't answer. 
>> So the war on women is real? 
>> Oh, I think the war on women is real. And will get more intense. The next president of the united states is going to get to name one and possibly two or more members of the supreme court. 
>> Are women going to be with you in this legislation -- i mean, the polls show right now there is a gender gap and it favors the democrats? 
>> I, you know -- I'm a little probably -- unusual in this regard. I never predict what people are going to do. All I'm saying is I think the case that we can make, barack obama's policies are passed, our expectations, our dreams for women, contrasted with the republican agenda as it has been and continues to be relative to women, I don't think it is a close call. 
>> Okay. 
>> And I think women will make that judgment. 
>> Let's get back to the economy for just a moment. A white house campaign staff member told me yesterday that 67% of the american people want the wealthy to pay more. Do you believe that number? And do you think the people are with you on that? 
>> Absolutely, look, I come from a wealthy state of little delaware, and got elected seven times in the state being a progressive. And I never once engaged in the so-called class war fare. Because I found out, and you know as I do, wealthy people are just as patriotic as lower class and middle class people. 

[00:08:28]


>> You said they're ready to do more. 
>> I remember looking at a poll, we were trying to get the jobs bill passed. And we said in order to put 400,000 teachers and teachers aides, and firefighters and cops all you had to do was raise 5/10th OF 1%, I REMEMBER THE Majority of the millionaires supported that. So I just think these guys, i just -- I think the american public is ready to step up and do their fair share, including millionaires. 
>> Citizens united. There is a very good chance that the obama campaign won't match the money that is going to be RAISED BY THE SUPER PACs. 
>> There is a goo chance -- 
>> well, and the template may be played out in wisconsin, about boots on the ground, social -- how important is that recall, for the confidence that people want to have in their government and want to have a voice? 
>> In a sense, I think it has already been accomplished, and given confidence. You have an overwhelming majority of the people in wisconsin saying we should have a recall vote. It almost at this point doesn't matter who wins the vote. It matters. But the point has been made. It was not just democrats or union members who voted for that. In order to get to the numbers they had if my recollection is correct as many people voted in that as voted for governor. The previous election. Saying there should be a recall election. And that is people standing up. 
>> Is this the template? 
>> It is, I just got finished talking to the volunteers here in new hampshire. And I said there is only one real antidote to what is expected for the hundreds of millions of dollars spent, the carpetbombing, the president is the guy he will go after because he is the leader, the boss. I said there is only one antidote, it is your next door neighbor knocking on your door saying I know these guys. Let me tell you, ed, they're good men. That is not true. That is why we need more people. Barack obama, his last campaign had the best organized campaign in the history modern presidential politics. Put more troops on the ground. The best anti-negative advertising is people on the ground. And I believe we'll have the best ground game on the ground. 

[00:11:04]


>> Do you like "the ed show". 
>> I tell you what, I watch it, I like it. We came from the same backgrounds, you ended up being an all-american, I ended up being an all-nothing when i tried to play. 
>> I don't think so. Mr. Vice president, thank you, appreciate it. 
>>> Coming up, one woman became the target of oneof the biggest voices in the republican party. The fallout sent out a central debate about women's rights in america. We'll show you how it all happened. Stay tuned. flo? is? Are you flo? Yes. Is this the thing you gave my husband? Well, yeah, yes. The "name your price" tool. You tell us the price you want to pay, and we give you a range of options to choose from. Careful, though -- that kind of power can go to your head. That explains a lot. Yo, buddy! I got this. Gimme one, gimme one, gimme one! The power of the "name your price" tool. Only from progressive. 

[00:13:41]


>>> Coming up, it was the tape that everybody was talking about. We'll look at how mitt romnmney's 47% changed the race. 
>>> And we'll look at long lines, americans faced many obstacles to cast their votes, ohio senator nina turner talks with me about the fight for the right to vote. And a salute to the middle class heros. 
>>> Welcome back to "the ed show." Equal pay for equal work, birth control, those were the issues that republicansecided to tackle in 2012. It was the year in which republicans at the state level tried to force women considering an abortion to have an invasive and unnecessary ultrasound. Some required women to view the ultrasound. Republican tim corbitt didn't understand what it was all about. 

[00:16:01]


>> I don't know how you can make anybody watch. Okay, because you just have to close your eyes. 
>> It was a year in which there was campaigning on defunding planned parenthood. Wouldn't take a position on the lilly ledbetter fair pay act, and bragged about his hiring as governor of massachusetts. 
>> And we took a concerted effort to go out and find women who could become a member of the cabinet, I went to a group of women, they brought us binders full of women. 
>> It was the year in which republicans pushed for extremist candidates like todd akin and murdoch. 
>> The female body has ways to shut that down. 
>> I came to realize life is a gift from god, and I think even when life begins in that horrible situation of rape that it is something that god intended to happen. 
>> It was a year in which we had to hear rhetoric like this. 
>> This contraception thing, it is so inexpensive, in my day, they used bayer aspirin, it was not that costly, the gals put it between their knees. 
>> When the republicans heard on the affordable care act, no women testified. Democrats were allowed to invite one witness. They chose majority law student sandra fluk, darrell issa judged her to be not qualified to speak on the matter. She later gave her testimony in front of the panel, and became a target of the biggest voice of the republican party, rush limbaugh. But before rush limbaugh could launch his campaign, she gave her first interview here on "the ed show". 

[00:18:02]


>> Great to have you here, i understand you had planned to have your testimony, you were going to cite some examples of people who could have benefitted from president obama's mandate of birth control coverage. Share with us what you would have told that committee today. 
>> That is what I was there to speak to the committee about. And that is why I was so stunned when chairman issa made the decision to not allow me to speak on behalf of those women, and to say that I was not an appropriate witness. That those women's stories were not appropriate for this committee. I cannot think of who would be more appropriate for the committee to hear from, than the women who are affected by this policy whose lives were affected. One of the women I wanted to talk about today is a close friend of mine. She has ovarian syndrome, and what that means is she needs to take contraception for medical reasons to stop cysts from growing on her ovaries, and not prevent pregnancy. Unfortunately, when university administrators and employers and insurance companies get involved in deciding whose health needs are legitimate and whose aren't, what happens is that women's health needs take a bk seat to that type of ideology. That happened in her case, and we found it happened in 65% of the student's cases. So for her, she was unable, they repeatedly refused her contraception coverage claims. She had verification from her doctor, it didn't matter. She had to p out of pocket for her, month after month after month, and eventually she just couldn't afford it, like many students just cannot afford that kind of a cost. And she had to stop taking it. I have to tell you, it is so -- what happened is that after a few months of her not taking the prescription, a masscyst grew on her ovary. And she woke up one night in the middle of the night in terrible pain. She told me that it felt like she had been shot. And I don't want to imagine what that felt like for her. But what ultimately happened is that she had that ovary removed. She had to have it surgically removed. And as a result of that, of course she would have problems conceiving a problem. But even more, it just -- it has not stopped for her. She -- she, since the surgery, has experienced the symptoms of early menopause. And her doctors are very concerned that at the age of 32 she is entering early menopause, which means that there is nothing doctors can do to help her conceive a child. She will be at further risk for cancer, heart disease and osteoporosis. And that is where she was this morning when I was attempting to tell her story in front of members of congress. She was at the doctor's, trying to cope with the symptoms she was experiencing. 

[00:21:18]


>> Are people on campus, is this really hitting the attention of women you interact with professionally in the school setting? 
>> Oh, my goodness, unless you study at one of these schools i cannot even explain to you what it is like on campus. We have been following the regulations ever since the affordable care act was passed. It is a fight we have been fighting for years, literally for decades they have been struggling. This has made so much difference for us. 
>> Sandra fluk, I appreciate you being here tonight. I know they watch on capitol hill. And I think you will be in a position to talk with others who make decisions that affect the lives of women, I really appreciate you being here tonight. 
>> Thank you for having me. 
>> You bet. 
>> Mitt romney's caught on tape comments, reveal his true feelings about the poor in the country. 
>>> And how the 47% change the way the race went. And how to keep jobs as republicans try to dismantle labor unions. And much more, stay tuned. 

[00:26:05]


>>> Welcome back to "the ed show." One video defined the campaign mo than anything else. Mitt romney and the 47%. 
>> Don't worry, we'll take care of it. How are we going to do it? To convince everybody they have to -- 
>> well, there are 47% of the people who will vote for the people, no matter what. All right? There are 47% of people who are with him, depend on government, who believe they are victims. Who believe the government has a responsibility to care for them. Who believe they're entitled to health care, to food, to housing. To you name it. It is an entitlement, and government should give it to them. And they will vote for this president no matter what. And the president starts off with 48, 49 -- he starts off with a huge number. These are people who pay no income tax, 47% of the americans pay no income tax, so our message of low taxes doesn't connect, he will be out there talking about taxes for the rich. And so my job is not to worry about those people. They will never take personal responsibility, what I have to do is convince the 5 or 10% that are independents, that are thoughtful, look at emotions. 
>> Does mitt romney really think that people in this country want to be on medicare, that they want to be poor, or be disabled? That they want thave assistance? Is that really the path that he thinks americans want to take? And most americans, I believe tonight, especially the liberals will be absolutely offended by the comment "my job is not to worry about them. I'll never be convinced that they will take personal responsibility and care for their lives." Personal responsibility, those of you who are in nursing homes, who are in wheelchairs, those of you who depend on assistance by the government because we are a government of compassion. We have always been a country of compassion. But all of a sudden the republicans are putting up a candidate who wants to wipe away that, because we want to privatize everything. The obama campaign has also responded. It is shock can that a candidate for president of the united states would go behind closed doors and declare to a group of rich donors that half of the american people view themselves as victims, entitled to handouts and are unwilling to take personal responsibilities for their lives. It is hard to serve as president for all americans when you disdainfully have written off half of the nation. And that is exactly what mitt romney has done with this statement here of behind closed doors. For months on this program, i have asked will mitt romney please stand up? In this video, behind closed doors, we did see the real mitt romney, he did stand up. He doesn't give a damn about the people, we are a society, it cuts to the fabric, we are a country of compassion that we want to help people who are downtrodden, people who have been dealt a tough deck of cards. Whether it be the economy or health care, or through no fault of their own. Circumstances put on families that are totally out of their control. Mitt romney views them as road kill. And he is not even going to communicate to them or offer up a better plan to make their lives better. He just says they should be personally responsible for who they are, and where they are in america. But romney made the matters only worse for himself. 

[00:29:47]


>> It is not elegantly stated, let me put it that way. I'm speaking off the cuff in response to a question, I'm sure, I could state it more clearly and effectively than i in, in -- in a setting like that, we don't even have the question, given the snippet or the full response, I hope the person who has the video will put out the full material. 
>> Wait a minute, don't have the question, just the snippet, we played the full question and answer on the program last night. And we were not alone in doing so. President obama's supporters were surprised when the president didn't mention romney's 47% remarks in the first debate. But president obama made up for the later in the second debate, on the final question when romney could not respond, president obama got the final say on the 47%. 
>> When he said behind closed doors that 47% of the country consider themselves victims? Who refuse personal responsibility? Think about who he was talking about. Folks on social security who have worked all their lives. Veterans, who sacrificed for this country. Students, who are out there trying to hopefully advance their own dreams but also this country's dreams. Soldiers who are overseas fighting for us right now. People who are working hard every day, paying payroll tax, gas taxes, but don't make enough income. And I want to fight for them. That is what I have been doing for the last four years, because if they succeed I believe the country succeeds. 
>> There is a lot more coming up in the next half hour of "the ed show." Stay tuned. 
>> I just have to say what we should not be doing is take away your rights to bargain for better working rights. 
>> In 2012, president obama came up big for workers, but not before the workers came up big for him. John nicoles of the nation magazine on the year in labor, next. 

[00:31:54]


>> Voter idea is going to allow governor romney to win the state of pennsylvania, done. 
>> And in 2012, republicans thought they could suppress their way to the white house. But the voters would not be denied. 
>> We will not be turned around.

>>> Good to have you back with us, thank you for joining us on this special year-end edition of "the ed show." We covered worker's issues all year long, but we wondered how the middle class voters would do coming out to vote. The victory was never a sure thing for president obama. The story I think starts with workers in wisconsin in 2011. Let's roll it back, republican governor scott walker threatened to destroy collective bargaining in the state. Workers exchanged massive protests and launched the first recall in the state's history. We cover the recall from madison. 
>> We have already seen a ground operation unlike anything in the wisconsin history. 
>> What we see here in wisconsin is something that is proving to be far more powerful than money. And that is the power of the people. 
>> Of course, governor scott walker survived the recall, republican operatives were delighted. They claimed this was the end of organized labor. 
>> It is a blow for organized labor, particularly organized labors represented in public employee unions. Make bolder similar unions in other states by other governors. Clearly it will put wisconsin, in my opinion, into play. 
>> Karl rove, later taken off fox news, were all so wrong. The voters help to reelect president obama. Tammy baldwin defeated tommy thompson by five points. Turns out labor is alive and well. In fact, workers across america help us understand what mitt romney could mean for the economy. 
>> This is "the ed show." Let's get to work. 

[00:37:09]


>> We followed the worker's stories to freeport, illinois in october. Bain capital has shut down the plant, and they were going to ship some 200 jobs to china. 
>> What would you say to mitt romney? 
>> The three of us here have been arrested defending american jobs, we're waiting, come out here and talk to us. 
>> You want to talk to him? What would you say to him? 
>> Save our jobs. 
>> Over the summer, more and more workers started to come forward with horror stories about bain capital and the bain economy. Workers there made national headlines. 
>> When you take all the good jobs we had here at gs steel in kansas city, the middle class will be extinction. 
>> It claimed jeep was moving to china because of the automobile loan, and it was totally false. It totally backfired on the camp. Auto workers and their families turned out in full force on election day. And of course, president obama won ohio. Middle class americans across this country stood in long lines to cast a vote for the candidate who would help them the most. They ignored the republican threats about a failing economy. The republicans wanted to kill organized labor. In 2012, they may have given it new life instead. Here is someone who has been with us all year long covering worker's issues. Joining me tonight, john nicoles, of the "washington correspondent" magazine. John, has labor been emboldened by the victory, and has there been a new stage set for what they can accomplish? 
>> I think so. I think labor changed over the last year and a half. And especially over the last year. One of the things is that it is safe to say that a lot of unions, not all of them but a lot were on auto pilot. They had a sense of how politics worked. And a sense of how government worked and they fit into that. What happened in wisconsin and ohio in 2011 forced unions to start to re-think, to start to recognize that there really were powerful forces out to get them. That made an awful lot of unions recognize that they had to fight for their livelihood, I think it made them leaner and meaner effective players. You start to win tough battles, as had happened in ohio other states, then you start to think about what you may be able to accomplish. Not in a defensive position, but in an affirmative position. 

[00:40:04]


>> Of course, they have been villified, others like karl rove are forceful on how they want to go after unions, to tear down the last great bastion of frurks for the democratic party, which is labor unions. But do you think it has woken up another level of americans that are not involved in organized labor? 
>> I think there is simply no question that is exactly what has happened. Because people who were never members of unions were out there in those demonstrations in michigan, in ohio, wisconsin, and places like new york city. And los angeles as part of the occupy movement. And more recently, as part of the protests against walmart. Art of the fast-food workers walkouts and strikes that have occurred. The fact of the matter is we have a new era for labor. And it is not fully defined. A lot of unions are starting to figure out how to work with people who are not members. A lot of people who are members of unions are trying to figure out how they would fit into a labor movement. A lot is going to change. But labor is no longer on auto pilot, it is affirmatively moving in a new area, changing politics and or work place. 
>> And if you look attacks 
-- at the tax policies the republicans, they want to favor the rich. Teachers, firefighters, this basilly set up the right wing back in 2011. 
>> You're so ed, in fact I reported with you on election night. I was in the teamster's hall in toledo, ohio, and off camera i would talk to the teamsters who were there, folks not just from that unions but from other unions. They said you know, we started working on this 2012 election, back in 2011. We recognized we were under assault. We couldn't just stop when we won a referendum or a single vote, we knew it was a long fight. 

[00:42:21]


>> All right, john nicoles, great to have you with us. Thanks so much. 
>>> Coming up, we discussed a lot of serious topics, but here at "the ed show," we still had time for laughs. Pr claims. flo. I need you. I feel so alone. But you're not alone. I knew you'd come. Like I could stay away. You know I can't do this without you. You'll never have to. You're always there for me. Shh! I'll get you a rental car. I could also use an umbrella. Fall in love with progressive's claims service. 
>>> Up next, coach ed, that would be me, gives the president a pep talk. And later, the republicans trying to block the vote and hand mitt romney a win on election night. 

[00:44:25]


>>> State senator nina turner joins me on the continued fight against voter suppression. . 

[00:46:39]


>>> Welcome back to "the ed show." The 2012 presidential campaign was intense, start to finish. But we here at the ed show took time to make fun of the candidates. During the new hampshire primary, tim pawlenty told me he couldn't stay awake long enough to watch "the ed show." The next night, we decided to give 2% timmy a sleep aid. 
>> Good night to unions, good night to health care, good night to jobs, good night clean air. Good night public education, good night immigration, goo night wall street regulation, good night middle class, good night auto czar, good night, dog on the car. Good night, roe v. Wade. Good night, marriage equality. Good night to the elderly whispering, don't privatize social security. Good night medicare, good night medicaid, good night american dreams everywhere. Sweet dreams, t-pa, sleep just as good as your presidential campaign. 
>> Oh, they're easy to pick on, good targets, don't you think? But just to be fair and balanced we had some fun with the president's first debate. The president was really off his game during december. So the very next night I had to give liberals some hope dur a post-game news conference. 
>> All right. Not a good night. We didn't play very well. Unusual for us. We're a hell of a team. We have a long way to go. I know you're not happy. I heard the fans, I heard it. And you're hearing it from me, we're better than that. 

[00:48:41]


>> The report card -- 
>> report card is fine, that is why we recruited him in 2007, he is a hell of a player, we have won championships, we'll win begin. 
>> Will there be a lineup change? 
>> No, there is not going to be a lineup, look, did he turn the ball over, yes, did he throw the ball out of bounds? Yes, did he miss a few lineups? He is still my guy, I'm not changing the lineup, I told you when you covered the team earlier this year, this is going to be a long road. I don't know about the altitude, everybody started, we didn't play very well. It is another game, we have to get overit. 
>> Coach, what about the other team. 
>> If you guys want to go out and crown them the champion you go right ahead and do it. But I think you would be making a huge mistake if you did that. You know what we got to do? We got to get to work. 
>> Well, we're not sure if president obama saw the press conference, but he sure did destroy romney in the next final two debates. 
>>> Coming up, long lines couldn't keep voters from casting their ballots, despite attempts to keep them from the polls. Next, nina turner, on the fight against voter suppression. 

[00:53:28]


>>> Welcome back to "the ed show." Leading up to the 2012 election, we saw efforts by the republicans to suppress the democratic vote. 18 states have passed some type of voter suppression law. Some of the toughest laws came out of the swing states, like ohio, pennsylvania, wisconsin and florida. In ohio, early voting hours were cut and new restrictions were put on absentee ballots. Down in florida, republicans put restrictions on voter registration, cut early voting hours, banned felons from voting for five years. And attempted to purge 180,000 voters from the state's voting rolls. Luckily after public outrage, the voter purge failed. Meanwhile, states like wisconsin put in strict photo laws. Pennsylvania's law was later ck down, but misleading signs and billboards like this one were put up to try and trick voters. These suppression efforts directly targeted minorities and low income voters, no doubt this was meant to help them vote for mitt romney. 
>> He is going to win the state of pennsylvania, done. 
>> Ohio county gop chair doug price put it this way, he said "we shouldn't contort the voting process to accommodate urban red afternoon-american turning out machines. Not accommodating voters led to record-long lines on election day. In the state of florida there were reports of people waiting in line as long as seven hours to vote. These voter suppression tactics must stop, and president obama said he wants action on it. 
>> Whether youed for the first time or waited in line for a very long time, by the way, we have to fix that. 

[00:55:31]


>> Yes. 
>> In the wake of all of this, california senator barbara boxer introduced the line act, which would require the election commission to set new standards by january 14. This commission would decide the voters, workers and other resources, the act would hopefully keep the voting lines one hour long. In the end, the voter suppression act didn't work. Tonight, we want to honor the huge numbers that came out, and waited to cast their votes in the states we're talking about. They didn't quit. And president obama came out with the win. I'm joined tonight with ohio state senator nina turner. Senator, good to have you with us. We cmmend you, you have been absolutely the stalwart fighter there in ohio, and a leader an inspirational in so many ways. What do you think the federal government can do to curb vot suppression? 
>> The federal government needs to enforce the voting rights act, the civil rights act and any other federal statutes on the books. There was a commission established called the election assistance commission. That was supposed to be a bipartisan commission with four members. It doesn't have meers because the republans have been holding that up in congress. It is very important that those on the federal level enforce the laws that we had there. And that elections assistance commission would go a long way, it would be a clearing house for some of the best practices in this nation that continue to drive the polls. That voting should be for everybody. Not a select few. And we need to make sure the federal government uses the tools that are in their tool box. 

[00:57:31]


>> And you say in your state of ohio, the republicans unfairly target the low income with voter suppression tactics. That is well documented. But if this line act was passed, that senator barbara boxer has put in place, would this really change some of the acts 
>> I commend senator boxer for standing up for all voters in this country. But ultimately, voters hold the key. And voters have got to continue to vote for policy-makers and executives who respect the power of the vote and not try to suppress it. So even though the feds need to do their job, senator boxer, i give a big shout out to her. We need to empower voters, and now that the bright, shining lights of the election are over, the folks need toemember there are elections all over this country every year. And as you stated in your intro, there are voter id laws on the books right now. So we have to stand up to continue to be a champion for voters all over the country, including the state of ohio, and I certainly plan to lead the charge along with my other colleagues and the new general assembly. To create a level playing field for all voters. 
>> You know, we had talked back in october and leading up to the election that this would motivate the election base. That now turns to getting registered. Is there going to be an off-year effort like 2013? Should the democrats go down the road of making sure voter registration is taking place, and not in the 11th hour? 
>> Yes, there is an african proverb that says one shouldn't build a shield on the battlefield. Well, it is shield-building me. We plan to do that in ohio, we understand when it is elections, the party affiliation should be put on the side of the road. One thing we should only worry about, that is the power of the rt. 

[00:59:37]


>> You have done a great job for your state, we don't have a top five or ten of favorite guests on "the ed show," but I can guarantee you tonight, I would put you in the top five.Show." "The rachel maddow show" starts right now. Have a happy and blessed new year.

I'm eric bolli with kimberly guilfoyle, juan williams, andrea tantaros, gregoire. The countdown is on. This is "the five." ???????????? ???????????? 
>> Eric:2012 is coming to a close. Fired up and ready to go for 2013. It's been quite a year, guys. Go through "the five"'s biggest stories and worst stories but go around the table quickly. New year's eve. KIMBERLY, LOVE IT OR HATE IT? >> Kimberly: I love new year's eve. It usually work new year's eve. But you get off in midnight just in time for celebratory inebry yens. 
>> Eric: How you? 
>> Juan: I'm not crazy about it. I bet somebody else is having a better time. 
>> Eric: That is sad. 
>> Juan: Going at it. 
>> Kimberly: Glass h full. 
>> Juan: But I think I make you inuerto rico around new year's eve. Ran in geraldo at the restaurant and I thought it wasox in puerto rico. 
>> Eric: We met in a hot tub. 
[ Laughter ] I think that is juan williams. 
>> Andrea: Is that where the story ends? 
>> Eric: I'm walking across a pool, walking by, drink in my hand. Walk over and I think that's juan williams in the hot tub. Juan? Hey, bolling. Just what reese up, dude? 
>> Eric: I love new year's eve. It's my second favorite holiday. Fourth of july is my favorite, midto feel sum new year's eve is second. Happy time of the jeer. 
>> Andrea: I don't have any fun hot tub stories. 
>> Kimberly: That you went to share. 
>> Andrea: I actually like it. I used to not like it. Inused to think it was totally overrated. I still kind of do, but i don't know. The last couple of new year's have been fun. I'm in to it. Tonight will be a good night. 

[00:02:00]


>> Greg: You remind me of the year I met john gibson in the steep room. Hemmer was there. I think they drugged me. It woke up somewhere in new jersey without my pants. It's predictable. I don't likebe new year's eve. A stupid thing. Arbitrary thing. Why be reminded I'm one year closer to death. I don't need that. I prefer to sit home and watch reruns of "matlock" how you're supposed to spend it 
>>> medicated on over the counter cold medicines. 
>> Eric: We each picked our favorite, not our favorite story, because it's happy, but the big story of the year. Kimberly, kick it off. Your big story of the year. 
>> Kimberly: I thought it was the superstorm sandy. Specifically, when we had the little bear hug where christie, game changer for the election, where christie went and embraced obama. Was a big deal. He was the main people surrogate for romney campaigning in the electionfor him to validate and say hey, this guy is doing a great job. Didn't help days before the election. 
>> Eric: Big story. Sandy. Christie. Two big stories. 
>> Kimberly: Yes. 
>> Eric: Juan, what about you, sir? Actually I don't think there is any -- 
>> Juan: I don't think there is any question. The big story of the year was the election. The big story here is the change in the way technology, media treats an election. I remember the debate. The first debate. Won by romney. The way I was looking at it. Obama is not doing bad. Not doing great but basically you got to knock out the champ to beat him. It didn't see a knock-out. All my friends like sean hannity, I sit next two on twitter and they're scoring the debate minute by minute, everything going on in social media. In that case, romney was the winner. That's true with fundraising. Each campaign raised $1 billion. How much money is that? For what? 

[00:04:00]


>> Andrea: How could you think that obama was doing just okay job? J -- 
>> Juan: Ihought he was doing fine. 
>> Andrea: The only person in the world. I wish you for my math teacher in high school. 
>> Greg: Mitt lost. Like talking about the game won by the last place team. It doesn't matter. 
>> Eric: Not surprised this is the big story. 
>> Juan: How many hours did we spend talking about the election? 
c: HOURS. 
>> Juan: Thank you. 
>> Andrea: Give him a mulligan. Do another one. Eric, what about you? 
>> Eric: My favorite story, I don't why, but the red bull, the guy who jumped out little space -- there it is. Bombgartner, red bull jumped from space. I was glued to the tv when he did it. I think it's fantastic. Privately. Private money. He just did something that i would love to do some sometime. I couldn't stop watching that. Every sometime I see it, i love to see that. 
>> Juan: You want to do that? 
>> Eric: If I didn't have a 14-year-old son I'd do in a heartbeat. 
>> Andrea: How much did it cost him? 
>> Eric: I don't know. Whatever it cost red bull they make -- 
>> Andrea: He almost died, right? 
>> Eric: One of the reasons -- he blacked outch he would have broken more -- 
>> Greg: I black out all the time. Not from that. 
>> Eric: How can you jump out of is that cast? 
>> Greg: I don't need too that stuff. I'll tell you why. People like this are selfish. They go off and do the dare del activities. Who bails them out and who has to climb up the mountain? Poor gs that got to rescue the people. I keep more about the people that slip and fall in the streets than some guy jumping out of the plane. That is the truth. 
>> Andrea: You always slip and fall on the street after night in the bar. 
>> Juan: You could run in traffic if you need a thrill? 
>> Greg: Exactly! 
>> EriE IS THE ONLY GUY That jumped out of a little space capsule. 

[00:06:03]


>> Kimberly: Give it credit. Cool. Love it. Great story. 
>> Greg: Oh, c'mon. Jump up in a flame and then call me. 
>> Juan: Like michael jordan. What did you say? Arbitrary to -- I think this is like manufacturered. For what? I don't even like roller coasters. 
>> Eric: For a lot of reasons. Ed are bull did it. Freddie jump out and land in a hot tub with juan. 
>> Andrea: I would do that. Last weekend. 
>> Eric: Moving right along. 
>> Andrea: My story of the year is obamacare and the supreme court ruling. Not the story that dominated all year long but a big deal. The supreme court ruled that the mandate was upheld and people have to buy health insurance. One third of the economy. Even though might not be top of mind to everybody today, it will be top of mind for the rest of eternity and touch every single person in this country. It east a tax. You will be taxed forcibly. They held it up. Huge issue and huge court ruling. You are looking at me like that is your biggest -- 
>> Greg: No. That is a huge story. You added a new arm to government. That is a big deal for a lot of people. 
>> Eric: Surprising mike didn't make that his sub favorite story of the year. 
>> Juan: She is right. In terms of the american history, the social sy net and this was the missing element. Republican and democratic presidents tried to do it and failed to. It's an incredible accomplishment for any president. 
>> Eric: Are your siz that we find new taxes in the law? Medical device tax. Investment tax. 

[00:08:16]


>> Juan: Look, everybody agrees there are blank pages. We don't know what is to come. 
>> Andrea: Doesn't that scare you? 
>> Juan: What scares me, rather than get on board there are peep delight in congress shooting spitballs. 
>> Greg: Legitimate criticism is not a spitball. Na pelosi didn't bother to read it. That is not a spitball if you flow a large portion of the economy going to government that do nothing right. That is not a spitballle just why do republican governors say we're not going to do this. Let the fed do this. They said we don't like big government. They should control it. To me this is just like we don't likebe you guys. 
>> Andrea: They can opt out if they don't want opt out. To me, we have to throw spitballs. A lot of promises were made. Taxes wouldn't go up. Premiums wouldn't go up. Keep your doctor. All of those things not true. I think we will be talking about this story and this decision for years and decades come. Just I agree. 
>> Kimberly: This show next year at this time. 
>> Andrea: Count it. 
>> Juan: Get out of the hot tub before I shrivel. 
>> Greg: Hope and bo on "days of our lives" and on and off again. It spent a lot of time thinking about it. To me, the big story that changed the election was mitt dropping the ball in the third debate. It was about foreign policy and became something else entirely. An opportunity to nail president obama on benghazi and bring it home and win an election and he chose not to. He chose to play it safe. To me, that was the turning point. He got bad advice. Somebody said you know what? Don't do this. Or he had knowledge of what was going on, because he was given the knowledge by the white house so he felt compelled to keep it secret. The other thing, too, his son said mitt didn't want to be president. That is tragic to me. It might have meant that mitt would have been a good president. 

[00:10:28]


>> Juan: Do you think it's true? 
>> Greg: People who don't want to be president the end e good president -- tend to be good pdents. 
>> Andrea: Washington turned down power of king. 
>> Eric: I disagree. It's such a demanding job -- 
>> Greg: But to say, conservatives by nature do not like government. Natural inclination not to want to be in charge. 
>> Eric: Let me add something to the story. Mitt romney blowing it in the last debate, candy crowley. Second? Second. Misinformed, oh, yeah, president obama mentioned it. He wasn't prepared. 
>> He held back. 
>> Eric: The second debate. Third debate. 
>> Juan: It's too complicated. 
>> Eric: I don't -- actually I don't believe what tag said. Revisionism. I think romney wanted it badly. The ten debates with the republicans. They got huge ratings for fox. He went all the way through, remember his famous, I bet you $10 million -- $10,000. Great moments. 47% and the like. He wanted it. 
>> Andrea: The biggest story it was nonstory. The story that wasn't. The way the economy was. We never heard that story. Just romney, the taxes. The biggest story of the year was journalists didn't cover the story. 
>> Greg: Throw benghazi in that was well. 
>> Andrea: Nonstory. Programming note. Catch kimberly and greg tonight on fox news channel all american new year's eve broadcast at 11:00 p.M. 
>> Greg: We'll be in a hot tub. 
>> Kimberly: No, we won't. 
>> Eric: Waitingor ball to drop. What did you say? You lost your pants in a hot tub somewhere? Don't go away. Much more to come. Special including a look at some of the wild moments of the past year on "the five." Don't miss it. ???????????? ???????????? ???????????? ???????????? 

[00:16:22]


>> Kimberly: Hello. Welcome back to "the five" new year's eve special. To stuff we covered this year that we hope will go away in 2013. Okay, I'm going to begin right here. If around the te. Story I don't want to hear again or phrase is "fair share." This was a key component to the 2019 election. The president did the phrase repeatedly. Much to his success, ultimately. In the outcome of the election. The first time we saw a major presidential candidate using class warfare to create divide amongst hardworking miles per hours to suggest people who pay majority of taxes are not contributing their fair share. 
>> Juan: Glad you let us know how you feel. 
>> Kimberly: That was the point. 
>> Eric: In 2016 you will hear it more. Fair share. 
>> Juan: Here is so I don't want to hear again. Take a look. Or take a listen. ???????????? ???????????? ?????? gangnam style ?????? ?????? gangnam style ?????? 
>> Juan: Now that is something I can do without in 2013. It has swept the world. It's now the most watched video ever. It's in every -- I can't go to a ballgame. I can't go to the supermarket. I can't go to the dentist. The hot tub! Check it out, greg. What is that from years past? The ghost of, the ghost of new year's past. Macarena? My gosh. ?????? Macarena ?????? ?????? macarena ?????? ?????? hey, macarena ?????? 
>> Kimberly: So, juan, was that music clip from your last vacation in puerto rico in the lobby? 
>> Juan: In my new year's eve fantasy world. 

[00:18:25]


>> Andrea: You worry when gangnam style is a wedding song. Macarena is classic, permeated weddings everywhere. Gangnam style will be here to stay. 
>> Greg: The guy psy is galluping toward obscurity. In five years he will be doing porn or professional wrestling. Seriously, I hate that guy. Ja five years? 
-- 
>> Andrea: Five years? 
>> Greg: Maybe three. I can do the macarena and i can dowelie. 
>> Kimberly: What about the cabbage patch? Running man? 
>> Greg: Bob knows those. 
>> Juan: What are you doing tonight? 
>> Andrea: Wouldn't you want to know? 
>> Kimberly: She is all dolled up. Actually she has glitter -- 
>> Juan: She has glitter on. 
>> Eric: You know how to dougie? 
>> Andrea: I'll teach you. 
>> Eric: Teach me how to dougie? I know how to dougie? 
>> Juan: Been to a black wedding? Electric flies. 
>> Kimberly: That is not just at black weddings. That is at white weddings. That is racial. 
>> Eric: Do you know bob beckel claims to have won a disco dancing contest. 
>> Andrea: On roller skates. 
>> Eric: What? 
>> Kimberly: He convinced me want to go rolling skating. He is a disco roller skating champ. Right? 
>> Andrea: He does have a picture, though. 
>> Juan: Wait. Is bob in shorts on the roller skate? 
>> Andrea: He is not in roller skates in the picture. But put it up on "fox and friends." In white skip tight pants. It's traumatic. 
>> Kimberly: I'm not wait -- not making it up. 
>> Andrea: I'm not sure he won an award. He does exaggerate. 
>> Kimberly: He said he won the lighting award for his house. 
>> Andrea: He stole the lights off his neighbor's house. 
>> Kimberly: So the neighbor would have less lights. He did this at 2:00 a.M. Nothing good happens after 2:00. 

[00:20:29]


>> Eric: The story I don't want to hear another one, newtown, connecticut, mass murders. America changed twice in 15 years. Once at 9/11, a with the mass murders in newtown, connecticut. Enough of this. The dialogue should open up about everything that goes on. What goes on in their minds. What causes them to do this. But do something smart. Get the schools safe and locked down. I hope we never have another one. My guess is we might. Probably will. Pray we don't. 
>> Andrea: Color the batman movie shooting. Disturbing. 
>> Kimberly: That is why i rent pay for view. I was a prosecutor in the d.A.'S office, I had to hand a shooting. Go to the scene. Halle berry movie. I went in, the guy -- anyway, was shot by the police. Nobody died except for bad guy. Movie theaters, post traumatic movie stress disorder or somethin 
>> Andrea: I wish I could lighten everybody's new year's eve up. But I hope I never hear from again is sandra fluke. Not a conversation lifter. We heard a lot from miss fluke. Even getting her to headline the dnc, I thought was unprecedented. Unemployment was almost in the double digits. Million of people on unemployment line and you have a georgetown law student headlining the dnc for free birth control. What a country. How far we have come. In most presidential elections, it would have been considered p.R. Disaster. But this was genius. The democratic base love it. 
>> Kimberly: Speaking engagement. Huge turn-out. Ten people. Those are your friends and family. Phone a friend. 
>> Andrea: She will get a job and pay for her birth control. 
>> Juan: A note, that american women were plus ten for obama. 

[00:22:30]

>>> I'm bret baier in washington. New year's day 2013. 
The big story here today: Real questions at this hour about whether the senate passed fiscal cliff legislation will make it out of the house in one piece. Moments ago, you are looking at video of house speaker john boehner and majority leader eric cantor walking in a republican conference meeting together. A show of solidarity, perhaps, after cantor came out against the bill that passed the senate this morning. Looking live outside the meeting now. Tonight on "special report," g.O.P. Lawmakers are suggesting they may amend that bill and send it back to the senate. We'll explain what that means when we have live reports on both sides of pennsylvania avenue. Potennial market reaction to the late moves. At the white house, president obama's plane but gassed up and ready to go back to hawaii. But with no vote and no communication with boehner, what now? "Special report" from washington with all the fiscal cliff latest starts at 6:00. Now back to "the fiv." ???????????? ???????????? ????????????

[00:47:43]


>> Greg: That song doesn't work anymore. 
>> Kimberly: Yes, it does. 
>> Greg: I hate new year's eve resolutions because they don't exist. If every predictable reporter or news reader never brought them up again you'd never hear of them. It's true. The average person doesn't consider them until a chucklehead with a cheery smile brings it up. With doris, ill open for wkab. What are you giving up this year? If she would respond with "lame reporting" with a chick to the shin or groin. Why do the media do this every year? Fearful of to do anything different. Resolutions are a symptom. Think of the trite gar banal that passes for commentary in the media. Shallow attempts at psychoanalysis discussing root causes of violence. What is worse is their infatuation with symbolic. You could say that is my resolution but then you have license to punch me in the face. 
>> Kimberly: By goodness. That is real evidence -- 
>> Andrea: Can I punch you in the face because you banned resolution three days ago? 
>> Greg: I did it. I banned red lutions so we would don't a segment on it. What do they do? They gave me the segment. 
>> Andrea: You deserve it. 
>> Kimberly: Well done. 
>> Greg: It's media generated junk. You don't sit around with your friends going hey, are you going to give up something? 
>> Juan: Never. You talk about the news, i don't get it. The highest rated part of the told I'm told is the weather. I don't care. I'm not farmer. I don't care. 
>> Greg: Travelling. 
>> Kimberly: I love weather. 
>> Eric: What do you have against resolutions? It's fun to just -- I'm going to be better at this next year. 

[00:49:46]


>> Gre I DON'T DO THEM. 
>> Andrea: Don't you think people make personal steps to improve themselves? That is a good thing even they give it up. My resolution ten years ago was to stop biting my nails. 
>> Greg: Did it work? 
>> Andrea: Yeah. It did. Only time I made up with and stuck with it. 
>> Greg: Why did you pate for the end of the jeer? 
>> Andrea: I was forced to pick something and it worked out. 
>> Greg: I do my resolutions every day. I reto stop spying on you. 
>> Kimberly: Could you stick with that? It's getting to be awkward for the community policing group around my neighborhood. 
>> Greg: I'm just doing home security. 
>> Juan: The number one resolution of all time is -- 
>> Eric: Quit smoking. 
>> Juan: Lose weight. 
>> Greg: Probably lose weight. 
>> Andrea: Probably quit smoking, too. 
>> Kimberly: She doesn't smoke. 
>> Juan: She said that. 
>> Kimberly: You misunderstood this. 
>> Andrea: Watch what you say. 
>> Kimberly: The chewing tobacco. 
>> Kimberly: Bubble gum. 
>> Greg: Last friday? Couple days ago? You must be really hammered right now. You think that happened yesterday. The problem with resolutions and losing weight, you gain the weight back. You go on a crash diet for a month and give up, opposed to creating a normal eating plan. 
>> Eric: Or doing nothing. 
>> Greg: You are brainwashed to think it must be done. 
>> Eric: Media doesn't have anything to do with it. 
>> Greg: They are doing the stupid stories. 
>> Eric: You did your monologue. 
>> Greg: I'm trying to stop it. 
>> Andrea: Doing it now. 
>> Greg: I'm trying to kill it. 
>> Eric: You are the media. 
>> Greg: Why did I think i could change your mind. 

[00:51:46]


>> Juan: I am not going on a diet. The people who sit next to me in the plane and hot tub, especially those diving in the hot tub, they need to lose weight. The seats aren't big enough for these people. 
>> Greg: These people? 
>> Juan: But not me. I'm telling you. Campaign took weight off. 
>> Kimberly: Don't take up more thanour fair share in the hot tub. Moving on. 
>> Eric: One more thing is UP NEXT. Excuse me, sir I'm gonna have to ask you to power down your little word game. I think your friends will understand. Oh no, it's actually my GEICO app...see? ...I just uh paid my bill. Did you really? From the plane? Yeah, I can manage my policy, get roadside assistance, pretty much access GEICO 24/7. Sounds a little too good to be true sir. I'll believe that when pigs fly. OK, did she seriously just say that? GEICO. Just click away with our free mobile app. ???????????? ???????????? 

[00:55:34]


>> Eric: Time for one more thing. New year's eve edition. Go around the table. 
>> Greg: We have a special "red eye" tonight afterew year's eve. My one more thing is people i will miss. Of course andrew breitbart. Dear friend of mine. Forget politics, one of my closest friends. The world is less interesting and is grayer without him. If he were a leftist they'd name bridges after him. That's it. 
>> Eric: Great guy. Great guy. Miss him. 
>> Andrea: I know it's early, because we're not at midnight yet but I want to toast viewers of "the five" who joined usor wonderful year and loyal to us to help grow the audience. My hope is in 2013, everyone raise your glass, not just for health and happiness for you but hope you will join us for the next year to share more memories and more fun with the seven of us. 
>> Eric: Hear! Hear! 
>> Kimberly: You have to drink it. 
>> Eric: Sparkling -- 
>> Greg: Sparkling whatever. 
>> Kimberly: I drank it. This end of the table knows how to party. Just we can do it. 
>> Eric: My one more thing, this isostly my wife. Adrian and I were awarded the 2012 humanitarian of the year award from the new jersey animal coalition. We have a little tape. There is the website. They save sheltered dogs due to be put down. So adrian did fantastic work with them. Just wanted to point it out. 
>> Kimberly: Congratulations. 
>> Juan: Why don't you tell us -- 
>> Eric: Good boys. Just you help feed -- just you help feeding the -- 
>> Juan: You help feed them. 
>> Eric:10,000 worth of food. 
>> Greg: Feed animals to people. 
>> Eric: No. Saving the animals. Juan, you're up. 
>> Juan: You know what 2012 may be remembered for that we've got a stash of great athletic talent on the scene. Think about it. Andrew luck in indianapolis. Great quarterback. Robert griffin iii in washington. My redskins, go skins. Again, newtown. And what about on the baseball field? You've got mike trout of the los angeles anaheim angels. Phenomenal player. 

[00:57:54]


>> Andrea: Me, too. I mean. Just come back to washington -- 
>> Juan: Come back to washington. Bryce harper. Rookie of the year and tall sent on prime time for years to come. 
>> Eric: Good sports teams. 
>> Kimberly: More of "sportscenter" when we return after the break. Where am i? I love sports. It's been a great year. 
>> Andrea: You watch sports on mute, kimberly, for the guys. 
>> Kimberly: I like to make sure they are doing okay. I like the outif its. Okay. So now, that is a true story. So now on a serious note, think about the holidays and the people celebrating, drinking and drive is no-no. Madd does incredible work. Mothers against drunk driving or alcohol prevention and to sa lives. Statistics. In 2011, 9,878 people died in alcohol involved traffic crashes in the u.S. 27 per day. Let's take a number down in 2013. Right? Get a friend. 
>> Andrea: Someone doesn't have a charge and willing to stay sober, charge your friends $10. And pick them up and drop them off. Make cash. 
>> Kimberly: Key master. 
>> Juan: High five from "the five" on that. Too many people take it lightly. 
>> Eric: We have to leave it there. Going to greg but he went already. Leave it there. Thank you for joining us tonight and throughout the year. We have the greatest fans on the planet. Thank you. We also wish a happy new year to bob and dana. Cheers to you guys. Here is to making my prediction the reality. "The five" number one in 2013. Let's do it everybody.

At capitol hill. The dome light is on because congress isn session. And on the house floor they are now debating the senate passed ad legislation that passed 88--- 89-8 early this morning that deals with the effort to stop the fiscal cliff implications. The increasing of taxes and the sequester, the across-the-board tax cuts that would affect both the pentagon and domestic programs. Joining me now with an update, a re-set, if you will, chief congressional correspondent mike emanuel. Mike? 
>> Bret, good evening, once again. It has been an interesting day up here on capitol hill after that wide bipartisan vote in the united states senate we instantly heard grumblings this morning from house republicans who said they wanted to take time to read the bill. After they read the bill they did not like what they saw. They said where are the spending cuts. Raise taxes $41 for are every dollar or so that we are going to save money. That didn't add up for them and so house republican leadership spent a whole lot of time today, two different meetings behind closed doors with the rank and file allowing the rank and file to vent about the deal and talk about a way toward. They talked about the possibility of doing an amendment eceptionly to try -- essentially to try to tack on spending cuts on to the existing bill and then send it back to the united states senate. Senate democrats threatened to eceptionly leave that sitting on the desk to not touch it and then ultimately to blame the house republicans for punting on a deal that got a huge bipartisan vote in the senate and blaming them for the hugest tax hike in american history. A lot of republican leaders behind closed doors essentially said we don't think this is a very good deal, we don't think we had a very good bargaining position to start but bottom line is the country has officially gone off the fiscal cliff and republicans in the house don't want to be blamed for it. So they are going to live to fight another day obviously on the debt ceiling deal when that comes up in the coming weeks, bret. 

[00:02:08]


>> Bret: Okay, mike. Let's listen back in to house minority leader pelosi. She just finished saying putting pressure on republicans she doesn't want her side carrying most of the water on this and if they do, they can crow about it. Let's listen to the last part of her speech. 
>> That again, while this bill doesn't accomplish all that we need to do to grow the economy, reduce the deficit and strengthen the middle class it is a good way for us to have a happy start to a new year by taking this first step. I hope that as again you balance the equities, the pros and cons of this legislation that you weigh heavily in favor of the message that it sends to the kitchen tables of america about the respect we have for them meeting their needsers meeting their challenges, honoring their aspirations. This great middle class is the backbone of our democracy. Let us all be very patriotic tonight, support our middle class, support our democracy, vote aye on this strong bipartisan legislation which passed 89-8 in the united states senate. Let's step up to the plate to do that in the house of representatives. I urge my colleagues to vote aye and yield back the balance of my time. 
>> Gentleman from michigan. Mr. Camp. 
>> Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 45 seconds. 
>> The gentleman is recognize. 
>> This is the first step. And now that we have permanently settled how much revenue the government is going to take out of the economy we can move on to next steps. We can and will pursue comprehensive tax reform this year in 2013. And next steps we need to address the fundamental drivers of our deficits and debt and that is out of control spending. And with that I urge support for this bill and I reserve the balance of my time. 
>> The gentleman's time is reserved. 
>> I yield myself 15 seconds. 
>> The gentleman s recognized. 
>> I just don't want the chairman's statement that this settles permanently how much revenue will be made available. The president has made clear there has to be a balanced approach and no one should be misled into thinking otherwise. No one. I now yield two minutes to the distinguished gentleman from new york mr. Rangel. 

[00:04:38]


>> That was sandy levin the top democrat there on the house ways and means committee make the point after dave camp the chairman of the house ways and means committee said that they wanted to have a balanced approach. Something the president mentioned the other day at a news conference as you look at rangel taking his turn on the house floor. To hear sandy levin, congressman levin, ed, talk about this s not the end of potential revenue essentially saying this isn't the end of tax increases andhe effort to go after high income earners for more taxes was something that the president seemed to be signaling the other day that campaign style event at the eisenhower executive office building. 
>> You're right, bret. The president said it at that event here at the white house basically said more taxes will be going up in the days ahead in order to pay down the debt. And let's not forget there are other taxes going up today january 1 even as we talk about the bush tax cuts that are being extended permanently. Number one in order to pay for healthcare reform some people are seeing their dividends tax on dividends go up starting today just over 3 percentage point increase. Payroll tax cut that had been on the books for the last couple of years expired yesterday. That is not part of this deal. Many of the viewers will see that I payroll taxes go up starting today. So in the pay checks moving forward those are going go up. The other thing that is important to look at is when congressman sandy levin was saying this is all part of the president's balanced approach which the president has talked about again and again over the last year or so, that means tax increases, the president was direct and on oest with the american people about that we note. But he also talked about spending cuts. And in this case, this deal is $620 billion in tax increases and yet about a net of about $15 billion in spending cuts. That is obviously not balanced. Now, the white house view is the president was willing to have balance and had $1.2 trillion in spending cuts on the table as well as #s $1.2 TRILLION IN TAX INCREASES On the table. Speaker boehner walked away from the deal and went to plan b which did not have spending cuts, only the tax increase for millionaires which could not pass. And so they are blaming speaker boehner for walking away from the table. But the bottom line is this president is going to face a lot of pressure in the the days ahead during that debt ceiling de elsewhere to finally come up with entitlement reform that makes spending cuts in addition to the taxes starting to go up. 

[00:07:21]


>> Bret: Ed, we heard the president talk numerous times about how he does not want a battle with republicans over increasing the debt ceiling and how we heard he s not going to play that game. He used that friday. We are not going to do it that way. How is he not going to do it that way? How will they prevent that from happening? 
>> It is an interesting behind the scenes strategy starting to take place. I was talking to one of the president's top advisors a week or so ago and he basically said theyville a completely different approach in the debt ceiling debate than we have seen in this battle and he said basically the president would not be having meetings with congressional leaders here over raising the debt ceiling and not on the phone with speaker boehner and senator mcconnell over that. I said you are not going to talk to him and a second advisor interrupted and said have you called someone and gotten their voice mail? I said what are you talking about? 
>> Lookion the debt ceiling is som president believes should be negotiated. They he believe if the president sits down and negotiates it he will lose that battle and inside the white house their view that what republicans did is hold the economy hostage. You heard the talking points before and they said they are not going to go through that again. The republican view on this is that the threat of not lifting the debt ceiling is what forced the president a year and a half summer of 2011 to come up with spending cuts. In this debate we are seeing there is virtually no spending cuts. The bottom line is the republicans will push ahead and say he they will hold that over the president's head to get more spending cuts. The white house saying we are not going to sit down and negotiate it. I talked to one of the president's advisors tonight and he told me if you think this battlele was tough he said it was a direct tough then we are about to ensure teresa payton 60 days of nasty -- but to enter 60 days of nastiness. A prelude to a much bigger battle over spending cuts, bret. 

[00:09:29]


>> Bret:60 days of nastiness. I don't know what the days we just passed could be called -- 
>> this is day one. 
>> Bret: Could be nastier, perhaps. One last thing, what is the perception inside the white house of the bigger problem when it comes to spending entitlement problems? We have heard the president talk numerous times in the past about the drivers of medicare, medicaid, social security and how eventually they will overtake the u.S. Economy. He said that at numerous events and he talked about concern about getting things under control in a big picture way. It was his deficit and debt commission that he commissioned that came up with a solution in the simpson bowles that hasn't really moved forward. How do they say they going to deal with that? Or do they in the wake of what republicans have been talking about? 
>> Last night I do one of the president's top advisors and he basically said that their view now is that they may have a shift in strategy and instead of focusing on a so-called grand bargain and everyone is tired of hearing about that phrase again and again over the last year and a half. A big deal with a lot of spending cut thes and a lot of tax increases frank little. They are starting to see there is so much division over that kind of approach it might be better to move forward with smaller chunks of deficit reduction and smaller deals like this that sort of chip away at the problem. The problem with that strategy as you know is the explosive growth of the entitlements like medicare is so severe that if you chip away in little bits you may never really turn the problem around. Again, the white house accuses speaker boehner are walking away from the table. The president was willing to reform the entitlements in recent months. The republicans believe he wasn't serious about cutting entitlements but the white house basically says they should have called the president's bluff and signed the grand bargain the president had on the table a few weeks guy and we could workers have seen. He has now been reelected and has four more years in office and he will face pressure to o show presidential leadership in solving what is one of the nation's biggest problems this exploding debt. 

[00:11:44]


>> Bret: Ed henry great job at the white house as always. We will head back for any breaking details. Back with our panel. Charles, just react to what you just heard. 
>> I was really fascinated by the exchange that went on on the floor of the house between dave camp who is a republican chairman of the house ways and means committee and sandy levin the democrat who is the ranking democrat on the committee. One of the grand old old timers in the house and camp who is trying to get this thing through with the best face on it said you know, well, this marks the end of the tax raising phase of all this, this puts a cap on it and levin responded in 15 seconds in one of the sharpest remarks I ever heard from a member of the house who looks as if he is about to fall asleep said very quietly said no, this is not the end, this is not the cap. This is the beginning of taxation which echos exactly what the president had said on monday. And that one of the great objectives of democrats here is to solve our fiscal problems overall by returning us to high tax rates and that is where they want to go pre-regan. Another interesting exchange earlier at end of the hour between two leading republicans between darrell issa and david camp and issa is in support i mean issa is against and camp is in favor. Obamhas succeeded in splitting the republicans. Weakening them and now this has to pass the house with democratic support which shows that republicans have lost control of the house which was otherwise a blocking agent. Obama has had a political success on top of a substantive success. 
>> Bret: Sandy levin, congressman from michigan continuing to call democrats up for this debate on the senate piece of legislation. We'll go through exactly what is inside that on the the other side of the break as we continue with our panel and continue coverage of this historic night. A vote in the house of representatives to try to avoid all of the things that come along with the fiscal cliff that the u.S. Has already gone over.

[ Male Announcer ] ROBITUSSIN???? LIQUID FORMULA Soothes your throat on contact and the active ingredient relieves your cough. Robitussin????. Don't suffer the coughequences??????. >>t: THIS IS A FOX NEWS Alert. I'm bret baier live in washington. Watching the house floor where the house is in the process of debating the senate h-passed legislation on the fiscal cliff. Here is what is in the legislation as you take a look at the different bullet points. First of all, it is a tax -- makes the bush tax cuts permanent. Extending for all incomes up to $400,000 for individual and $450,000 for a family. Effectively that means households above those thresholds their tax rate would go up to 39.6% up from 35%. And that was -- that is the current tax rate. The 39.6% is the rate that was back in the clinton area. It also has the payroll tax cut expiring. It does have payroll tax cut increase actually up to 6.2%. The bill would permanently adjust the income exemption levelsor the alternative minimum tax, the amt and would adjust it for inflation. That is a big deal because every year congress would have to come back and do what is called an amt patch. They won't have to do that now. Also, capital gains. Capital gains and dividend tax rates for high income households would increase to 20% from 15%. For everyone else investment tax rates would remain at 15% or below. Then you have extending long-term unemployment benefits through 2013. The estate tax would be 40% of inheritance and $10 million per couple you, $5 million individual. It extends business tax credits and stammels tax credits, including wind farm credits. The business tax credits are the tax extenders and also does the medicare doc fix and that s avoiding a scheduled 27% cut mckinley reimbursement for medicare services for are one year. That would also boost the deficit. Also a place for the sequester, the across-the-board cuts that would hit the pentagon and domestic programs but only replaces that for two months and that was one of the biggest fight on the senate side before the senate passed this piece of legislation. Right now you are listening to jim rand, democrat from maryland. Let's listen in. 

[00:18:30]


>> We will have none of those resources to make that investment after we make this vote tonight. And the problem is we set up three more fiscal clif. We are going to have to deal with the debt ceiling. We are going to have to deal with the continuing resolution. Expiration. And we will have to deal with the sequester. And all that is left is spending cuts so the only question we have to ask ourselves is what programs do we cut and how deep do we cut them? We got to look back on this night and regret it not withstanding the fact that 95% of it apparently will vote for it. Thank you, mr. Chairman. 
>> I'm prepared to close. 
>> The gentleman from michigan, mr. Levin. 
>> I now yield one minute to the gentleman from new york. 
>> Bret: I said jim moran from maryland. From virginia. Heated up about the fiscal cliff debates yet to come. And he is right. One will start just after this one if in fact this bill passes because the debt ceiling debate will begin soon after that as we talked about tonight with the panel. We will continue this it looks like they are coming to the end of the debate and the vote will happen soon after that.

[00:23:08]


>> Bret: This is a fox news alert. Congress getting ready to act. The house of representatives in action debating the senate-passed legislation. Now, you are listening, seeing, rather, jim clyburn, congressman from south carolina. The democrats finishing up their debate on this bill, a bill that does a number of things. We just outlined. There are critics on both sides of the aisle but supporters say this s another step forward. Let's toss it now to chris stirewalt fox visual politics editor for his take on what we are seeing here. Chris, you know, republicans seem today to have to come to grips with this. And it seems just counting heads according to our producer mike emanuel up on the hill that they willle have the votes to pass this. Your thoughts on this piece of legislation and where we are? 
>> Well, if they are going to pass it, bret, they will have to do it with a whole lot of democrats because as I am looking here tonight and talking to republicans in the house caucus they are not happy about this. They don't like this. This is a to them they have been jammed. And they don't like it. And they have been left over to the last minute. And they knew this when the president rejected the idea -- if we think about it this way, the president rejected $800 billion in new tax revenue from tax loophole closures and said that it had to be a rate increase and here we stand with $650 billion in tax rate increases. It is less money and the republicans feel embittered by this. The speaker may be able to let this go forward and we are hearing the democrats now. We are hearing charlie rangel go forward with this. What I'm hearing in my in box is that e conservatives in the house republican caucus are not happy about how this has shaped up. 

[00:25:13]


>> Bret: So they live to fight another day, is that the pitch that was made behind closed doors? They fight this battle using the debt ceiling as the leverage and they try to go for the spending cuts in the big changes over the next six weeks? John boehner is a different kind of speaker of the house than we he have ever seen before in this sense. Whatever they want to do they will do. His members are allowed to vote, however, they are going vote. Now, the hastert rule and we heard a lot about the hastert rule and I don't want to get down into the weeds here. 
>> Bret: We he talked about it the majority of the majority that the speaker wouldn't bring forward a piece of legislation if the majority of his own caucus didn't have the votes for it. If he had to pass something using more democrats than republicans he wouldn't bring forward the bill. 
>> You are kind to let me go weed whacking but the truth is boehner is a different kind of speaker than we experienced in the past in that whatever the rule is about who gets to vote which way or what comes on the floor boehner is a different kind of speaker and he doesn't whip. He doesn't force people to vote one way or the other. He says you will vote, however, you want to do. This is a guy that we saw have a stand ovation inside his own caucus the day before yesterday and the way he does it and the way that everything that he does is this, you do what you want to do. And if this is going to pass, i suspect if it is not a majority of democratic votes it will be a strong plurality of democratic votes and there is a lot of unhappiness because there are zero cuts in this. And this is what the republicans wanted. And as far as what happens the next time and what happens the next year, there is -- this is a strong word but heart brokenness over the lack of cuts in this and when you talk to these folks and when they are e-mailing out you can hear it in their voice that even those who are going to vote for it are embittered over this. This does not set up a good opportunity for governance for the president and the speaker. 

[00:27:19]


>> Bret: Chris, stand by if you will. That is the house minority whip steny hoyer who have from maryland on the house floor now. Take a list green bay we come listen. 
>> Almost everyone who has spoken says this bill is not perfect. That observation could be applied to any and owl bills that we consider in this house. Compromise is not the art of perfection. By its very definition a compromise contains elements that neither side likes. But it also contains pieces both sides can embrace. What we will do tonight is not adopt a piece of legislation that will give literally tens of millions of americans the assurance that their taxes will not be raised, millions of small businesses that their taxes will not be raised, millions of people who through no fault of their own are struggling to find a job and try to keep bread on their table, the assurance that we will be there to help. Tonight we will come together and do something else. With 37.5 hours left to go in the 112th congress, we will display to all of our constituents that yes in the final analysis we have the ability to come together, to act not as republicans, not as democrats, but as americans. 435 of us sent here by our neighbors and friends to try to do the best we can, realizing there are 435 points of view that sit in this chamber. And that what we strive to do is to reconcile those differences to create consensus for without consensus democracy cannot work. There will be time for partisan differences. There will be time for partisan confrontation in the days in the 113th congress. But this night as we end the 112th congress, as we have strived mightily to come to an agreement with great difficulty and realizing that all of us have very strong feelings i severely regret that this is not a big, bold, balanced plan. 

[00:29:57]


>> I yield two minutes to the gentleman. 
>> The gentleman recognized for an additional two minutes. 
>> I recognize this is not a big, bold and balanced plan. We had an opportunity to reach such an agreement. N. A bipartisan fashion. And we will not reach a big bold and balanced plan without bipartisanship because the decisions we will have to make will be too difficult. Not to be done in a bipartisan fashion. But this night we take a step. A positive step. And the people watching us, mr. Speaker, on television tonight and reading about their congress tomorrow and seeing that we were able to act. Not perfectly. But in a bipartisan fashion to try to take a step towards fiscal responsibility, fiscal stability, and, yes, caring for those who most need our help in this country. And so I urge my colleagues as the leader of my party in this con restructuringed us to survivo urged us to support this legislation as an american who understands that our people believe that action is necessary. And I would urge all of us as we close this debate to do so in a way that brings us together not drive us apart. 
>> Bret: House minority whip steny hoyer urging the passage of the bill. The debate time is almost up. Republican ares not offering any more speakers and democrats still have a few more. We will be covering this until THE BIG VOTE.d Keep it right here on fox news CHANNEL.So why treat it like it's a little cold? There's something that works differently than over-the-counter remedies.

[00:34:01]


>> Bret: This is is a fox news alert live in washington continuing coverage of the house vote on the senate-passed legislation to avoid the fiscal cliff. Just as I said no more republicans were taking to the floor as the chairman of the house ways and means committee dave camp had said. Ed royce republican from california has taken to say a few words. Let's listen in. 
>> It permanently protects the middle class from the alternative minimum tax and it adjusts that for inflation. The plan does away with a new entitlement program created in obama care and makes permanent a 15% capital gains in dividends rate for income up to $400,000 for singles, and $450,000 for married couples and a 20% rate for those above. That rate would have gone to 39.6% for dividends. That would have been very injurious for our capital markets. That would be very injurious for economic growth if we allowed that to happen. So tax relief has been achieved. Now, is the time for the president to work with congress to address government overspending, the underlying problem and I yield back the balance of my time. 
>> Gentleman yields back his time. Gentleman from michigan, mr. Levin? 
>> Ready to close? 
>> Bret: Bring in chris stirewalt. Obviously the republicans supporting this piece of legislation are listing all of benefits of this -- of these tax cuts and congressman royce mentioning the permanent fix for the alternative minimum tax. 
>> If they were going do this, brett bret, they should have done it a lot sooner. Just from a strategic point of view regardless of the policy, if you were going to extend the bush tax rates for any level and we saw how they failed with 1 million and below, now we are talking about 450 and below. If you are going to do this, they strategically should have done it sooner because with no cuts, zero cuts and that is what is in thjs legislation is ro cuts, they should have done it sooner. This is wasteful toave gone this long and get this close to the end an hour and a half away from the end and get zero cuts is wasteful. Tom cole the congressman from oklahoma who used to run the republican's political arm in the house basically said and he said it probably too soon in order to get buy-in from the members of the house republican caucus but if you going to do it, do it sooner, don't wait until the end and then you can fight over getting some cuts this way in the end they are going to it looks like they going to extend the tax rates and not get any cuts out of the deal. 

[00:36:48]


>> Bret: Okay, chris. Stand by, if you would. Sandy levin from michigan the top democrat on the house ways and means committee saying he is about done offering democrats up in the debate which means that the debate is closing and we could have the final series of votes which is what we have been waiting for. As we wait for that I want to bring back jonathan hoenig from capitalistpig .Com about the market reaction. We have been talking about what the markets may do and whistle what they have done up until now about washington's back and firth. Your additional thoughts? We didn't talk that long about an hour guy. 
>> Bret, I do think you will likely see some sem brans breaking news of a relief rally. Literally trillions of dollars on the sidelines waiting to see what would play out here literally in the last the few hours. No question as was just pointed out because no spending cuts are proposed there is zero spending cuts within the whole proposal perhaps some tax cuts have been preserved but no spending cuts and that along with the entitlement problem really is what is at the heart of our nation's financial troubles. Those aren't addressed at all and sandy levin talked about even higher taxes down the pipeline. With all of the talk about needing more resolution and certainty, I think unfortunately for america's investors very much the opposite has been achieved tonight. 
>> Bret: The business community and how washington has operated against the deadlines and these cliffs and we will see more of them. We have the debt ceiling coming up. We have the continuing resolution to fund the government. We have a few more of these already in the pipeline not even knowing what is still out there. How does wall street look at that long-term and what do analysts say about that? 
>> I -- in my experience, bret, they are resentful. The government talks about an extra 3, 4, 5% at capital gains taxes are going up. That seems to mean nothing to washington but means a lot to wall street. In terms of planning long-term the fact that there had been no long-term certainty put into place here. There has been no cuts to it entitlement programs addressed at all. Once again wall street both the big players and very small left unable to plan long-term. Think three, five, ten years out about their own finances and that of their companies because there has been no substantial resolution to any of the core issues, the spending and entitlements which have not been addressed by this president or this at all. 

[00:39:27]


>> Bret: We are watch, the final debate. Dave camp is wrapping up now. Take a listen in as he closes his remarks. 
>> And that is out of control spending. Obligations that we have not got the financial wherewithal to meet. We need to strengthen those programs and make sure that they are sustainable for the long-term but also need to it address the problem that is out of control spending. This is the first step. Per are manent tax policy that sets the stage for comprehensive and fundamental tax reform and then addressing out of control spending. This will be several steps. This is an important one and critical one for the future of the country it and I urge a yes vote and yield back the balance of my time. 
>> The previous question isrd odd. Jet is on the motion by the gentleman from michigan mr. Camp. Those in favor say aye. Oh supposed? 
>> The recorded vote is qud. Those favoring a recorded vote will rise. The recorded vote is ordered. Members record their votes by electronic device. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule 20 this 15 minute vote on the motion to concur will be followed by a vote on the motion to suspend the rules and pass if ordered. This is a 15 minute vote. 
>> Bret: And here we go. This is the vote tally. The vote that we have been waiting for. After finishing debate this is now a 15 minute vote on the fiscal cliff legislation that passed the senate overwhelmingly. We will see how the vote comes down as it is tallied. You can see on the bottom of the screen there. This is again not controlled by us, the camera or the tally but the time remaining 14:34 and YOU CAN SEE THE YEAs AND Nays. Back with the panel. Steve, thoughts? 

[00:41:29]


>> Well, it was interesting to see that republicans you just had a couple of republicans up there making the case for this and making arguments on behalf of this vote. I think if I'm a republican if I'm advising the republicans thats as much good as I'm going to say about this bill from now now forward. I'm not talking about it or selling it as a positive. I think it is going be the case that people in the country who haven't I don't think been as engaged on the question of the fiscal cliff as they had in the debates over health care and things of that nature are going to -- the more they see of this the more they don't like the process. The less they going to like it. You will have people who probably haven't been paying close attention wake up and discover that their payroll taxes have gone up and they are not going to like this deal. Film' the republicans I don't continue to try to sell this as positive preservation of the bush tax rates. Move on quickly and try to refocus as we heard dave camp doing the discussion on spending. 
>> Bret: As we look at the numbers, the magic number in the house has been 218 but chad points out that at 418 votes members cast ballots on the last the role call vote tonight. That means that they he don't need the typical 218 to pass and you have to get of gage where it is. Might be 217 at a minimum. Out of 418 they might need as low as 210 to reach the threshold. It is likely that tonight they are are going to get well over that. 
>> Right. I think it is important to point out because we have continued noting the majority rule that the republican speaker to be up for another reelection vote for his job would be bringing bills to the floor only that could attract the majority but the truth is that dennis hastert the speaker who people use his name for this rule actually waved it several times himself and this might be an occasion where we are going to see some democrats drop off but be the majority of the vote, not republicans. But looking forward after this sort of dismal night for republicans, as steve has said, you know, and charles, the focus is now going to turn to spending. And republicans have to continue to beat that drum with the onus back on the president and the democrats. I don't think actually that the president gets away with saying that the debt ceiling debate is nonnegotiatable. That the debt ceiling increase is nonnegotiable. What you will flare business and market watchers and the markets themselves in the weeks to come is we have a major debt problem and someone has to get around to dealing with it. 

[00:44:29]


>> Bret: We heard it from simpson bowles and the deficit and debt commissions. 
>> And they will keep talking and that is a problem. The president is still complicit in this. If our government gets our credit rating downgraded again our government has asked for it. He is the president of the united states. We are in a fragile economy. The world is waiting to see if we are still a good bet. And that is the bottom line. We can get past this vote and on to the next but at some point the president has to engage on whether -- yes, the big question for business was do we go off the cliff. The next big question for businesses before they release a trillion dollars in capital or $2 trillion they have been sitting on the sidelines with, do we have the sent to continue to invest in this -- certainty to continue to invest in this economy and new hires that is the question that the president ultimately has to answer at some point. 
>> Bret: The yeas, 103 and nays 56. A little more are than ten minutes left in the vote on the motion to pass the senate legislation to deal with the fiscal cliff. Charles krauthammer? 
>> The markets will make the president look at the debt problem. But look how much he gained tonight. They gave away so little. They gave away nothing. For example he eject the very idea of having just a technical change in how the cost of living is calculated. Why did he do that? So that he now can give a bone to the republicans in the future in another negotiations. Again, in return for spending cuts. Look, tonight is one of the low points that republicans have ever had in the last few years. It was on substance and also on politics. On the substance this is a really bad deal and obama's cleverness in insisting on raising rates s that he is going to follow this now by trying to raise taxes through deductions. And remember, the republican speaker has already offered $800 billion in higher -- in higher revenues as a result of eliminating loopholes. He still has that he can pocket. So he gets a double rise in taxes on rates, and then on eliminating the deductions and that is on substance. But on the politics I think was really fascinating what we saw tonight which is obama understood that if he got the republicans he insisted on rates being increased. He made it an ultimatum. Said either you agree on raising rates on the rich or get nothing to go over the cliff. He broke the unity of the republicans. In the last two years he wasn't able to achieve anything of substance in the house because it was a united republican house that stopped him. All the achiefments he got, obama care and stimulus he got in the first two year when had control of the congress. Now, look what happened tonight. The republicans are split and this will only be able to pass because democrats are supporting it. On the politics of this, he s now very much weakened the republicans. He split the republicans in the house and the one obstacle to his being able to control the agenda in washington is now very much diminished and that i think was his political objective in all of this so he achieved a lot on substance, higher taxes or tried to undo the regan idea of the lower taxes and second on the politics by splitting the republicans and taking essentially control of washington. That doesn't mean he will succeed through the two years and have it all his way but he sure has succeeded tonight and that is republicans as chris said are so bitter and heartbroken. 

[00:48:12]


>> Bret: You are looking at the vote tally. Already have 43 republicans voting for this and you can see the democratic tally right now. I should point out that while the clock is open and you see 7:35 on the bottom of the clock that members can change their vote. They can go and change yea to nay and nay to yea. They have not vote. You can see all of the not vote there's. Also not official until the gavel comes down and worth pointing out that the votes do change. When we were talking about the magic number to pass it depends on how many members vote. It is usually 218 to pass a piece of legislation but judging by the other pieces, the other bills tonight it could be as low as 210, just to explain that further. Steve, do you buy what charles was saying about the president's motivation here politically? 
>> Yeah, I think he is right about the consequences of it. I do think he succeeded in dividing republicans and you also have a situation where republicans having given in on this principle, this long held principle of not raising rates now the president no doubt will ask again and again and again to say well, now I have -- i think we need more on rates. I think we need more on revenues. The speaker offered us this money on revenues. I don't think there is any question the president has said it and we heard sandy levin say it tonight that he is going to ask republicans to do more on the revenue side. What I think the republicans can say is we focused on the revenue and first step was all revenue and it has got to be spending. That is the source of the problem and everybody understands that. 
>> Bret: This vote is continuing. We will take a quick break. Keep it here for the latest asts the house votes on a big bill. ?????? ?????? that over time, having high cholesterol and any of these risk factors can put them at increased risk for plaque buildup inheir arteries.

>> Bret: This is a fox news alert. You are looking live at the house floor where the house is now voting on the fiscal cliff legislation. YOU CAN SEE THAT IS 166 YEAs To 110 nays. This is not official. This is kind of an unofficial scorecard. Not official until the gavel comes down but it is the tallying done by the house inside. And they are now republicans at 59 YEAs AND DEMOCRATS AT 110. It is very rare for the speaker of the house to vote but we have been told that speaker john boehner made his way to floor again and made that walk many times through will rogers, the hallway there in front of the house chamber and just after that he voted here and he did vote aye for the bill. We have not been told yet that -- we have been told that the house majority leader eric cantor has not voted yet. We d word of that and other names we don't have big republican names as of yet but you can see the tally continues as time is ticking down. Again the magic number we believe to be abo 210 to pass this piece of legislation. We are back with the panel. A.B., The boehner vote and well, the significance of what you are seeing there on the screen? 
>> Well, interesting that they have lost ten democrats so far. That number could grow. But if they could -- if the democrats contained it, that is pretty interesting and you heard some, you new york city you know, the leadership exhorting the members to support it. 
>> Bret: Almost twice as many democrats at this point. 
>> Right. I'm told that the boehner vote on the rule was a good sign from members who are going to vote for this and hold their nose. They were looking for leadership cover and boehner voting on the rule gave them the sense that that -- that he would -- that he would come and vote for the bill and they are hoping that that gives some other republicans cover because the people who are doing what they think is the dirty work to get this over the line in the conference obviously are looking for company. 

[00:55:38]


>> Bret: Saying that grover norquist just tweeted out a message. Of course, the legendary or depending on your point of view if you are a democrat infamous tax cutter and fights for tax cuts and against tax increases here in washington heads up a group that really keeps the fire on the feet of lawmakers here. He just tweeted out "the bush tax cuts lapsed at midnight last night. Every republican voting for senate bill is cutting taxes and keeping his or her pledge ." Something that I think republicans were mentioning already. You can see that the time remaining there is at zero. And we are at 2:05 to 139. You can see the no votes there ticking down. The time can be extended for this vote and apparently there are a number of lawmakers who are waiting until the very end to cast their votes. Again, we are are on the threshold here of passing the passage and I think we may have just made I 214. Charleston? 
>> While it is over. 
-- Charles? 
>> The good news for all americans is that as of tomorrow we may never have to hear the word, phrase "fiscal cliff" again. What I will regret is not being able to watch the charmingly languid sandy levin in the house. If you look at the democratic side it is about 10-1 in favor by democrats and almost to about 2 to 1 against by republicans which is a good reflection of who won here. And what s so interesting is that, of course, it is the democrats who are carrying the votes and if you look at the whole process it started out with the republicans in the house. The speaker as the one who was negotiating on behalf of the opposition. In the end he was completely sidelined. Once the republicans had split in the house they were not a factor. It was negotiated in the senate where the democrats, of course, have the majority. Mitch mcconnell to his credit was able to negotiate a deal, any deal that would avoid avoid what would have been another catastrophe, the republicans being the ones responsible for the country having to have the huge increase in taxes. He worked out a deal as he has done in the past with the debt ceiling and in 2010 when worked out another tax increase agreement with obama. He did his job. Notice how all the way ended up? In the senate and by the time it reached the house controlled by the republicans they were irrelevant and had no choice and the democrats put it over the top decisively as you can see on the board right now. That shows how much this has been a political disaster for the republicans. Theyville to regroup. And remember, when vow have a new house thursday there will be 10 more democrats. The republicans will be even weaker and they are going to go into the fight with obama over the next issues over the continuing the resolution et cetera a lot weakened than from they were at the beginning of the fight after election da 

[00:59:04]


>> Bret: The fiscal cliff legislation it appears has passed. We are waiting for the official tally. But they have well surpassed now the votes needed to pass this piece of legislation. It now goes on to the president to be signed into law. As the vote is tallied we are waiting for the gavel to come down. This ends a back and forth over the last two days new year's eve into new year's day that has been tense on capitol hill to say the least.

"The last word" holiday party where we will choose our person of the year and a whole lot more. 
>> Whoa, whoa, whoa, let's step back for a minute. 
>> Can we drop a little bit of bologna. 
>> Pick any other republican in the country. 
>> I think it's about envy. 
>> He is the worst republican in the country. 
>> I think it's about class warfare. 
>> You chose to start the debate with it. Don't try to blame somebody else. 
>> I'm the tortoise. I just take one step at a time. 
>> If you don't run, chris christie, romney will be the nominee. ????????? 
>> if men are from mars and women are from venous. 
>> Republicans are waging the war on women. 
>> Is mitt romney from jupiter. 
>> I believe the supreme court should overturn roev. Wade, yes. 
>> I love you, women. 
>> Back in my days they used bayer aspirin for contraception. 
>> The gals put it between your knees and it wasn't that costly. 
>> History will made at the supreme court. 
>> The individual mandate is constitutional. 
>> This is the decision. 
>> A fascinating week. 
>> I know the debate over this law has been witnessed. 
>> Democrats thought they were going to lose and republicans thought they were going to win. 
>> I think roberts found the answer. 
>> When we look back we will be better off. 
>> Governor romney's caught on tape moment. 
>> The shocking tape from romney. 
>> It's not elegantly stated. Let me put it that way. I'm speaking off the cuff. 
>> In his words, nearly half of the country will never take personal responsibility for their lives. 
>> It's not elegantly stated. Let me put it that way. I'm speak off the cuff. 
>> If I were a rich man, diby, diby, dibby dumb, dumb. 
>> People want to know who is going to win. Who is going to score the punches. 
>> Both presidential candidates battening down the hatches. 

[00:02:02]


>> I'm sorry, jim. I to be the subsidy to pbs. I like pbs. I love big bird. Bought us binders full of women. 
>> Governor, we also have fewer horses and I don't know i don't know nets. 
>> Big bird. 
>> Binders. 
>> I just called president obama to congratulate him. 
>> I congratulated him and paul ryan on a hard fought campaign. 
>> I prey that the president will ful in guiding our nation. 
>> We are an american family and we rise or fall together. The task of perfecting our union moves forward. 
>>> Tonight we are celebrating the year in the news, the WINNERSnd THE LOSERS, THE PERSON Of the year and we will handout the donald trump award to the person who has embarrassed him or herself the most this year. All right. Let's start with the most valuable player of the 2012 presidential campaign. Alex wagner, the most valuable player of the 2012 campaign. 
>> In my book, it's david pluf. I think this is a line in the sand for american campaign politics. I think, you know, you said beginnings of what with dean and certainly obama .10. 
>> Crystal, most valuable player of the 2012 campaign. 
>> I have to say we don't know exactly his identity or her yooidity, but the -- probably the waiter who placed the camera at the mitt romney fund-raiser and captured the 47% comments which I think encapsulated for a lot of people their concerns about mitt romney and the fact that he really wasn't there for all of america that he didn't understand the problems that average americans were facing. 
>> Let's listen to that little moment of videohistory, the 47%. 
>> There are 47% of the people who will vote for the president no matter what. All right. 47% who are with him, who are dependent upon government, who believe that they are victims, who believe the government has the responsibility to care for them, who believe that they are entitled to health care, to food, to housing, to you name it. So my job is not to worry about those people. They should take responsibility and care for their lives. 

[00:04:19]


>> A very valuable contribution to the campaign. 
>> I'm going go with bill clinton. 
>> For one speech at a convention? 
>> It was more than one speech. It was 20 years in the making the story of that speech was for the first 15 years they treated bill clinton like he was the worst thing that ever happened in american politics, villain in chief and even after he left the white house he was afraid of the clinton restoration and 2008 when obama had the clintons when the republicans decided, wait a minute, no, bill clin clin to is this bygone symbol in america of cooperation and good government and moderation and sang his praises for four years. Set him up as the good democrat against obama's bad democrat. What happened, the good democrat stole the show, vouches for the bad democrat and disarmed an awful lot of. Ares are saying about president obam 
>> chris hayes, the mvp of the campaign? 
>> The mvp of the obama campaign was rick per prip it was rick perry's entrance to the race that pushed mitt romney to take the tackically we but strategically stupid step of going full out elegant. 
>> Tackically wise for that moment. 
>> For that moment. It totally destroyed rick perry. He dispatched rick perry with that rhetoric with the $100,000 subdiddy to the illegals, the dream act which unallowed undocumented students to go to the university and pay in-state tuition. Romney destroyed rick perry on that issue. But it was in the rhetoric he deployed there I think he sealed his fate in the general election with latinos who he got blown out in and provided a huge margin in a lot of swing states. 
>> Great point. My choice is, of course, the anonymous videographer who captured the 47% tape which is why we happen to have that tape now. 
>> I was going to say you guys worked that out. 
>> Why it happened to be ready. Now, the best move of 2012. What was the best move of 2012? 
>> This is really hard because some part of me as a political junkie thinks the best move is the most incendiary crazy there, for that mitt romney moving across the stage and grabbing rick perry on the should. This physical debate style which also revealed him for crazy and not driven by the same things most humans are driven by but the competitive workforce bot. I think at the end of the day we keep going back to the 47% video. I was waiting to hold it. 

[00:06:44]


>> You can use it as much as you want. It will be back. 
>> It is everything. The release of that and the timing of that changed the contours of the face forever. 
>> We don't really know who was responsible for that timing. Crystal, test move. 
>> The best move, mine actually goes to chris' point about immigration. I think it was the president when he gave a press conference announcing that he would halt deportations on young undocumented immigrants and it really sort of closed off a path for mitt romney and trapped him over there on the right in self deportation, rick perry land. And he was not able to make any pivot back to the center to try to appeal to latino voters to try to strike a more reasonable position on immigration because the president basically cut him off at the pass. I think that was a very smart strategic move. 
>> Steve? 
>> I'll look at the step down to the senate level here. I THINK THE SMARTst AND THE BEST Move of the year was clear McCASKILL'S POSITION IN MISSOURI To say I think I want to run against todd aiken. I think he's the one republican in the state to get this year. The rest is history. Not only did it affect her race and help her win a race she had no business winning but there was obviously a ripple effect to help democrats nationally. 
>> Chris, the best move of the year. 
>> I think the best move of the year is joe biden, essentially never do which is answering the questiohonestly and without premeditation and in his "meet the press" interview with david gregory. Was this a trial balloon, was this preplanned, trying to gain it up? No, no, no. Joe biden was asked a question, he answered with a kind of moral legitimacy and a truthfulness that actually had these remarkable effects which is that it pushed the president to come clean about his own personal evolution. I think that also made a huge difference in the campaign. 
>> Joe biden. 
>> My best move of the campaign we act have a little visual assist on this. "Washington post" says, obama and his allies spent less on advertising than romney and his allies but got far more in the number of ads broadcast and visit in key markets and in targeting critical demographic groups such as the working class and young working voters in swing states. I thought what they did with tv advertising, specificity of t it knowing exactly what they were going is something we had never seen before. The wor move of the 2012 campaign. 

[00:09:12]


>> Two things on this. One is probably choosing paul ryan to be the vice presidential nominee. Just because, a, it never gave him the left that anyone thoht it would. He neutered ryan as a political force in the cmpaign and for paul ryan it brought to the floor the horrible draconian things he was pushing. The ryan budget, 2340 way to run away with it. 
>> Crystal? 
>> Alex and I are on the same wavelength here. I think picking paul ryan was the worst move not only for all those reasons and mitt romney went on to lose wisconsin badly but also there were questions particularly after paul ryan's debate performance against joe biden of whether he was really ready to step on the stage and to be the number two and I think for a lot of people who were thinking about maybe going with romney not only were they uncomfortable with how far to the right he was, how extreme his positions on social security and medicare, but they also just felt like he wasn't quite ready for prime time. I think it was a very bad strategic move for them. 
>> Steve, the worst move? 
>> Let me come at it from a slightly different angle. 
>> You ulz do. You don't have to preface it. 
>> It's the booze talking. I don't know. From the standpoint of voters who, you know, I think to make an informed choice what do you have, you have the debates. What do we have with the debates this year, jim lar for the moderator for the 16th time and he moderated the first debate which was the designated domestic policy debate in the domestic policy, broad, huge topic, you can have climate change, gay marriage, abortion, all of that was ignored and we talked about simpson bowls and the deficit reduction. 
>> Around no explanation of what those things were for the average person. 
>> Inside the beltway debate. You only get really one domestic policy debate now for the entire fall campaign. Open this thing up to new voices, to fresh perspective, to broader perspectives. I don't mean to pick on jim leyer but enough. 

[00:11:13]


>> The obama campaign and the not surprising decision of mitt romney and debate moderators to never raise climate change for the first time since 1988. If you go back to the tape in 1988 where dan quayle was asked about the fact carbon was warming the earth, yeah, that's going to be a problem, we should do something about it. Here we are 24 years later and it doesn't even get a mention in any of the debates. 
>> I have another video assist from my answer here. The worst move, the w decision of the campaign was to do what you're about to see at the republican convention. 
>> Oh. 
>> I just wondered, are all these promises and then i wondered about, you know, when the -- what? What do you want me to tell romney? I can't tell him to do that. I can't do that to himself. You're absolutely crazy. 
>>> Up next, the rising star of 2013, and the best and worst political theater of the presidential campaign, and, of course, biggest winner, bigger loser person of the year, and the donald trump award. ???????????? from Is bigger than we think ... like the flu. With aches, fever and chills- the flu's a really big deal. So why treat it like it's a little cold? There's something that works differently than over-the-counter remedies. Prescription TAMIFLU attacks the flu virus at its source. So don't wait. Call your doctor right away. TAMIFLU is prescription medicine for treating the flu in adults and children one year and older whose flu symptoms started within the last two days. Before taking TAMIFLU tell your doctor if you're pregnant, nursing. have serious health conditions, or take other medicines. If you develop an allergic reaction, a severe rash, or signs of unusual behavior, stop taking TAMIFLU and call your doctor immediately. Children and adolescents in particular may be at an increased risk of seizures, confusion or abnormal behavior. The most common side effects are mild to moderate nausea and vomiting. The flu comes on fast, so ask your doctor about TAMIFLU. Prescription for flu. younger, admit disease. I wanted to fit in, I wanted to be a normal kid. Because of my diabetes, st the sight in my left eye. Misconceptions continue to surround this monster public health issue. But the simple truth is, diabetes can often be prevented and complications avoided. I think if I had just been open and honest about what my challenges were, I think it would have been easier for me to take better care of myself. If you don't take care of yourself when you're younger, with this condition, it will catch up to you later on. You're going to find the courage to manage this disease for the rest of your life by reaching out for help. Reach out to people who care about you. Reach out to people who know how to help you with this disease. Not alone. Understand the realities of diabetes and know that you can manage it and lead a full, active life. 

[00:14:40]


>>> The rising political star of 2013, chris hayes, who will that be? 
>> Massachusetts senator elizabeth warren, I think. It's not an easy thing to do what she did. I think people -- she was a star on this network and among progressives but to go, particularly as a woman in massachusetts that takes some real doing and I think she is going to be an absolute for us in the u.S. Senate. 
>> Steve, the rising star? 
>> Pains me a bit to say because I'm not that -- 
>> say it. 
>> This is going to be the year with cory booker. 
>> Not just in new jersey. Crystal, the rising star. 
>> New congresswoman from hawaii, tulsy gavert. The youngest woman in the house and first u in congress. 
>> Alex, the rising star. 
>> I asked you to go with chris first because I thought it was going to provide me some cover. I was going to say elizabeth. 
>> Sure, you were. 
>> It's true. 
>> I'll tell you why. 
>> You want to give up going first again? 
>> I would like to go first. 
>> You will go first next time. I am going to agree with alex wagner, not chris hayes, alex wagner. We're going to be back with more of "the last word with holiday party." Stay with us. ???????????? ???????????? 

[00:17:24]


>>> they sent out their minions to do their bidding. Washington cannot tolerate threats from outsiders who might disrupt their comfortable world. The firefighter startered when the cowardly sensed a weakness. A lesser person could have survived the first few minutes of the onslaught. But out of the billowing smoke and dust have tweets and trivia emerged gingrich. 
>> That, of course, was the best actual political theater of 2012, tony award winner reading of a newt gingrich press release, I believe. Let's do the best political theater of 2012, and we are now going to start with alex wagner again because she has demanded that we start with her. 
>> It's a contractual obligation. 
>> Yeah. 
>> It was the best because i couldn't believe it was happening in mid august. Mitt romney took to the white board to explain what he was doing with medicare. 
>> I loved that. 
>> Which in and of itself was a hoax. But the notion that this man would have this horribly staged managed moment in an effort to show that he was all about business, completely blew up in his face and cemented I've ri narrative out there. 
>> I don't know if mikes can pick it up but drinks are being spilled over there. 
>> Party fouls. 
>> Crystal ball, the best political theater. 
>> Well, I also have a newt gingrich moment. When he turned questions about him asking his former wife for an open marriage. Parlayed that into a debate moment of huge applause moment at a debate in the primary and then parlayed that into an actual victory in the south carolina primary. Incredible. 
>> We happen to have that video queued up. Let's take a look at newt. 
>> She says you asked her, sir, to enter into an open marriage. Would you like to take some time to respond to that? 

[00:19:29]


>> No, but I will. 
[ Applause ] I think -- I think destructive, vicious, negative nature of the much of the news media makes it harder to govern this country, harder for decent people to run for this office. I am appalled that you would begin a presidential debate on a topic like that. 
>> That was obviously my choice, too, for best political theater. That's why we have that ready. Steve, best political theater. 
>> I remember my favorite thing about that episode is in the reporting afterwards, gingrich went up to john king and said, no hard feelings. It really was there. 
>> Very helpful to him. 
>> It really was theater. My favorite moment in political theater, I guess, was in the final presidential debate when mitt romney thought he had landed the killer blow against barack obama. 
>> Oh, yes. 
>> On libya. 
>> Oh, yes. 
>> Failure to call it terrorist attack. 
>> Started physically closing in. 
>> In line when obama knew exactly what was happening, exactly the trap that romney was falling for. He said, governor, proceed. 
>> Please proceed, governor. 
>> We don't have that cued up. Chris? 
>> I thought the entire democratic convention was really flawlessly done from pure theatricallies, compared to the republican convention that i thought it was a theatrical disaster, we built that, yes, we did, we did. I thought that backfired. I thought bill clinton's speech was political theater at its best insofar as it was genuinely edifying. He was not afraid, he didn't do the cheap and easy thing which was to do something surfacey. He went into the weeds of the details of the policy and explained them and it actually made for great theater. 
>> Worst political theater. >>! I can't believe we haven't mentioned this before. Herman cain's entire campaign. It was a hoax. He wasn't actually really running. He was an actor on the national stage. He had command of his audience. At the end of the day, it was theater. 

[00:21:38]


>> Worst? 
>> This is water before I get a lot of tweets. 
>> We are the water drinkers. 
>> Water team. Worst political theater, I would say after the 47% comments came out and mitt romney decided to do this hurried press conference where he looked frazzled, the hair was a little eskew and he had nothing to say and essentially dug the hole deeper for himself. I think that was the worst political theater of the campaign. Other than clint eastward, of course. 
>> Right before the critical michigan primary, the romney campaign is a little bit on the roips. Rick santorum polled on the polls. The romney campaign said we're going to pull this around with a major economic speech and they went down to the detroit lions football stadium, about .002% full. The wide shot was one of the most hilarious things I've ever seen. 
>> The worst political theater i think was the numbers in the president's campaign in the spin room after the first debate in denver. Very, very, very gamely attempting -- attempting to put a happy face. 
>> For me it was a particular moment ie herman cain campaign. It was kind of when -- it was when he had stuff twirling around in his head and we're going to look at that right now. 
>> So you agree with president obama on libya or not? 
>> Okay. Libya. President obama supported the uprising, correct? I do not agree with the way he handled it for the following reason. No, that's a different one. I got to go back and see. 
>> Oh. 

[00:23:39]


>> I got all of this stuff twirling around in my head. 
>> Oh, we missed him so badly. We're going ba b.

>>> And the sorry to see you go ca. Chris hayes? 
>> Legendary major league baseball union president marvin mill whole died this year at 95. I got the pleasure of interviewing him last year when I was working my book. Totally and completely transformed andrevolutionized both major league baseball and professional sports and converted a system which was essentially endentured serve tuesday where owners could pay players nothing into the modern free agency system in which players would recoup a fair market value. 

[00:28:13]


>> Steve, sorry to see you go? 
>> You probably haven't heard of him but joe early, a congressman from massachusetts my kind of politician and my kind of congressman me cared about the city that's a tough city. He brought lots of money back and projects back and lost his career in a trumped up, fake scandal that rick santorum and john boehner created in the '90s. He lost his career, reputation, put on trial, exonerated but spent the last 20 years of his life totally unappreciated and died this year. He deserved a little bit of regular cognition, joe early. 
>> Phyllis diller. Amazing trailblazing comedian. 
>> She was. 
>> Alex, sorry to see you go? 
>> I have two. george McGovern and rob gi shank gl guard. Very different men. 
>> I'm very sorry to see go whitney houston. 
>> Yeah. 
>>> We're going to be back with more of our "last word holiday show." ???????????? defies? Red jars are all the same right? Wrong! You need three uses of a $15 cream to equal the moisturizing power of one use of regenerist microsculpting cream. Seems not all red jars are created equal. Olay regenerist. america. We don't let frequent heartburn come between us and what we love. So if you're one of them people who gets heartburn and then treats day after day... Block the acid with prilosec otc and don't get heartburn in the first place! 

[00:32:13]


[ Male Announcer ] ONE PILL EACH MORNING. 24 hours. Zero heartburn. ???????????? 
>>> welcome back to. 
>> Reporter: "The last word" holiday party. Our new category is the biggest surprise of 2012. Karen finney, what was the biggest surprisef 2012? 
>> That we were able to call the election right around 11:00. 
>> You know, I wasn't surprised by that. 
>> Wow weren't surprised? 
>> I actually thought that's what was going to happen. 
>> I literally had thought that it was going to be a much longer night. 
>> Most people did. 
>> I thought it was going to be a much bigger mess. I did not think the president was going to win without us having some debacle in florida. Thankfully we did. 
>> Joy reid, the biggest surprise. 
>> The biggest surprise is that mitt romney actually chose paul ryan as his running mate. I have to say I said on the very last word, the after show to this show and I think I was with ari, you know, who should romney pick, pick paul ryan. Ideologically he's the right guy. But is the democrat secretly? I was like, oh, please, pick paul ryan. I didn't think he would do it. 
>> There were so many reasons not to pick him. 
>> So many reasons not to pick him. As a democrat it was the perfect thing because it crystalized all the things that democrats didn't like about mitt romney and that the case they wanted to make about him this sort of distaste for the ordinary person, for the 47%, the idea of voucherizing medicare, all of that suz crystalized in one person. And he picked him to be his running mate. I was very surprised. 
>> Ari, biggest surprise of 2012. 
>> The biggest surprise to me was something that was way behind the scenes. The debate commission makes these rules and usually secret. This year they leaked, first on time and goinger.Com. You can read these rules. Turns out the debate rules restrict the moderator from doing any fact checking or any commenting or response to the answers the candidates give. We never knew that before because it's the between the candidates and the commission. 'S crooked and I think sort of very untransparent in a lot of ways. We learned that. The next cycle there's going to be a lot of pressure to change the rules. 

[00:34:32]


>> I hate the rules and did a couple of rewrites on the show about the rules. My biggest surprise of 2012 was president obama's performance in the first debate. I kind of went -- 
>> horrifying. 
>> Everyone's biggest. 
>> It didn't completely start to settle on me until we were about 50 minutes in that, you know, because I was kind of -- you're kind ofaiting for the engine to start. 
>> He's going to -- 
>> it didn't quite -- yeah. 
>> It's going to -- and then did it. 
>> It was amazing. 
>> I think that they were so confident in their math in the obama campaign that he didn't go into that debate taking it all that seriously and I don't think he thought, why am I here with this guy. 
>> It's that incumbent president thing. That first debate is always, oh, boy, I'm so out of shape with this. 
>> Rusty. 
>> He didn't take eye contact seriously either. He was sort of -- 
>> yeah. No here's the -- this comes to our annual donald trump award. Donald trump has been winning this award for the last 20 years on this show so it's been named after him. It is the most embarrassing, the person who has embarrassed himself or herself the most in the year 2012. So for you, karen, this year the donald trump award goes to? 
>> Oh, I got to say herman cain. 
>> Yeah. 
>> In that interview. 
>> Yeah. 
>> And he couldn't remember. 
>> In that video we just saw, yeah. 
>> Maybe a close second with governor perry with trying to remember the three agencies. Ouch, ouch, ouch. It just hurt. It hurt. 
>> The difference is perry actually was running for president, cain was running for fame. Joy, the donald trump award. 
>> Since karen has taken my two I'm going to go with john sununu. He was the worth surrogate I've ever seen in my life. 
>> It is so good to be rid of him. 
>> And he was everything that's wrong with the republican party's brand. Surly and con descending and racially insensitive and ugly and he was awful and he kept talking. 
>> Ari, the donald trump award goes to who this year? 

[00:36:35]


>> Karl rove -- 
>> on election night? 
>> Yes. 
>> On politics. Both. On politics on election night he had no idea what was going on. On policy this was if year we really saw the public turn against his enduring legacy to go against people who happen to be gay. The public and the republican party turning against that. That's going to be hig his legacy sadly for a long time. 
>> For 20 years on the show the donald trump award has gone to donald trump. Once again, I feel I will be giving it to donald trump because I do find it impossible to updo donald trump on embarrassing yourself. There are a couple of people who tried. They trooid really hard to outdo donald trump. Let's take a look at, for example, todd akin. 
>> Yeah. 
>> First of all, from what i understand from doctors, that's really rare. If it's a legitimate rape, the female body has ways to try to shut that whole thing down. 
>> Just when you thought he had that whole jurisdiction wrapped up, there came richard murdoch who we should also take a look at. 
>> I think even when life begins in that horrible situation in rape, that it is something that god intended to happen. 
>> They are legitimate runners up for t donald trump award. 
>> They are. 
>> Every time I hear that it sounds like he's not doing well, on top of it. 
>> Okay. 
>> There were a number of male, mostly male, republican legislators in state legislatures across the country who made similar comments who remain nameless, hat tip for being just that stupid about women. 
>> All the people who wrote the republican party's platform this year. They completely agreed with them so none of them could escape it. 
>>> Coming up, the person who we are not sorry to see go. Also, we will be picking the person of the year, biggest winner, biggest loser. Stay with us. ???????????? 

[00:40:47]


>>> and now for the not sorry to see you go category. Ari, who are you not sorry to see go? 
>> Allen west. 
>> Took mine. 
>> You took my answer. 
>> Mine, too. 
>> Now people know this is real. 
>> Alan west, yeah. You got -- joy? 
>> That was my answer. 
>> Runner-up? 
>> I guess my runner-up is now going to have to be dick morris. I think we're rid of him. 
>> Are we? I don't know. 
>> He's sort of like -- he's hibernating. 
>> Really? 
>> Yeah. 
>> Maybe he can oblige us and not go away. 
>> Karen finney? 
>> I think I'm going to have to go with jim demint. 
>> He is going to disappear. This nonsense of this is a better job is going to go run a stupid foundation in d.C. 
>> Go I head. 
>> It's actually kind of great to get rid of him. The people who are really not sorry to see him go are republicans in the senate who he was driving crazy. Democrats in the senat actually liked having him not like that to kind of paint the whole party. 
>> Can I give a runner-up now? 
>> Please. 
>> The tea party. The funny hats, the tea bags hanging from their hats and the loud, obnoxious rallies. 
>> They have a functionally disappeared. They had nothing to say during the fiscal cliff crisis. 
>>> We're going to be back with the person of the year, biggest winner, biggest loser. A lot more, stay with us. ???????????? soft. This is so so soft. Hey hun, remember you only need a few sheets. TtVWKUN+og#WVS#q'PPU;V?2V.AC=u0L4'p/Wl??k??0K9%"@NKGH@??jD14 Hmph!

[00:43:57]


>>> Welcome back to "last word" holiday party. It is now time fhe person of the year award. Ari, who is the person of the year? 
>> I was thinking about this. It's a night for celebration but I think it's also a night to honor people. For me when you look at 2012 it would be congresswoman gabby giffords. She resigned this year after a heroic battle dealing with the gunshot wounds that she experienced. We obviously keep her in our thoughts and our prayers. But she was also a leader and believed in public policy and we're going to have to look as we go forward into the next year over how we deal with this enduring problem of gun violence in our country. 
>> Your person of the year? 
>> This may sound corny but i picked the american voter. I say that because -- does sound corny. 
>> It does sound corny. I know. It is corny. 
>> I can't lie. It does. 
>> It is corny. The reason I said it is because -- 
>> you said group, not the country. 
>> The reason is -5 
>> very "time" magazine. 
>> It is. 
>> But I never in my lifetime and I have seen people have to endure so many hoops, so many hurdles. 
>> Seven hours in line. 
>> Seven hours in line. And just the overt -- I've never seen it so overt. Whether it was in ohio where you have secretary of state there. 
>> This is not corny. 
>> People literally fought against the right to vote this term -- this cycle more than I've ever seen in my life. I felt like I was being TRANSPORTED BACK TO THE 1960s OR THE '50s. And in florida where they passed legislation to prevent black voters, specifically, from getting to vote in ohio where the secretary of state did everything including going to the supreme court to prevent people from being able to vote early. I thought people's resilience, people's resolve, people's determination. I met 60-year-old people, older women, people who had disability who said, I'm staying in line if it has to be all day. I was very proud of them. So that was my -- it's corny. 
>> No, it's not. You beat me on that. 
>> The images were the most powerful. People waiting in line. 
>> Your person of the year? 
>> Mine was malala. She's so courageous and she reminded us in the middle of a rid choice election season about things that are far more important in terms of who the big struggles in this world are about and particularly at a time when republicans were trying to tell women that this war on women is all in our heads, i think it was a good reminder in women what we have fought for. 

[00:46:13]


>> She was shot in the head by the pack stn any taliban because s education for girls and womens. We have that video. Let's look at that. 
>> I have a new dream. So I have thought that I must be a politician to sell this try. 
>> Why did you change this dream? 
>> Because there are so many crieses in our country so I want to remove these crises and to save my country. 
>> And I notice there's a little person of the year bug on the video there because she is my choice of person of year, which is why we have that video ready to go. Crystal ball, you're person of the year? 
>> You can just say I agree. No, you can't. 
>> I have to go with -- I know mine is corny, too. I have to go with president obama. He really survived a lot of adversity. He really, I think, was vindicated in a lot of ways. 
>> You have to make the case for the president being the person of the year. 
>> Yeah. 
>> Alex wagner, your person of the year. 
>> I'm really boring but I would echo crystal because I think he has come forred himself with so much integrity and honestly and kindness. 
>> Steve, you're the tiebreaker. Two for malala over here. 
>> I'm t not breaking a tie I'm going out on my own, "family feud" style and I'm going to say john roberts, the supreme court chief justice because at the height of an election season with immense pressure from the conservative movement and peer pressure from within the court this guy said the affordable care act, it stands. 
>> All right. Good point. 
>> Coming up, the get ready for this, we're going to have the biggest winner, the biggest loser. The different concept than person of the year. That's up. Coming up, more of "the last word" holiday party.@ 

[00:51:12]


>>> has been by new year. I have breaking news. It's just before 2:00 a.M. On the east coast. We're just barely two hours into the new year. And though we've now technically gone over the fiscal cliff, the senate is voting on a bipartisan compromise. The agreement which was hammered out by vice president joe biden and republican senate minority LEADER mitch McConnell would extend tax breaks for people earning less than $400,000 a year or $450,000 for families. It would extend unemployment benefits for a year, and automatic federal spending cuts known as sequester will be delayed for two months and paid for with a combination of tax increases and spending cuts. As you can see, the motion that's taking place on the floor right now, that vote is taking place and we're waiting to hear what the results of that will be. Now, in a meeting on monday, vice president biden spent 90 minutes selling the plan for senate democrats and he has said he is optimistic about the results of this and now we are waiting to see if it turns out that he was correct about that. We're joined now on the phone by congressional correspondent mike, who has a lot more insight into exactly what's taking place here. Mike, happy new year to you. 
>> Happy new year. This is really incredible. The senate is moving at electric pace here. At least for the senate. Now, you might think that's a funny thing to say considering these negotiations have dragged on since virtually the day after the election. Everybody knew that this so-called fiscal cliff loomed. There was a lot of positioning and posturing all over the course of second half of november and leading up really up until the last few days when vice president biden received a call from the republican leader mitch McConnell and at long last they got to serious negotiations. And just we're watching this vote as it happens right now. Listening to the roll call. It appears that it's going to pass with overwhelming support in the united states senate. Obviously we have technically gone over the fiscal cliff at this point. However, this will be retroactive to, what, an hour and 53 minutes ago on the east coast. So it would be no effect, with one big caveat, of course. Next comes the house of representatives and nobody knows how that is going to work out. Republican leaders, after this deal was struck this evening, it became apparent that both republicans and democrats were on board in big numbers. Put out a statement saying they pledge to look at what the senate did. They reserve the right to amend it, however, or put it directly on the floor. They're not going to do it tonight. This is going to take place tomorrow at the very earliest and no one knows exactly how republicans are going to react in the house of representatives. It is going to be a very inresting day. And at this point we can't say it's a guarantee in any way, shape, or form that the house is going to approve what's being done here. Many republicans obviously upset that taxes are going to be very in any shape or form and many democrats are upset that the president came off his original numbers. The president had campaigned on $250,000 number for married couples, over which folks would have their taxes raised. In the course of negotiations, it has now come to $400,000 as you reported for individuals, $450,000 for those filing jointly. Over that level, any monies made over that mop any will be taxed at now a 39.6% rate instead of a 35% rate. Essentially going back to the clinton era rates, before the bush administration initiated their tax cuts. Many democrats were angry about that. We had one tom harken take the floor and voice his opposition. But it is flying through the senate now. It looks like it's going to pass with overwhelming support. It's going to put john boehner, the republican speaker of the house, in a very tough jam. Folks want this to happen. This deal has been struck. And maura, one other thing, these mandatory cuts, you may have heard of them called the sequester that were to go into effect today that were the result of the last budget deal that they made. They were to be delayed for two months that will coincide with the debt ceiling that needed to be raised. The united states exceeding its federal debt. That requires an act of congress to raise it. So all of these things are going to come together in two months time and people are already now predicting a fight, if you can believe this, even bigger than the one we've just witnessed over the past several weeks, maura. 

[00:55:52]


>> And looking forward to what happens next, you mentioned the house and both speaker boehner and nancy pelosi said they would consider the plan, although nancy pelosi did not go as far as to endorse it. What can we expect in terms of the house as far as how we can receive this? 
>> I've got to tell you, the veteran congressional watcher, i am fascinated to see what the house is going to do. Here's the argument republican leaders made in the senate and are likely to make in the house tomorrow. Yes, this is a horrible bill for us. We're asking many of you to vote against fundamental, a very basic tenant of your political belief, your philosophy, and that is never to vote, to raise taxes in any way, shape or form although technically, we should -- 
>> I just want to cut you off to report the breaking news that the senate has now approved this budget deal. So, based on that new information that we have, what happens now? Explain to us where this goes? 
>> Sure, it goes to the house of representatives. This does not take effect, obviously, until both the senate and house have voted on identical pieces of legislation. So the question is will the house take up this identical piece of legislation tomorrow? Or will they take this bill up and try to amend it. John boehner has pledged to look at this bill and give the house of representatives a chance to look at it. What I was about to say is what he's likely to tell them is this is a lousy deal. You're violating a basic principle. We're asking you to vote to raise taxes, but we will live to fight another day, in two months, precisely, when the debt ceiling vote has to come and those automatic cuts are going to be coming due. The administration already expects that. The president says he's never going to negotiate over that debt ceiling again. 
>> Now, this is being billed as a bipartisan compromise, compromise being the keyword there when the president wanted to campaign on those making over $250,000. So in terms of winners and losers here, if we can break it down, simply who has had to give up a significant amount? And who has been able to win on key points for them and their constituents? 

[00:58:10]


>> I think it's a mixed bag for a lot of people. Let's start with mitch McCONNELL'S REPUBLICAN LEADER. He's got a race in two years. He can see a primary from the conservative side. Certainly joe biden comes out 06 this looking great. He came in sort of his superman of the underdog flying in at the last minute to save the day. The president, a mixed bag although he really played his hand to the maximum. A lot of people looked at this and thought he learned his lessons from previous perusing budget battles, health care battles, stimulus battles and republicans in congress and really had them in a corner, had them boxed in really well. However, some of his supporters, you already hear them expressing a great deal of dismay. There was a statement saying he should have stuck to his 250. And just a cursory look at twitter, many people are similarly upset. John boehner, this is a tough spot for john boehner. The house and a lot of people have said that his speakership could be threatened by this. So far, we see no sign of that. But, you know, he's in a position now where he is going to have to allow this -- probably going to have to allow this bill to hit the floor and the house and not going to get a majority of republican support. That is something that no speaker of the house of representatives, whether republican or democrat, does with any kind of frequency at all. It's considered almost a heresy. So, you know, everybody sort of recognizes the box that john boehner is in, but it's not going to really do him any good in terms of support among conservatives. There are some winners and losers here. But this fight is not over,

Webernard goldberg and dennis miller in a very special factor. I've been working with you too long. 
>> Like giving birth to a pineapple with two satellites connected to it. 
>> And the jimmy kimmel's comedy. 
>> Jimmy kimmel knows who his audience is, democratic and liberal-- 
>> and california out lawed and misfed at point and it tastes good. 
>> Fasten the seat belts. 
>> Take the little end and stick it in the big end. 
>> Caution, you're about to enter the no spin zone. The factor begins right now. 
>> ???????????? 
>> hi, I'm bill o'reilly, thanks for watching us tonight. The best of our dynamic duo edition, bernard goldberg and dennis miller. We begin this evening with bernie, why dan rather canceled 24 hours before he was supposed to sit down with me. Roll the tape. 42, I'm not at cbs now because I and my team reported a true story, it was a tough story, a tire a lot of people didn't want to believe and was subjected to a terrific propaganda barrage to discredit it. And avoided the truth and that president later president bush national guard, awol and a tough army general saying on the record he was a desserter. 
>> And before we get to why you think rather might have canceled, the first question i would ask him off what he said on good morning america, you litigated this to the tune of a couple million dollars and you lost, you lost in a court of law. Your assertion was not, was not deemed credible because if it had been, you would have won. And cbs would have dismissed you without cause and you would have won a huge judgment. How do you square it? That's the kind of question i would like to ask him and he's not going to be on the program and I think that's why he canceled. 

[00:02:20]


>> Well, first of all, I don't blame him for canceling. I was thinking a few hours ago of canceling myself. 
(Laughter) 
>> no, but here is my educated, but I think safe guess, I think dan would rather be interviewed by an ideological soulmate whether it's george stephanopoulos or chris mathews or something like that, rather than sit down and be grilled by you. Now, everybody knows how charming, lovable you are, bill, but still, I don't think he'd want to sit down and be grilled by you. So, I don't think it's really that complicated. I think it's-- 
>> it takes me aback -- it takes me whatever I want to say, I don't even know, it takes me by surprise because rather made his reputation by being confrontational. We all remember the nixon thing a0 minutes, he would run over with a trench coat. And o'reilly second biggest book seller next to the today show, and if I kicked o'reilly's butt, okay? I'll look like a hero in front of my crew. So, it's a win-win for me, dan rather. That's the way I would think. He had a lot to gain here. 
>> You would think so, I mean, he took on in what turned out to be a disaster, he took on george bush, the elder, on the cbs evening news and he sat down face-to-face with saddam hussein, who could have had him killed before he left the country, but I know that -- i know it doesn't sound logical, but I think he's more comfortable with sitting down with a murderer like saddam hussein than he is -- I know, I you know what I'm going to say, than you. 
>> And the only reason people cancel. 
>> Bill: Yeah. 
>> Because they have a conflict of scheduling and that wasn't it because he could have said, how about if I do it some other time. 

[00:04:26]


>> Bill: We would have taped him. 
>> He doesn't want to do it. 
>> Bill: And he doesn't want to do it. 
>> You said he spent a couple of million dollars. No, in the interview that he did with some print or online thing, the person said you spent 5 million dollars on this case, and rather said i wish it were only 5 million, it was more than that. 
>> Bill: Wow. 
>> So you know what? You know what? Here is a guy -- here is a man who covered every major story since the assassination of jfk. He has put his life in danger more than a few times, and i think he's painfully aware of the fact that some day down the road, when somebody writes the obit for dan rather, in the first paragraph it's going to contain the words, either memo-gate or rather-gate or something like this and i think that hurts him terribly. 
>> Bill: He could have rabid it here. You say that the media did not defeat mitt romney, but it d help president obama, explain that? 
>> Yeah, were there reporters, a lot of reporters who were rooting for barack obama? Absolutely, no question. But did mitt romney lose because of that? No, but no with an asterisk, let's take one example, benghazi. The media played down that story. If they had played it up that could have been a big deal, could have been a game changer, could have swayed the election. Mitt romney didn't either, and he decided after the first presidential debate to play it safe, run out the clock, bad strategy and then the hurricane and the embrace with the governor, and the president, lights out. Here is where the asterisk is, and media did affect the election. When president obama-- when president obama decided he wanted to run for president, the mia decided they were going to fall in love with him. He were going to create an image of somebody who was bigger, better, different, smarter, than any other politicians who came before him. He wasn't even a politician, as far as they were concerned. He was-- there was a chum in the wall street journal that described him as america's first cult personality president. It worked, bill. The pr campaign that the media crafted worked. Obama got reelected. But, here is the final point on this. When you have this messiah-type figure who also has a goody bag, who's handing out free stuff to people. Hey, you want contraceptives? Hey, they're free, I'll give it to you. You want money? I'll take it from this guy and give it to these people. That's a tough candidate to beat and the media created that image, which is totally false, he is a politician, at times a very nasty politician, but they created a kind of mother teresa character and it worked. 

[00:07:24]


>> Moses, I think more moses than mother teresa,'s coming down, he's got the tablets, this is how we're going to do it, it's all going to work out. That's very good astute analysis. All right. Inside the republican party there's a lot of anger and bitterness and finger pointing and blaming and we've got to change and what do you say? 
>> Well, I say, first of all, you're absolutely right in what you said just now. What we're going to hear and we've already started hearing it, we nominated a moderate four years ago, it didn't work. We nominated a moderate this time, it didn't work. Now, we need a real conservative and if by real, they mean the most conservative candidate available, that will be a very, very big sting, because pat buchanan, to use an example, was the most conservative in recent memory, he never became president and never won the support of most republicans. Here is where the problem comes in, the republicans need a conservative with charisma, and it's got to be the kind of candidate who is smart enough to explain to these groups, like women, latinos, young voters, and they have to stop this bible-based bashing of gay people. They have to bring these people in without, without selling out their conservative-- 
>> that's the hard part because look. 
>> It's not going to be easy. 
>> Bill: And in order to get them in the tent, many of them, you've got to throw the abortion issue right out the window and that's a core fundamental belief. 
>> That's the problem. 
>> Bill: Go ahead. 
>> That's the problem, no, you're absolutely right, absolutely. Abortion should be be throw out the window, not as an issue, but you could still be pro-life and say, hey, this is not one of the things I'm going to be talking about during the campaign. You don't sell out your pro-life principles, but you don't make abortion a big issue because there are too many women out there who say, you know, there's a war on women. 

[00:09:31]


>> I've got to run this jimmy kimmel clip because it says something about the correspondents audience at the soiree on saturday night. 
>> Bill o'reilly wrote a controversial book about another great president called "killing lincoln." I actually have my own theory about lincoln's death, I think john wilks booth was innocent. I think it wasn't an assassination, I think he had an idea what the republican party would become in 150 years and he shot himself. 
>> Bill: All right, applause and wild laughter. Is this because the correspondents are overwhelmingly liberal and democrat? 
>> Yes. 
(Laughter) 
>> that's it? 
>> Yeah, I mean, yes, it is it. That is it, actually. Jimmy kimmel is a pro, he knows who his audience is, he knows that they're overwhelmingly liberal and democratic and he also knows that this president spoke to the same audience just a few years ago and said many of you covered my campaign and all of you voted for me and they weren't even embarrassed. They applauded, that's right. They applauded. 
>> Bill: Right. 
>> They applauded, exactly. So, I think kimmel, look, this joke was funny. If you're a liberal democrat and that's who was in the audience, overwhelmingly. 
>> Next up, bernie goldberg sounoff on the media's reaction to the rumble. Because the media who have had jon stewart, they loved it, they were willing to tolerate you. 
>> And later, dennis miller has thoughts on louis farrakhan and nancy pelosi. Everybody hide on this one. ] health plays a key role throughout our lives. One A Day Men's 50+ IS A COMPLETE MULTIVITAMIN Designed for men's health concerns as we age. It has 7 antioxidants to support cell health. One A Day Men's 50+. ] foods that make kids happy. And even fewer that make moms happy too. With wholesome noodles and bite sized chicken, nothing brings you together like chicken noodle soup from campbell's. It's amazing what soup can do. 

[00:13:16]


>> Bill: Thanks for 
>> thanks nor staying with us and the bernie segment. Bring in bernard goldberg from north carolina. Starting with the rumble. 
>> We're starting with the-- 
>> the bigger one. 
>> All right, you're not going to agree with me. Reasonable people may disagree, so please, don't go barney frank on me, okay? I think this, this debate is one more piece of evidence that we live in an entertainment culture. The new york times covered this, the l.A. Times, wall street journal, "the washington post," following stone, guardian over in england covered this, by the way, they called you a right-wing blow hard. 
>> Bill: What a shock. It's communist paper as far left as you can get. 
>> Far left paper, no question. 
>> Bill: Right. 
>> Websites all around the world covered it and I think they covered it because you two, you and jon stewart, put on a good show and the media loves a good show because you bring in an audience and he brings in an audience and all of these other news organizations want to run, you know, play off of your coat tails and get hits on their website and increase circulation, however they cover this thing. So, I think, I think even if two intellectual giants, like william f buckley, and gore vidale were still with us and held a 90-minute debate it wouldn't get as much attention as the debate that you and jon stewart got. 
>> Bill: Okay. 
>> I'm just saying, all right? The second point I want to make is that because the media loves jon stewart and they really love him, they were willing to tolerate you. 
(Laughter) 
>> it could have been anybody, right? 
>> Well, something like that, but if jon stewart -- in jon stewart ever came out and flat-out said and meant ti don't like bill o'reilly -- now, I know he professes to like you which I'm not at all convinced he's telling the truth about, if he came out and said, no, I don't like him, I think he's a jerk shall the media would have caught you up in that debate. Because they like stewart, they went easy on the-- just the encapslation of the event? 

[00:15:45]


>> My only point is the reason this got-- it sounds crazy to me, the reason it it got worldwide attention is because of the entertainment value. 
>> Bill: I'm not arguing that and because of the charisma of the performance. You can't discount-- 
>> jon stewart is very charismatic. 
>> Bill: He is. So I'm watching 60 minutes last night on the navy seal who shot bin laden and i thought it was a pretty straight report, no spin. 
>> I watched the interview, i found it riveting television, no opinions, no slant, no raised eyebrows. Scott pelley, the reporter, who had a seal who was actually there during the raid. He asked questions the way you should and he let the guy tell his story. And I think in addition to them doing it right, I can it was important because you remember when it first came out that bin laden was killed, I mean, there were all sorts of versions of it. He was watching tv he threw his wife in front of him. The seal with the gun, there was a 45 minute gun fight, so all of these supposed facts weren't facts at all. Last night, the seal told the story and in his book he tells the storyf what happened. Bin laden stuck his head out the door, blooshot him in the head. He was twitching on the ground. The seal shoot him a few more times, it was serious television done the right way. 
>> Bill: Okay. And the reason that -- because bernie and I criticize, not only cbs news, they've turned it around, since pelley took over and jeff fagar, once in a while through the left, culture of course from all of them is a liberal culture inside the operation, but i think cbs is trying to be fair-minded. Now, I don't see any bias over there, do you?

>> No, I think you're right on two points, and the first point you made is a really upon one. I know jeff and I know that he's not an ideologue, and he's trying to turn it around, but I know there's a culture and this is an important point you make, there's a culture of liberalism-- 
>> for decades. 
>> That's right. And it does, it does come through more than it should in my view. 
>> Bill: Okay. Coming up, bernie and I chat about the sucss of fox news. 
>> I've got to be honest, i don't know what she was saying, if she was implying that you're in the tank, the only tank I could figure out you're in is in the bill o'reilly tank. 
>> Bill: Right back with you. S when cable networks hire. 

[00:21:15]


>> That's true there is co 
>> the bernie segment tonight, there was a discussion about political operatives hired by political news conferences as pundits. 
>> When cnn contributors, whether it's over at fox or be gala here or others at nsmnc and a-ha, she's speaking for obama and that's what they play when they hire people with a dual road. 
>> You saw glenn beck out at fox news and bill o'reilly and I think that damages the fox news brand. 
>> Bill: Well, it can't be too much damage to fox news brand, the highest rated prime time news program in the country and miss mason is obviously woefully uninformed, is this woman-- 
>> I have to take the factor and-- look, here is the thing, bill, the honest short answer is, i don't have a clue as to what she's talking about. Howie kirtz rbised a legitimate point when he talked about people who are motor commenttators on shows like this and political activists at the same time working for a party or a candidate, but the-- I mean, if she was implying, I've got to be honest, I don't know what she was saying, if she's implying you're in the tank, the only tank I can figure out you're in is in the bill o'reilly tank, you love bill o'reilly and. 
>> Bill: The shark tank. 
>> And butt in the down-- you never saw bill o'reilly under the bus. 
>> Bill: The question was fairly clear, as you defined. All right, you hire guys like begala and carville and karl rove, you're hiring a party, you're hiring the party guys, that's what they do and then when they come in they're looking at it it through the prism of the party and all of a sudden, this woman comes on and goes, glenn beck and bill o'reilly. Now, I'm certainly not in any party. 

[00:23:20]


>> But-- 
>> I am so tired of this branding fox news as a republican outfit. I can't tell you. 
>> Let me tell you what i think this is about, since her answer didn't make any sense. Let me give you an educated guess. I think you, you, bill o'reilly, have become the poster boy for every liberal complaint about anything on cable tv for a couple of reasons. Not because you're corrupt or you're the most biased person, it's because you're the most well-known person, that's the problem and of course, because you work for fox. Nobody out there is saying cable tv would be so much better if we could only get rid of dylan ratigan. I mean, people listening to us now are saying, who? Who did he just say? You're well-known, that's the price you pay for being well-known. It's garbage, I grant you there, but some free advice from a friend, if barack obama attacks you, if the new york times attacks you, if the pope attacks you, respond. If julie, julie mason-- 
>> it's not about here, it's about cnn that's what it's about. And cnn is a brand that goes all over the world and this is why I get annoyed and it's worth their while, they being the liberal media, that wants president obama, to marginalize an outfit that's not trying to get the president reelected. It's not trying to get anybody elected in my opinion. Yes, we have people who are pro republican on this network, but it's worth it for them to marginalize and that brings me to my bigger point. The media-- 
>> let me just say I don't think that howie kirtz was doing that. 
>> Bill: No, no, but he could have easily d you're crazy. O'reilly doesn't have anything to do with the republican party and nothing does beck. He could have done that. He knows that. 
>> He said something like that. 
>> Bill: He said some meli-mouthed thing. Didn't slap her down like he should. Enough of this. The larger point the folks get it. The folks know the media is it dishonest and the media is not in the business to report the news anymore or the news fit to print my you know what, they're there to advance ideological stuff. And if the polls say they know it, that means the press won't have any influence on the presidential election this time around. 

[00:25:41]


>> When you say the folks know it, I think what you really mean is the folks who pay attention. 
>> Bill: Folks who are polled, who are polled. 
>> Yeah, but the ones it may affect. It's not going to affect anybody who pays attention because liberal says that the media is in the tank for barack obama. The ones it may fect, let's be generous, and say who aren't paying close attention, who aren't sophisticated. When the media put on the short skirts as they did last time around and pompons and slant it in barack obama's favor, that may affect the less sophisticated people if they go out to vote. But it will be minimal, it will be at the margin, it will not, in my view, determine the outcome of the election. 
>> And it dsn't matter anymore with the new york times editorializing and we enforce selling so-- 
>> it matters a lot on the upper west side of manhattan and that's about it. 
>> What, are they going to be shocked up there? Come on. 
>> We're discussing the horrendous amount of violence in chicago and much of it in the black neighborhoods, i said this to our guest, reverend ira akree. 
>> When the civilnited states legislation wasn't kicked in, the black family was much more stable than it is today. 70% of black babies born out of wedlock and I think the number in 1960 was below 50%. So, things have gotten worse as the society has gotten more progressive. 
>> Well, we don't want to make it a racial-- >>, but that's what it is. It's black crime going on in chicago, and the percentage of out of wedlock births among black americans was 25% in 1965, was that a surveyor of bernard goldberg.Com. And the reverend clearly didn't want to address that. 
>> And I'm tempted to say understandably, but I think it's embarrassing. 72.5% out of wedlock birth rate in america today. 
>> Bill: For african-americans. 
>> For african-americans, that's embarrassing. And you know, in the entire recorded history of the planet, there has never been a greater voluntary abandonment of men from their children than this is today in black america, never. I mean, when men went off to war, they had to go off to war, that wasn't voluntary, but never as great a voluntary abandonment of children by their fathers than in black america today. 

[00:28:10]


>> Bill: Why do you think that's happening? 
>> Well, I think it's happening for -- if I have to pick the most important reason, it's fatherlessness. 
>> Bill: Perpetuates itself? If you don't have a father it's the same thing. 
>> You said yourself, it creates chaos, one of the reasons so many people killing themselves in chicago. 
>> Bill: It's my problem as a historian, out of historical point of view. 1960-65 was the time in america there was all kinds of civil rights problems. The black out of wedlock birth date then was 22 it to 25%. And this was the roughest, roughest part, okay? It's tripled now, tripled, why? 
>> One of the reasons -- I'll tell you why in a second. One of the reasons that they, the black community attributes to this, black civil rights leaders, is races. In 1940, when there was a lot of racism in the united states out of wedlock birth date was 19%, then in 1965, as you said, 65%. 
>> Bill:25. 25%, this coincides with the beginning of the great society welfare state. From 1965 until today it's gone up, it's gone up geometrically, so that's what happened. The government became the father. 
>> Bill: Next up, dennis miller and unforgettable moments from the past year. 
>> And the number one position continues to be hot blooded like foreigner, four weeks in a row top of the charts. 
>> Bill: You don't want to miss it. We're coming right back. Is a great reason to slow down. Creamy mash potatoes, homestyle gravy and 320 calories. Mar callender's. It's time to savor. ] day news starts with arthritis pain and a choice. Take tylenol or take aleve, the #1 recommended pain reliever by orthopedic doctors. Just two aleve can keep pain away all day. Back to the news. 

[00:31:52]


>> Tonight, sern california, president obama launching a drone on us and basically the president told the world I'm going to get whoever I want if I think the terrorists, you and I probably fall under that category and anybody else around you blown up and that's that, right? 
>> Well, listen, let's say the unmanned drone, the new hot tech item. This would be the iphone. Now, it's like the die-phone or something, and you know, everybody should have one. I kind of like how efficient it is. It's bloodless, makes nonsubjective decisions and get a hernia test from an unmned drone? And I see the president had to kill this this week and angry to find out I moved to number three, you're at four, and biden has been moved into the number two spot and that's ironic 'cause biden's secret service name is the unmanned drone if I'm not mistaken, number one continued to be hot blooded by foreigner, four weeks in a row at the top of the charts. ?????? I'm hot blooded check it and see ?????? u. 
>> Bill: Celebrities couples, forbes magazine making a lot of money together, all right? Number one, beyonce and jay-z apparently make 78 million dollars in a year ending may, 2. And you, do you believe that, first of all? 78 million, these two? 
>> Well, probably, I'm sure, billy. I don't know much about him. To me, they might as well call him jay-z zz because it's a bit after snooze. And they say he's a genius and alicia keyes and he starts talking. . 
[Rapping] 

[00:33:53]


>> if he's making 78 million off of that, his a freakin' genius. Two spot, tom brady, a complete mench and next to my wife, the hottest woman. Gisele. And 72 million. 
>> Most of that's got to come from her. I think that brady for 15 or 16 with the patriots. So, she's a big breadwinner there and victoria and david beckham. 
>> Well, this one I don't get, 54 million. 
>> The lasme he hooked a goal was, you know, back in the early '60s, I believe. 
>> And . 
>> And the simple fact is she appears to be one of the four or five least interesting people who lived in the history of the planet earth and that look on her face that-- 
>> spice girl, and at the olympics-- 
>> I don't think that somebody tightened the lid on that spice girl, getting a little old and he's running around, one tad away from being the chief harpooner on the watch. And the two first I get, i don't get him. 
>> Brad pitt angelina jolie and will pinkett and jada. 
>> And brad hit and his wife angelina jolie, big heroes, i think they do the right thing. I admire them immensely. 
>> Do you think this story has a happy ending? 
>> Happy endings are for-- 
>> miller, I have to confess, I don't eat a lot of french food because I heard if you do, you're spelled to wear a beret and I don't like the look. 
>> Foi gras, is that how you say it. 
>> It's the goose liver and shoot it with food and make the liver fatter. Tastes great. You can't have it in california and listen, I know when my head hits the pillow the at night I shouldn't be able to sleep bause you know, daffy-- 

[00:36:00]


>> let's running through that again. 
>> And self-serve island gets fred grain out the wazoo. 
>> Sorry. 
>> We're talking about a world where we're taking some of the kids in these countries and doing most atrocious things to them. I mean, they're geese at some point. It tastes good. Give it a the shot, that's all I have to say. 
>> Bill: The streak, california outlawed foi gras because it's misfed? 
>> And everybody else in california, but the goose has too much food in it. The goose in new york city can't buy a 16-ounce soda and the geese are outraged. And they're flying back, they need a big gulp right now. 
>> Bill: Have you ever been goosed on the subway? Trust me, it's worth a lot more. 
>> Aflac. 
>> Next up. What does miller thing about farrakhan's rant over fast food? 
>> One man's slime is another man's roughage. 
>> Bill: More miller in a moment. Ten to me. Listen to these happy progressive customers. I plugged in snapshot, and 30 days later, I was saving big on car insurance. With snapshot, I knew what I could save before I switched to progressive. The better I drive, the more I save. I wish our company had something this cool. You're not filming this, are you? Aw!

>> thanks for staying with us. In the personal story segment tonight. From time to time we put together highlights of our poll dennis miller doing whatever he does. Two reasons, number one, sometimes it's hard to understand miller the first time around and number two, sometimes what he says is worth hearing again. Prince william and his wife kate middleton expecting a little royal person. Do you care? Are you following this? 
>> Listen, that girl better hope that the kid doesn't have her father-in-law's ears or she should get hooked up to the epidural tomorrow. That's going to be a tough -- that's going to be a rough rafting trip there. In england they ce down the other side of the fallopian tube. I don't get the royal thing and richard burrton is stunning in this thing. 
>> Peter o'toole plays richard ii and such a creep you wonder how they ever pulled off this whole royalty thing. They're just people like us. They have somebody else put their pants on one leg at a time for them. And they're just like us. N't know how they get by with all of this stuff. Look, there's gallagher, why is gallagher on the screen? 
>> We're going to start with the watermelon. 
>> That's not gallagher, that's the queen. 
>> It's like giving birth to a pineapple with two direct tv satellite dishes connected to it. 

[00:40:47]


>> That's cruel, man. A pineapple? 
(Laughter) 
>> wre lucky to have him here in the l.A. Studio and traveled down by lo from his palatial house in santa barbara. 
>> A limo? We're on fox, they sent half a smart car. I drove myself. 
>> Bill: Gas is $5 a gallon. 
>> And I've got you a welcome to l.A. Gift. 
>> Bill: That's nice, for me. 
>> All right. Don't worry about it. 
>> A little something. 
>> Bill: Oh. I was wanting to read this "killing lincoln". 
>> Bill: I've been wanting to read this. 
>> I'll sign it for you. 
(Laughter) 
>> are you mocking me? My contract that's not allowed. 
>> And I'm hawking for you. 
>> Bill: I know. Gas prices going through the roof, and you say? 
>> Well, first off, whenever i think of you know, the cost of gas, I have to say it's not like my biggest thing. 
>> But you're a rich guy. 
>> And I remember I take a two ton object, move it 30 miles for you know, that point it's two bucks and now it's four bucks and it's not the worst deal you could get. 
>> Who owns this country physically, the land, indians? 
>> No, we do. 
>> The indians are incorporated in that-- 
>> we the people own the land and we own 12 miles of ocean off shore, that's the u.S. Sphere. And we own that, it's ours, all the 320 million american citizens. The government doesn't own it, the oil companies don't own it, so, they take the stuff out of our land and they send it to china. Does that make sense to you? 
>> And other than saying that on this show if you want to get in the way of that process. And take a lot of flak. 

[00:42:48]


>> Just like taxes want to be the first guy to say I'm not paying my taxes. 
>> Bill: Be next to wesley snipes and tough to be in a cell with wesley he turned into a vampire. 
>> And that's where vampires congregate. 
>> And here is wesley snipes. No one saw the movie, but if they do. 
>> Only 56 people who saw that. 
>> That's right. 
>> And all of them were vampires. 
>> HAVE YOU BEEN to McDonald's lately? 
>> I'm not laughing, damn it, I'm not laughing! And damn it, don't you laugh 'cause they're killing you with your taste buds. You don't understand, but you'll hate me for exposing them today! There's a slime in the burger. It's got silicone, they practice how to deceive your taste buds and your nose. 
>> Bill: I like the satan special, please, large fry, big mac. 
>> You know what's worse than that, billy? Guess whowns burger king stock. 
>> Not personal with me. 
>> Louis farrakhan. 
>> That's right, is it just McDONALD'S SATAN IS HANGING Out behind the counter or fast food joints. 
>> One man's slime is another person's roughage. 
>> Bill: I hate to explain farrakhan because I've got enough trouble explaining you. I think he's talking about the fast food, high fat, obesity, all of that, I think that's what he's talking about. 
>> Well, it all comes back to the white man trying to kill the black man, sometimes a burger is just a burger, you know what I mean? And the rev calls everybody, it's always the pot calling the kettle white, you know, with the reverend. . 
>> Monday night I tune into see miller on hawaii 5-0, but unfortunately I tuned in three minutes after ten o'clock eastern time and miller was already dead. Roll the tape. 

[00:44:59]


>> Yeah. 
>> Isn't that occupy moving driving me crazy when I go by. What I'm saying, it's over, time to take the phony, get these kids out of there. I'm sorry, blow your minds little silver surfer, guess what the time in history where your mind deserves to be blown. 
>> Bill: Oh, who killed you, miller? 
>> That was written by a young staff writer named louis farrakhan. 
>> I'm not laughing, damn it, I'm not laughing! 
>> So miller is dead and then james kahn, scott, the other guy solves the crime. Did you go to heaven or helling on that program, by the way? 
>> Billy, I wasn't watching the whole program I was tryg to keep current. 
>> Bill: You didn't see the whole thing? 
>> I s myself, I gotlown up. Why are you going to watch the rest of it. 
>> Bill: Don't you want to know if it's justice done by the bad guy. 
>> I'm hanging on that. 
>> Something really enticing. 
>> And jimmy kahn in the parking lot. Are you on this show? He said this is for my kid, not for my career. 
(Laughter) 
>> hey, what are you going to do? 
>> Coming up, the sage of southern califa sounds off the bacon sundae. 
>> Somebody finally gets it, nothing to top off a sweltering mid august hot day. 
>> Bill: And rapper snoop dogg, miller is next. ???????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????? ???????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????? 

[00:49:31]


>> in miller time. Taking on topics, beginning with san francisco. By the way, have you ever had a street named after new santa barbara, your adopted town or pittsburgh where you grew up? Anybody name a street after you? 
>> I was a bit of a dead end, so maybe a cul-de-sac for a while. Listen, I heard a story, a clueless lane over there and turned it over to pelosi, i have not seen the street, but I will tell you this, it must be heavily, heavily, heavily paved, okay? 
>> Well, look. 
>> You know something? If ethical behavior is a straight line they should have given pelosi lumbar street. 
>> Here is the deal about nancy pelosi drive in san francisco, number one, no right-hand turns got to turn left on the street. 
>> Makes sense. 
>> Bill: All right, number two, it's one way, only one way. And there's no give and take to it. And number three, there's a lot of homeless people have now arrived to live on the street because of the entitlements that come along with nancy pelosi. 
>> I tell what you, billy, the first night I get up there, and I'm going to spray paint an l on there so it reads nancy pelosi drivel. 
>> Bill: And you'll be arrested. Alcatraz, paddling out there. 
>> This is not combat, it's an act of lunacy. 
>> Burger king, they have a new item on the menu and mayor bloomberg was the first one in line for this. It's a bacon sundae. It's a dessert with bacon on it. 
>> Finally, somebody finally gets it, that there's nothing to top off a sweltering hot mid august day like a crispy fried hog fat. How long has this been in the offing? You know what, billy? Like the muslim world needs another reason t hate us, okay? Now, bacon, we can't even have dessert any more without offending al-qaeda. 

[00:51:36]


(Laughter) I've got an idea for a summer treat for the people of manhattan, it's called a bloomberger. It's half the size, twice the price and obviously, you get a really small drink with it. How about we sell that? 
(Laughter) all right, bacon sundaes everybody. 
>> Ooh. And in snoop dogg busted for pot. Shocked, I know we're all shocked, the same place willy nelson got busted. 
>> I don't have a huge tolerance for it. 
>> Probably not a good stretch of road down there. Border patrol popping snoop, you say? 
>> I say it's straight that piece of road, but looks like square because of the drivers, this is munchie-ville, usa. And first time they could have busted anybody sce willie, the fumes like batman and little boy, that only cleared last week. And snoopy came through on the first time they could have isolated him as getting high. 
>> And really. 
>> Listen, I think the judge down there ought to take snoop, willie, george michael from wham, and one of the kids from jamaica, have a smokeoff to raise money for charity. 
>> Bill: Like a chili cookoff. The smokeoff, like-- 
>> the chili cookoff with cannibus, you're right. 
>> Do you want some chili? 
>> More from the d-man coming up. ???????????? dad! I'm here to unleash my inner cowboy... Instead I got heartburn. 
[ horse neighs ] HOLD UP PARTNER. PRILOSEC Isn't for fast relief. TRY Alka-Seltzer. Kills heartburn fast. Yeehaw! 

[00:55:24]


>> Thanks for staying with us, I'm bill o'reilly. In the next miller segment, the d-man added a little extra flare. The best of miller block you don't want to miss. 
>> Forbes released its list of top overexposed celebrities and you want to talk about three of them, go. 
>> Well, listen, I saw the usual suspects, it's the kardashian and the jersey shore kids. I would say this, in lieu of otional intellectual or spiritual heft which is what it used to take to become an immortal, we use redundancy and imprint them like a famed strobe light or something. And at this time in history, what piques our interest as a culture is uninteresting people. It's just that simple. The emptyiest vessels are the ones you can empty your dreams and aspirations into and when these kids sit at home and everybody wants to be famous like warhol said and look to see if you're talented. I can't do that. And when they see snooki on mt. Rushmore, I'm going to watch snooki, you can you be snooki. 
>> Bill: Very perceptive, miller. Like I can do this and watch how she does it and maybe I'll get my own show. 
>> I'm not trashy, unless i drink too much. 
>> Bill: New york city desperate for money as everybody is, municipalities all over, they're going to tax yoga. Going to tax yoga. 
>> Yeah. Pretty soon oomberg is going to come in with a ruler and measure the plumber's crack, the fat guy in front of me and hit him with an exposure to the rest of the class. And you need it with the downward dog. They're like aliens, remember bill packston looking at that scanner, stop your grinning and drop your linen. 
>> They want everything and they're going to keep taxing, and keep taxing, watch it because they'll eventually croak the host organism and there will be nothing to suck off. 

[00:57:32]


>> Bill: Crazy, if you go by the yoga class you have to pay the city a tax. The taxman as the beatles once sang ?????? yeah, I'm the tax man ?????? 
>> al-jazeera, you know the al-jazeera network I'm sure you have it on your cable. 
>> Yeah, right next to the al jiroux network. ???????????? 
>> I love that song. Okay, now, they say al-jazeera said that the usa's torturing terror suspect by playing them sesame street. Lyrics talks about the words and numbers, but these songs were used for inhumane purposes. ?????? Come and play, everything is a-okay ?????? 
>> in 2003, and u.S. Intelligence services tortured detainees with sesame street music for days. 
(Laughter) 
>> I'll tell you anything you want to know, just stop it. Go ahead. 
>> Well, listen, there's a lot the intricacies through this story, I don't know the wheres and why's, if they're using music from pbc, bill moyer is getting a piece of it somewhere down the road. 
>> Listen, I think it helps kids, it keeps them alive to learn how to spell. If they cookie board one of these and he raps the song of the grouch out, it's good for kids, keeps him alive and sick of them whining they're tortured by cute songs like sesame streak and the enters sandman by metallica. These are good songs, have you ever turned on the al-jazeera radio in your market? That's crap music, this is good music-- 
>> sugar sugar by the archie's. That would be out of control. But sesame street. 
>> Then you've got problems. But sesame street is catchy and leads you into indian lake and from there you're-- 

[00:59:38]


>> ????????????

=======================================================

Is traditional america gone for good? That is the subject of this evening's talking points memo. 
>> We will bring you some the most provocative talking points of the year. Including our exclusive analysis of the war on christmas. The secular progress sifs and elites have sought to diminish religion in the public square. 
>> Bill: Plus, how has america changed after this year's election? 
>> Bill: I believe traditional america can come back but it will take a very special person to make that happen. 
>> Bill: Laura ingraham, juan williams, mary katharine ham and lou dobbs will all weigh in. 
>> It doesn't matter if you are a socialist or capitalist. We are talking about government subsidizing and incentivizing behavior. 
>> A special talking points edition of the factor right now. 
>> You have to fill in the blank. I just listed 8 things. What did they vote for? Caution, you are about to enter the no spin zone the factor begins right now. 
>> Bill: Hi, I'm bill o'reilly. Thanks for watching us tonight for this very special talking points edition o the factor. We begin with the war on christmas, the big picture. Whenever the far left viciously attacks you know you are on to ssmght every year when we report secular progressive assaults on the traditions of christmas, the crazy left loons gain I have the tri ole lick campaign to diminish me and this program. There is a reason why they are doing that and it has nothing to do with santa claus. Let's take it step-by-step. No one tells you a person could possibly see a secular display of christmas as imposition of religion. When the rockefeller center christmas tree was lighted last night, no one threw themselves to the ground screaming about jesus. That did not happen. New york city police did not round up the onlookers and force them into saint patrick's cathedral a block away. Nothing religious happened at the tree lighting, it was just a fun occasion. Also you heard an atheist on this program say the federal holiday of christmas imposes religion on him. What religion would that be? He says christianity but christianity is not an organized religion, a church that can be imposed. There are many different churches that promote the philosophy in different ways. Does the atheists think the program government is promotin mormonism. Luted rannism, catholicism, what? The crazy left web site people have emecialgdz. These people are so stupid it's painful. Christianity is a philosophy. You don't have to believe jesus is god in order to admire his view on life. Millions of muslims admire jesus as a prophet. In fact, the united states was founded on judeo-christian philosophy. That's what shaped our constitutionalct tenets. Again, if yous are stone cold dumb and don't understand the difference between an organized church and philosophy, I cannot help you. In 1927, president calvin coolidge made my point when he he sent this christmas message to the american people. 

[00:03:21]


Quote: Christmas is not a time or a season but a state of mind. To cherish peace and goodwill to be plentyyour in mercy. If we think on these things there will be born in us a savior and over w us willhine a star sending its gleam of hope to the world, unquote. That's from my private collection, by the wayo . Is calvin coolidge promoting religion in that christmas greeting? Of course not. He is promoting a mind set of goodwill now, the more intelligent far left people realize what I'm telling is you an absolutely correct historically and theologically. Many of them don't care. They want any hint of spirit out oof the public square. Earlier this week rhode island governor lincoln chief was asked by a reporter exactly why he will will not call the state christmas stree tree a christmas tree. Designed howd some people like you have negated your traditions. 
>> Absolutely right. Gay marriage or accepting immigrants. You areti absolutely right they don't want to believe this is is time to change it. 
>> Bill: Ah-ha. Times are changing are they? The governor told you the b truth. He he is tying the situation into secular progressive politics. Mr. Chief wants to ignore tradition of america and build a more inclusive nation where judeo-christian philosophy is tamped down. That's the big picture here that's the big picture, that's what it is all about. Secular progressives want a new america. Traditional christmas isn't a part of it. That's the mental mow. Now for thef top story tonight. We were able to talk with governor chaf and I admire him for coming on because he knows, he knows that I'm pretty fed up with his point of view. So governor, a holiday tree? Really governor? What's the tradition of a holiday tree? Where does the holiday tree come from? O 

[00:05:28]


>> last yeared when subject came up about what we're going to do this time of year I said just do what the previous governor did. We're not going to change anything. That's what we did. Somehow this has all erupted into some kind of controversy. 
>> Bill: Do you know the traditions of the tree and why it is used around the christmas season? Do you know where that came from? 
>> I have heard all the different scenarios. Some sayt it's something to do with paganism. The mains thing it's a happy time of year. 
>> Bill: All right. I'm happy, your happy. 
>> Having it at my house i have a christmas tree. It's a happy time in my house and it should be here. We also have to be conscious of changing times. 
>> Bill: We will get to the changing times things in a moment. The christmas tree first came from germany. They decorated it for the children then it mored into santa claus and gifts under the tree. 
>> You are going to lecture me now on traditions. 
>> Bill: Wait wait wait. 
>> Go ahead. Tell me a story. 
>> Bill: There is a tradition to itn, that supersedes the governors of rhode island with all due respect. Ere is a tradition to the christmas tree, all right? It's there in context. So guys like you come in and previous governors in other places. You know what? We don't want the christmas tree tradition anymore. That's what tees people off. You want people happy? They are not happy with you, governor. 
>> Did you have to go to public school and say the lord's prayer io n public school. We had to. I did. And get. This first we had to say pledge of allegiance which is good then all of us had to say the lord's prayer. Our father, which art in heaven, hallowed be thy name. Then the supreme court ruled that shouldn't be. Not all students have to say a christian prayer. It was outrage. Now you look back on it and you think ofik course you can't ask non-christians to say a christian prayer in public school. So these controversies you generated them here but they really shouldn't be controversies. This is a public building paid for by everybody of. 

[00:07:42]


>> Bill: Not at all. 
>> It's changing times. 
>> Bill: It's not a symbol of religion are. 
>> Thisbo is secular building. This is is a public building paid for by people of all religions. 
>> Bill: Governor, the lord's prayer is obviously a religious expression. A christmas tree. 
>> It used to be said. I used to have to say it. Everybody used to havee to say in elementary school. Public school. Times change. 
>> Bill: You are making invalid comparison. 
>> Very valid. 
>> Bill: Doesn't make any sense. 
>> This is a public building paid for by people of all religions. 
>> Look, the white house has a christmas tree, okay? What's the difference? The white house has a christmas tree. 
>> You are wrong, bill. They call it a white house tree. 
>> Bill: No, it's a christmas i tree. Barack obama calls it a christmas tree. He is your guy. He calls it a christmas tree. >> well, times are changing and here in this building, a previous governors, north only me. I just said continue what the previous governor has done and that's what I did. You like to make a lot of controversy, so all I can say is. 
>> Bill: Governor, you are the guy making the controversy. All I want to do is keeping the traditions of christmas that make most americans happy. The polls show 90% of americans celebrate christmas and they want to call it a christmas tree. You are in the minority. You are imposing your will. And you are making people unhappy in the season of joy. That's not right. You are not doing the right thing, governor. 
>> I don't make anybody happy. 
>> Bill: I know. You are not making anybody happy. Everybody is unhappy with you. All right in the a atheists want you to burn the holiday tree. 
>> Merry christmas. 
>> Bill: They want to just burn it. You know I'm right in your heart you have know I'm right. 
>> Merry christmas. 
>> Bill: All right, governor. Thanks for taking the heat. We appreciate you coming on. 
>> Have a good day. 
>> Bill: By the way, the governor gave the good people of rhode island exactly 30 minutes to attendex the tree lighting ceremony. Why the short notice? He didn't want protesters? Next on the run down, ms. Laura ingraham will weigh in on the tensions between traditional christians and those who want to radically change the country. coughequence?????? #8. baby.

>> Bill: Continuing with lead story. Joining us from washington is laur a ingraham. Governor chafee looked a little unsteady in that interview especially when he denied that the white house was calling it a christmas tree and obviously they do. I don't think the governor is a badvi man. Do you have any idea what's going on inside his head? 

[00:12:08]


>> The c who stole christmas, complete bill with a drive by tree-lighting ceremony. I have never heard of a drive by tree lighting ceremony before. That is one of theit funniest things I have heard yet. I mean, this is supposed to be a time where the entire community in providence can get together. All supposed to come together and have a moment, right? Chafee has to russia deal through because he knows that even the people of rhode island maybe with the exception of brown think this is ridiculous. Right? But this has been going on,bill, for about five decades now. Because traditional christianity and the churches for the most part have been resisting the great, you know, sexual revolution, the free love stuff and everything that came along with it the secular progressives and elites, very powerful. They have sought mostly through using the courts to diminish traditional religion in the public square. That means a diminent of firsint amendment rights in the publicth scare. Then it trickles down to silly things like charlie brown christmas pageant that a little rock school. Let me stop you for a moment alleged explain that the christmas tree lighting in providence, rhode island is a big deal. Everybody knows that and they can bring their children. Spokesperson said there wasn't going to be a any lighting at all. The people in rhode island went in an uproar. There had to be a lighting. We will sneak it in so nobody knows about it. 
>> Notice what hin this rview with you. He he did what most on the left do in a conversation like this. Rather than debating the facts and the merit and the constitution. Instead fall back onio you need to getac happy and evolve and get with the program. The fact of the matter is there are millions of americans across this country though ho celebrate christmas. This is is a tradition that is grounded in our history. That our family former mts have acknowledged and celebrated with the people. It doesn't mean there is a national religion and people have to believe in jesus christ. He doesn't want to talk about j that he wants to talk about how times have changed and bally everybody who doesn't agree with him has to get with the program. Call it y a holiday tree and then in these instances where prayer in school a moment of silence, you have to go along with that too because a bunch of liberal judges whether end up forcing that down the people's throat. That's why mitt romney should have talked about judges in this lexington election cycle. The action is in the courts. Conservatives are losing oftentimes in the courts we are losing the presidential election. 

[00:14:45]


>> Bill: You are a converted -- laura converted to catholicism. 
>> Yes. 
>> Bill: I'm sure in the beginning when you were thinking about doing it you were attract to the philosophy of jesus and how it was incorporated into the roman catholic church. There wasn't any roman catholic church when jesus was walking or when he was executed. That came afterward. And a considerable amount of time afterward.The philosophy of a jesus attracts people and thenf they look around. Do I wanted to be an episcopalian? I do want to be a baptist? I do want to go and be a catholic? We pick the church. If the government were to say hey you know what we will put that up roman catholickening prochedz providence, rhode island, then they would be right. 
>> It's about more than that this is about a desire on the part of not just the atheists of america. This is a very powerful grouch elites who arey uncomfortable and very hostile to conservative christianity. It's mostly that conservative christians. M 
>> Bill: Saw that when he conflated the thing to illegal immigration and gay marriage. He exposed himself on that. 
>> It's marriage and abortion those two issues are really at the core of the hostility. The push back about what started in the 60's as free love generation to everything else that followed and every debate we have had. Contraceptive debate. Government mandated abortions down the road it all goes back to that world view. They don't like the conservative christian world view they seek to use the government to suppress it. 
>> Bill: Directly ahead, dennis miller says traditional america has vanished. Vaporized by the presidential vote. But is that true? My talking points memo is next. So why treat it like it's a little cold? There's something that works differently than over-the-counter remedies. Prescription TAMIFLU attacks the flu virus at its source. So don't wait. Call your doctor right away. TAMIFLU is prescription medicine for treating the flu in adults and children one year and older whose flu symptoms started within the last two days. Before taking TAMIFLU tell your doctor if you're pregnant, nursing. have serious health conditions, or take other medicines. If you develop an allergic reaction, a severe rash, or signs of unusual behavior, stop taking TAMIFLU and call your doctor immediately. Children and adolescents in particular may be at an increased risk of seizures, confusion or abnormal behavior. The most common side effects are mild to moderate nausea and vomiting. The flu comes on fast, so ask your doctor about TAMIFLU. Prescription for flu. is work. And his new boss told him two things -- cook what you love, and save your money. Joe doesn't knowt yet, but he'll work his way up from busser to waiter to chef before openg a restaurant specializing in fish and game from the great northwest. He'll start investing early, he'll find some good people to help guide him, and he'll set money aside from his first day of work to his last, which isn't rocket science. It's just common sense. From td ameritrade. 

[00:19:15]


>> Bill: Is traditional america gone for good good? That is the subject of this evening's talking points memo. My pal dennis miller believes traditional america has been vaporized that it is gone for good. 
>> Do I think it will ever g back to my lifetime in the other way no, I don't. I think this is it. Do I think it's the mercury saw from 18 to 58? No, I don't. Is that the end of the world , no it's not like I was in the shower this morning and find a lump in my armpit. That's always my fall back position. I have got a great life. But I'm just saying it is not the mercury have grown comfortable with. 
>> Bill: I have given miller's election take a lot of thought. And I disagree with him. I believe traditional america can come back but it will take a very special person to make that happen. Let's look at what happened. President obama received about 62 million votes. 11% less than he got in 2008. So he is slipping in popularity. Mitt romney endedo up wit 3.3 million fewer votes than thett president, close, but romney got 2% fewer votes than johnne mccain garnered in 2008. By any poor performance. Mccain was running right into a recession. It was more about romney's failure to build on mccain's vote than obama doing anything. Are stronger candidate would have defeated theb president. Mr. Obama won the woman vote. Blacks and asians. It was the hispanic vote that really nailed romney. 71% of latinos voted for the president. That was a difference in florida, virginia, colorado, and nevada. Other states were impacted as well.Ol romney took white males and independents by significant margins. When you punch it all up together. When you bunch it up, it was anhe entitlement vote this year. American families earning less than $30,000 a year broke big for the president. 62% to 35. So it's clear that left wing ideology did not win the day for barack obama. Big spending on federal programs did. That's the key. Because many in the media would have us believe liberal ideology was confirmedve by this election. It was not.Ol however, however. Secularism is certainly eroding traditional power. No question about it. Those americans who attend religious services at least once a week voted for romney 59 to 39. The problem is church-going is is on the decline in this country. Here is an example. Despite the president's controversial insistence that some catholic entities provide birth control and after pills, catholics supported obama 50% to 48%. Down from 2008 but still a surprise to some. But only only about 30% of american catholics now attend weekly mass. So you can see the impact of creeping secularism on the religious vote. On paper, the stats look hopeless for traditional americans. But they can be reversed. However, it will take a very special politician to do that. By the way, mitt romney didn't even try to marginalize secularism. He basically ignored it it a mistake because president obama is the poster guy for the secular progressive movement. The key get question going forward is the s.P. Movement good for americans no matter what their ethnicity. The answer is no. Three vivid examples. Secular progressives champion a do-your-own thing philosophy. No judgments about personal behavior are allowed in that arena. The public school system has adopted that philosophy. That's now wreaking havoc on american society. In 2010, about 41% of american babies were born out of wedlock. That's up 8 percentage points since 2000. And up an astounding 23 percentage points since 1980. Babies born to unmarried women drive poverty every study shows that and american minority groups are the most affected. Inin 2010, 73% of black babies were born, outside of marriage. 53 of hispanic babies were. The number was 29% for white babies. So the cycle continues. Minorities are more affected by poverty because the traditional family unit has broken down in those precincts. And rather than trying to reverse that, secular progressives want more entitlement spending. Nothing about changing libertine, attitudes. On the abortion front, same thing, rather than trying to trying to discourage taking the lives of millions of fetuses, the s.P.'S have created a mythical war on women. Screaming that so-called reproductive rights are under assault. The abortion zealots wants the procedure on demand. No matter how late term. Are stridently opposed to even counseling before this life-ending procedure is undertaken. Abortion is settled law in the u.S.A. But it should be discouraged because human d.N.A.Ke is present uponed conception. Thus, the situation becomes a human rights issue. Ask yourself this question. Should america be a country where potential human life, undeniable fact after conception is terminated for convenience, for convenience? Is that the kind of country we want? And the federal government is going to demand that citizens who oppose abortion pay for it? What sayen you planned parenthood? Finally, twowh states, washington and colorado, voted to legalize pot. The grim stats on this idiocy. Since 2008, teenage pot use up 48%. Heavy use for teens has increased 80%. States that have lenient medical marijuana laws driving those stats. Why? Because legalizing pot sentsdz a message that it's fine to use it. And getting the drug at the corner pot f shop makes it readily available to anyone. Ask any drug counselor, and he or she will tell you once a child is introduced to intoxication can't that child's life changes for the worse. Some may not become substance-involved but millions will. Do we want to encourage that? The s.P.'S. They don't care about addiction. They don't want limitations on so-called private behavior. No judgments. Want to smoke drugs? Fine. Want to abort aat fetus? We'll drive you to the clinic. Want to have a kid when you are 16? No problem a all. We'll support you. If mitt romney spelled that out, what secular progressive movementmn is really all about? Strong vivid terms and how president obama enables that, romney would not have lost 71% of the hispanic vote, I can tell you. I believe the majority of americans can be persuaded. But the far left is a dangerous outfit. Bent on destroying traditional america and replacing it with a social free fire zone that drives dependency and poverty. We the people need to be confronted with the reality of our situation. But so many of our politicians are cowardly that the truth is rarely heard. Well, tonight you heard it. And maybe four years from now, what's really at stake in america will finally be heard loud and clear. That's the memo. Next on the run down, juan and mary katharine will react and the factor will be right back. ??????

Joining us now from austin, texas, marianne catherine ham and juan williams both are fox news analysts. Am I right here? Wrong here where am i. 
>> You are a little off target. 
>> I'm off target. 
>> Just a little bit. Some of the thingshi I resonate with. There are lots of older americans right now who say this is not the mercury grew up in. Nobody is speaking I english. I go to the 7/11. Who are these people and they get angry and they say america has changed. You can't demonize the new folks in america and make them out to be america's problem just because and say well, you know, these folks didn't vote for romney. In fact, people said romney shares their values. This is across the board. But they said obama in a cares about people like me. And what you have got to do here. 

[00:29:45]


>> Bill: I don't think 71% of hispanics are secular progressives. Would you agree with that? 
>> No. That'ss, what I was coming to you next to say to you when you look at catholics, hispanics strongly catholics. 
>> Romney couldn't put it in vivid terms so ty would respond to that. 
>> No. 
>> Bill: All right, mary katharine you say. 
>> I think you are on target on a bunch of this. We have I reached a turning point of sorts. That doesn't mean that folks who believe whatd romney believes or belve in general to the right of center as juan was pointing out many people still do that that can't result in electoral victory in the future. I think you are correct that it takes a special person. I think it took a special person in barack obama to bring theta left to where it is right now. I'm frankly surprised it got here. And it will takeba somebody who really connects with people who is charismatic and smart and takes this message to people in a smart way where you are not demonizing anybody and I reject the notion that i or I or bill or anyone else is doing that in explicit ways. You have to cross these cultural barriers and talk in a way that'smart and reach folks. That was part of what was missing. 
>> Bill: Talk in a way that challenges them. I mean, look, as you said most hispanic americans are catholic. They are family oriented. 
>> Strongly. 
>> Bill: Very veryon tradition in hispanic precincts, family, family, family. Yet, they rejected all of that. 
>> No, no. Why do you think that? 
>> Bill: Because if you looked at the democratic convention and you saw allhe abortion zealots and allk the zealot tri up there and the dependency and the big government programs, you couldn't possibly say this is the pro-family party, the democrats. 
>> Of course you could. You saw the mayor san antonio his mother and his wife. 
>> Bill: If you want to parade kids you can't beat romney he has 42 of them. 
[ Laughter ] 
>> Bill: I'm saying the message that was put forth by planned parenthood now and that real was an antifamil message. 

[00:31:47]


>> That's not true. 
>> Wait a minute. Wait a minute. 
>> Bill: Abortion on demand for an wy reason at any time. 
>> They all say that. 
>> Bill: Yes they did. 
>> What they said was you shouldn't get into things like requiring invasive procedures before a woman is allowed to have anes abortion. 
>> Bill: Evasive? 
>> In this election more thanan half of americans said abortions should be legal. Then let's come to something like marijuana. A minute you said you let that. What do you say about alcohol, bill o'reilly? 
>> Bill: I don't make those comparisons. 
>> Bill, you don't even drink. 
>> Bill: I don'take thosel, comparisons because they are not constructive. 
>> Have you gone to college and seen these frat boys out there having a bigeer bash? 
>> Bill: Do you know what juan is doing now. Word of the day do you know what he is doing? Is he pettifogging the marijuana issue. 
>> There we go and I'm a lawyer. 
>> Bill: Introducing an alcohol discussion that has nothing to do. Exactly what you did. You petty fogged the issue by introducing alcohol when the stats are 40% of teens are up in marijuana and 80% ineavy use. 
>> What? 
>> Heavy marijuana use. 
>> What about alcohol will? 
>> Bill: No, but you h ignore those stats by introducing another topic, alcohol. 
>> Bill: That's -- you and calvin coolidgeis back to 1930, what you did was pettifogging. You avoided the fact by introducing something else that we're not talking about. Mary katharine,in okay. Have you had yours. 
>> My drink. 
>> Let m take us back to the family stuff real quickly. First of all, conservatives need to understand this is something that I have talked about for a while that we can't waitt for people to get married to become conservative. We can't waiteo for people because they are church go everies tove be conservative. It takes a little bit more convincing than it used to because people's lifestyles used to drive them towards this philosophy. We have to do more convincing. But here is the other thing. I think you are right, bill, there is so many unintended consequences of this giant clumsy and corrupt federal government to solve every problem that often you end up with single motherhood and parenthoodft driving 40% of income inequality. Which is not what the result of the left wants but it is what it ends up t with. You start to try solving that with more subsidies. It's not a a healthy way to solve that problem. Not a flexible smart way to solve that problem. Conservatives have a different method where you can take things to the states where even in states like poll policy which I may differ with you on can become experiment mental democracy. People keep voting for every bigger federal government have you none of those p opportunities and you lose the opportunity to help people. 

[00:34:23]


>> Bill: Governmental I just want to say to you and to mary catherine that you can't say to these people like you're cranky and angry over the election. You guys are a bunch of lay a abouts, you are having children out of wedlock. You are smoking pot. 
>> Who said that? 
>> Let me tell you something, people share values, a family and love of country. 
>> Said the exact opposite of those things. 
>> Bill: From what I took away from juan was you can still be stoned and lovero your country. Very good, juan, thank you.

[00:37:08]


>> the talking points memo he this evening. All of us, allus needs to wise up and fast. You may have h the story of new york city police officer lawrence deprimo who spent $100 of his own money to give a homeless man some boots. That man was lying in the street when the officer spotted him. 
>> It was extremely cold that night. And you know you see this gentleman, I tried to offer him to buy him a pair of socks. And he said no, officer, but god bless you. Thank you for asking. And when I seen something like that, you know, here it is,'swh freezing cold out and he has the heart to god bless me. I just knew I had to help him. 
>> Bill: Obviously officer deprimo is the patriot. Here is the sad truth. Mr. Hillman is not homeless. He has an apartment. Paid for by you and me. Is he on government assistance. He has enough resources to live his life in a dignified manner. Yet, mr. Hillman doesn't do that he prefers the street. And the boots officer deprimo gave him have disappeared. Now, I'm not judging hillman. Most cases like his involve substae abuse or mental illness. However, we must be honest. The government cannot provide a decent life for hillman. No matter how much money it spends. We're already giving the guy tens of thousands of dollars a year and it is doing nothing. There are millions of americans like jeffrey hillman and we all need to understand thater some people simply will not, will not save themselves. This translates into an issue that effects all of us. Right now,ue an estimated 66 million americans are receiving food stamps and/or medicaid.Me in addition, there are 21 million folks working for the government. That means that 87 million people in america are being subsidized by we the tax pairs. But there are only 109 million americans workerring in the private sector, doing the math, it's impossible for 109 million workers to support 87 million people. It can't be done. No matter how much you tax the workers. Yet, the obama administration and the democratic party continue to put forth that higher taxation will bring the massive government debt under control. Perhaps the only democrat telling the truth will this is our old pal howard dean the uber liberal former governor of vermont. Th truth is everyone needs to pay more taxes not just the rich. That's a good start. We are not going to get out of this deficit problem unless we raise taxes across the board. 

[00:39:51]


>> Bill: Governor dean sympathizes with the socialist philosophy and that's where the country is heading. Taking from those that are productive and giving to those who are struggling or who are working for the massive government apparatus. During this christmas season i think we all should emulate officer did he prim mow. We should all help those in need that help may be futile. If the federal government doesn't wise up and impose some discipline on the incredible entitlement spending, america's economy will eventually collapse. President obama needs to invite jeffrey hillman to the white house. He needs to talk to the man with no shoes. He needs to see what is exact happening in this country got to get real about government spending. This is incredible the pennsylvania department of public healthcare says that a single mother with two children is better off taking a job that pays $29,000 a year than a job that pays $69,000 a year. Why? Because of entitlements. Joining us from our fox anchor stewio lou dobbs. Explain this for us, please. 
>> We have got to give great credit to the public pennsylvania. I know then federal government as do you would listen. Think abouigt these benefits being receiveded by this woman. 25,000 and take home salary of $57,000, you add to that go through whether it's child care or whether it is transportation. Two children in pennsylvania. Foot stamps amounts to a subsidy of $6,300 a year to that family of three. Medicare and child health insurance. 16,500 a year. Section 8 subsidized, low income rent. Another 4300. S earned income tax credits. Modestly $5,000. They could rismoe significantly beyond that but at any rate. They would total so much money, combined with the -- national school lunch m program,the needy family assistance programs, we're talking about more take home pay, disposable income for that woman with her two children on public assistance than a woman with two children earning $57,000 a year. It's extraordinary. 

[00:42:35]


>> All right. And if she were earning 69 wouldn't get any of that. 
>> Right. 
>> Bill: The pennsylvania authorities say the system is set up now to reward people not making any money. If you try to bring yourself up and raise yourself up in salary, you are actually going to have a lower standard of living because you lose some of these benefits. That's the game right now. 
>> It's the game. It is also the challenge because they are trying to avoid that collision. Because it doesn't matter, in thison one instance what we are talking about here, if you are a socialist or a capitalist, we are talking about government subsidizing and incentivizing behavior. 
>> Bill: Real quick, did i pick on this jeffrey hillman guy, the homeless guy? This guy has his apartment paid for, he has god medicaid and food stamps. Has he got it all. Am I being unfair to him. 
>> Not at all. Our president who spent much of his life as aommunity organizer is more interested in expanding government than he is in actually organizing and supporting communities which are really the answer to mr. Hillman's tragedy. 
>> Bill: Solving these kinds of problems. 
>> Absolutely. 
>> Bill: Coming up how the new entitlement culture helped decide the election. That's moments away. 
>> Bret: This is a fox news alert. I'm bret baier live in washington as we take a live look at the house floor. This is congressman david drier, is he the chairman of the house rules committee. The house is getting ready to debate what's called the rule, getting ready to put forward the senate bill dealing with the fiscal cliff. There was a back and forth all day today about whether conservatives in the house would let that go forward. But it looks like this will happen. Let's listen in to congressman drier. 
>> Similarly, this notion of approaching a deadline and trying to deal with an issue is something that happens in this institution and this is another example where that's the case. The issues that we are attempting to address tonight with this vote are as important as they are challenging the range of ideas proposed as the solutions are as desperate as are numerous. This body like our nation has been deeply divided over how to proceed. Under these circumstances, an agreement has been extraordinarily allusive. All know that the bill before us is not the grand bargain that I and I think most of my colleagues had hoped that we would have been able to achieve. What we are doing this evening, mr. Speaker is, a very essential bridge to what I hope will be a comprehensive long-term solution bring us back from the edge of the fiscal cliff. I know just hours ago we did technically go over that bridge. We are working hard to pull ourselves back from that cliff we went over the cliff and we are pulling ourselves back. And we are ensuring the taxes are not increased on 99% of americans. I know I'm not alone when i say I had high hopes of package of sweeption tax reform and something that i think has to be acknowledged and I'm very saddened that it's not included in here but entitlement reform. We all know aou know very well, mr. Speaker, that entitlement reform is the only way that we're going to successfully get our arms around this marv 16, now i guess it's $16.25 trillion national debt that is there. As willie sutton said he robbed banks because that's where the money is we know that entitlement reform is going to be essential if he would are going to be able to get our fiscal house in order. I'm saddened that this is not part of it. Passed out of the house of representatives. Meaningful reform in a number of these areas. It's truly unfortunate that our friends in t other body have not engaged thus far in these efforts. But mr. Speaker be, the legislation which is before us which again as we all know passed 2:00 this morning earlier today in the senate will ave the economic crisis and set the stage for the very hard work that must be done in the coming weeks. Now mr. Speaker pro tem you and I won't be here for that work to take place. I know you share my view that our colleagues have a unique opportunity as the 113th congress begins its work on noon on thursday to take on this challenge. Believe have a unique opportunity because of the fact that there is divided government. Because we have the president of one party who regularly talks about the need for this kind of reform and i congratulate him for that. The people's house. The house of constitution has the responsibility of dealing with tax issues this body the other party, mr. Speaker. In light of that, I thinkhat since there is a consensus on the need to tackle these issues, it can be done in a bipartisan way. I hope very much I hope very much happen. The way for us to take that first step is to pass that rule bipartisan support. I appreciate the kind words of the ranking members. Slaughter upstairs and supporting this effort that we have. And en at the end of the day, once we go into the debate on senate amendment which is what this rule will call for us to do which will again have strong bipartisan support for that measure. So with that mr. Speaker at this juncture I will reserve the balance of my time. 

[00:49:09]


>> That's congressman david dreier. He is the chairman of the house rules committee. Is he retiring. Member of congress from california. You can't consider a bill until you have a r the house of representatives. It's essential lie like the parameters for a debate like batting practice before the actual game. The logistics, the parliamentary procedure of the house floor. That's what they are doing right now. Talking about this rule and then they will deal with the bill. The actual bill that came over from the senate. Early this morning passed overwhelmingly in the senate to deal with the fiscal cliff. Joining me on capitol hill our chief congressional correspondent mike. This has been a tense back and forth as republicans have considered all day how to move this forward. They spent a lot of hours behind closed doors trying to figure out the way forward. What we heard from members is essentially they did not like the idea that this senate bill doesn't cut spending. A lot of them feel like they were elected and brought to washington to cut spending, to get a contr on all the government spenting that goes on. And bottom line is is that this bill that the senate hammered out. Senate republican leader mitch mcconnell ham medicine out with the vice president of the united states has $626 billion in new tax revenue but only some $15 billion in spending cuts. And so essentially $41 of new taxes for every dollar of spending cut. And so a lot of the republicans were telling their leaders that they don't like this bill. They think it's a bad deal. They should tack on an amendment spending cuts attached. The bottom line was time is running out. We are less than 48 hours from a new congress being sworn in. They had the clock ticking. They might just say okay fine, it's the house republicans fault for the largest tax increase in america in history. House republican leadership feels like they had a very difficnd that he they were dealt. This deal was passed in the middle of the night by a very big bipartisan vote. So with their backs against the wall with the clock ticking and concerned about how the markets might react tomorrow, they are going forward with this bill because they could not get consensus on one amendment that would cut spending, bret? 

[00:51:33]


>> If they had decided to go forward with amending it, mike it really would have thrown a wrench into the whole system as far as sending the bill back to the senate. A senate that went home for the night already and is not coming back until tomorrow. 
>> Absolutely. Democratic senate leadership aides were essentially sailing that the house republicans had been kept abreast of the negotiations. They were aware of what was going on. It was not a surprise of what was coming. If they try to toy with this bill that passed overwhelmingly with the bipartisan vote in the senate, that they were not going to take it up and that they would pin the blame on the house republicans and so with that in mind it may be better to cut taxes for an overwhelming majority of the american public than will allow a massive tax increase on everybody. At least that seems to be the calculation at this late hour. 
>> Okay. Mike emanuel watching things up on the hill. We will head back for breaking details as there will be many likely in the next few minutes as they get ready to consider this voted on the senate bill. Let's turn now to chief white house correspondent ed henry at the white house. The white house, the president, anxiously watching this all day, ed. Actively democrats on the bill. Behind closed doors just as he did with senate democrats. Certainly you would have to say his efforts last night were successful. Wildly successful because bus it was overwhelming vote in the wee hours of the morning of new year's day to pass it among democrats and republicans. He was lobbying democrats mostly. And let's not forget there were several liberal democrats in tom harkin and others. He ended up voting against but there were many other liberal democrats who said they were uncertain. They thought it was not going far enough in terms of tax cuts for the middle class. And so they lived to fight another day. In the end joe biden brought them along. There is an important point to make about the fact that this whole exercise started as an effort in deficit reduction. As you know, bret, it ends tonight in an exercise in which if this passes through the house and is signed into law by the president. This will add nearly $4 trillion in new debt over the next 10 years. That is not according to me. That is not according to either party. That is according to the nonpartisan congressional budget office. And so this started out as a way to try to reign in debt. And, instead. It's going to add a lot to the debt. That's why there is a lot of conservative frustration about it. That's why speaker boehner has had such a hard time today, he basically let a lot of the conservatives in his caucu vent for several hours. It may have been a short strategy in the short-term because it allows conservatives to express their anger behind closed doors and come out oto the cameras and say they really don't like this deal but at the end of the day it's probably the best thing they can do right now to avoid the possibility of the nation slipping into another recession number one and number two, it locks in tax cuts not for everybody but for a big, big share of this country and so now both parties can claim that they are extending tax cuts for a lot of people that's a better outcome for either party than the republicans looking tonight like they're blocking this deal and then going home and having to answer for the fact that we're not only maybe crashing the markets, slipping into recession but, also, stopping tax cuts for a lot of people. It's not going to be a perfect deal but it's one that in the end it appears and we will see what the vote is. It appears like folks are coming in -- 

[00:55:09]


>> Bret: A lot of people saying appears that republics are going to vote in greater numbers. During the day it appears those votes were not shoring up. We had a number of conference meetings up on the hill. Quick live I want to ask you do we expect if this does pass to hear from the president tonight? 
>> We do expect to hear from the president. The question is whether we will will see him. Will we see him on camera or will it just be a paper statement? If this were to come down tonight, I would say it's a guarantee based on our conversation with some of his aids that he will be out here tonight on camera beating up on the house of representatives as we saw a little bit yesterday which may have back fired on them yesterday, a little bit of a pep rally here. He would be going after the house and trying to communicate directly with the measure people saying put pressure on them. We are running out of time. We have got pass this deal. If it does pass tonight, it might just be a paper statement. We are expecting he is going to get on air force one very quickly. Head back to for the rest of the vacation with his family. If he wins tonight, essentially he may just put out a paper statement and move on or he might come on cam and take one last victory lap and move on. 
>> Bret: Weful cover it either way. Ed, thank you. Chad pergram is our senior producer on capitol hill. He has been covering every angle on this from the very beginning. You had the eric cantor saying he does not support this bill. And that sent shock waives, really through the washington. As he was making this public and blunt statement. Then they had a series of meetings really behind closed doors to get a path forward here. 
>> Yeah. And it was very significant. Some people started to speculate. It was just conjecture that there may be a sism between house speaker john boehner and eric cantor. They seem to be much more on the same page much more in the past year or so. It was interesting that they walked down to the final conference meeting. Eric cantor and john boehner walked down the center steps to the capitol. To the basement of the capitol soldier to soldier symbolic gesture that they were together and on the same page even though they might see this differently. The house speaker often does not vote on basement john boehner was concerned. He had some skepticism about this bill. But his responsibility as the speaker is to lead. And he didn't see too many ways out of this culled sack. He said look if we can get the votes possibly to go through the -- if we can get the votes possibly to amend the bill and send it over to the senate I'm willing to do that. If we can't, we have to take the senate bill. We are running out of time. We just have about 40-some hours left in this congress. We have to finish this by midday on thursday. 

[00:57:50]


>> Bret: I explained to feex little bit about what we are looking at live on the house floor. Congressman david dreier the chairman of the house rules committee and we're in the process of what's called debating the rule. This is the set-up to getting the bill to the floor. Just go through for folks at home very quickly, chad, not in too many of the weeds, how this is going to progress and how this bill could move forward and how quickly or how slow it may go. 
>> Right. We'll just do a high cut here. We won't do this golf course level here. We will keep this pretty high. What happens is almost every piece of legislation has to get a rule. That governs how you handle ton othe house floor. What you are hing right now is a predebate and once you agree to the rule they would have to vote, perhaps, they could do that very quickly, then you get to the actual debate on the piece of legislation itself. You can't bring up a bill to the floor in most circumstances. Unless you get the rule. Because it's kind of like playing baseball each day. One day you might say you have four outs in an inning. One day you have three outs in an inning. One day two balls to get a walk. They create a different set of rules each day on the house floor for how they handle each bill. How many amendments are in order. How much time they are going to debate it that's what they did today. It's not it going to have any amendments. I wonder if we would take that much time to debate. This I'm hearing we could wrap this up in the earliest scenario. Maybe arched 10:00 eastern. In the latest scenario maybe 11 to 11:15 p.M. Eastern. 
>> Bret: Okay. Chad pergram with some so-so news if we have to hang around that long for this vote we will see. We will head back for all the latest. Thank you. Stand by we're watching all the fiscal cliff action on capitol hill. This is is a fox news alert. I'm bret baier live in washington. 
>>> Let's listen in to congressman dryer quickly and then I will bring in the panel tonight.

=======================================================

To fox news to the house floor. Let's listen in. Waiting for the final gavel as the house passes the legislation. To avoid the fiscal cliff. The senate passed the legislation early in the morning. The house has now done the same. Votes are in. And it is completely a lopsided vote. However, you can see republicans are outnumbed in their support by double. 
>> On this vote yeas 257, nays 167. The motion is adopted. Without occasion. 
>> And with that it's official. That the house has moved this piece of legislation. Now we'll got to the president to be signed. Joining me now on capitol hill, chief congressional correspond mike emmanuel. Mike? 
>> Bret, good evening. And it's been quite a day out here on capitol hill in the wee hours of the morning the senate passed this and the question is what would house republicans do? A lot of leadership felt like they had a bad hand this, is passed by a wide margin, the clock running out on the 112th n congress by noon, on thursday there would be a new congress sworn in. I've got to telling talking to democrats and republicans there is a great dissatisfaction, if you will, if you were to poll them about job performance, they'd not feel good about it because they feel like all of the major deals that come up are becoming last minute deals, negotiated by two people, and the congressional committees are not picking up the deals they're not challenging or tackling big challenges of our times. Whether entight element, the debt, you name it. There is grit dissatisfaction here, because here we are on newor's day after the fiscal cliff deadline passed and many republicans in this case feel like they aid gun to accept this deal or be blamed for allowing the country to go off the fiscal cliff, and perhaps a recession. Sits involving two bipartisan gentleman, call this a missed opportunity to do something big but call it a small step forward towards getting a handle on the nation's debt issues. But up here on capitol hill, a lot of people holding their noses and voting in favor of this deal. Realizing they do not want to be blamed for sending the country off the miss cal -- fiscal cliff. 

[00:03:06]


>> Mike, thank you. The final vote 257 to 167. 85 republicans voting yes. 170 democratic yes votes. We can also report that house majority leader voted no. The vice presidential nominee in 2012 voted aye. Speaker boehner also voted i. Mike emmanuel mentioned the chairman of the did he have it and debt commission to deal with this did he have it and debt came out with a detailed statement. I'd like to read it here. Quote, the deal is a missed opportunity to do something big to reduce our long term fiscal problems but it small step forward in our efforts to reduce the federal deficit following on the one trillion dollar did he have it? Spending. Both steps advance efforts to put our fiscal house in order neither done, nor -- one nor combination of the two come close to solving problems and loaders must have the courage to reform our tax code and entitlement program such that we put it on a downward path as a percent of the economy. Washington missed this magic moment to do something big, recuse the deficit, reform our tax code and fiscal entitlement programs we've known over a year this fiscal cliff is coming. Washington politicians set it up. Forcing them selfs to deal with our nation's lng term fiscal problems. After taking the country to the brink of economic disaster, washington still could not forth a consensus. It's now more critical than ever that policy makers return to negotiations building on the terms of the agreement and spending cuts. These negotiations will need to make the far more difficult reforms bringing spending further under control and making our programs sustainable ask reform our tax code to both promote growth and we take some enare kurmt from statements by the president and leaders of congress they recognize more work needs to be done. In order to reach an agreement it will be necessity for both sides to move beyond their comfort zone and reach a principled agreement on a comprehensive plan, putting debt on a clear downward path relative to the economy. Again, allen simpson ander skin bowles, chairs of the deficit and debt commission with a detailed statement after the house passage of the bill that is now on its way to the white house that. Is where we find our chief white house correspondent with breaking news. Ed? 

[00:05:56]


>> Who thinks -- what side thinks they won tonight? The president will be coming out behind me about 11:20 p.M. Eastern time to talk about this deal that is now passed through both houses. You will note, a sharp contrast to the fact that speaker boehner did not come out on the floor and speak in favor of it. Did not urge colleagues publicly to support it z this is because the white house feels they've got the upper hand here, they think the president took the message of raising taxes on the wealthy to the american people in the election. He won reelection. And that now, he has the political capitol to spend to push this through capitol hill. However, in that campaign, you'll note he talked about this being a balance add prech not just raising taxes on the rich but coming up with cuts this, deal as you're noting in that statement is devoid of large spending cuts. It's only got about a net of $15 brinl in spending cuts so. They're going to have to come back for more bites of the apple. Both president and republicans on capitol hill if, in fact they're willing to follow up on that promise in terms of a balanced approach. This bottom line is in terms of drivers we've been talking about and in that statement, medicare, entitlement programs they're not touched in this deal. It will be interesting to see once the president says about the day as head in terms of the debt ceiling fight, other budge yet battles coming up. If we're going cut into this debt, bret. 
>> And there a sense that we just had that detailed statement by simpson bowles. There are pointed sentences about the lack of entitlement reform and lack of dealing with the big picture and problems. Do you sense the president is going to embrace that message? As you get ready up against the debt ceiling? 

[00:07:59]


>> There is an opportunity tonight but importantly to follow up on day as head. We've heard both sides talking about it so long. Lawmakers in both parties saying if only we can be voting now on a big bold plan. And you don't seem to see the plans coming up for votes in the house and senate. There is a chance tonight for the president to talk about his vision for that in the days ahaid. They talked about a big deal. And the latest version had $1.2 trillion in tax increases and $1.2 trillion in spending cuts. The score board sws something different, about $620 kbrinl of tax increases and $15 billion in spending cuts. Going back to a year and a half ago there is is that down grade. Reason why there is a down grade is a lack of political will in this town of washington. For both parties to step up arks dress the big programs that are growing and address the debt problems some of the problems we've seen a cross europe still sweeping across europe to get serious, and bold about the debt problem here in the united states. As you can see they're saying tonight that this is a small step forward. But clearly not the big bold plan that both sides have bee talking about for a long time. 
>> And I'm live in the white house and we'll head back getting closer for his arrival there. Now some reaction, I guess some information from lawmakers in the house. Chris? 
>> So, in talking to bret, lawmakers voting for and against, among the republicans in the house there is no expectations that there will be any spending cuts in entitlements or anything going forward. There is zero expectations that there will be reforms for entitlements or anything out of this, those voting in favor of this passage, passing this legislation were only interested in getting tax rates extended and getting as many people out of the pool as they could, there is no expectation of any real fiscal reform as it relates to these things. And there is real disappointment and frustration among those who vote in order legislation that l tl will not be fiscal reform in this. 

[00:10:37]


>> Chris, you had g.O.P. Leadership split on this vote. You had speaker boehner voting yes. You had paul ryan voting yes. You had eric cantor voting no. Is there a split as charles talking about here on the panel developing inside of the republican party that is being used and possibly taken advantage of by democrats including the white house? 
>> Well, I will say something that is simplest thing to say is that charles is right. And that is a freebie. But it is not right as it relates to or it doesn't apply to not april politicable relating to boehner and cantor this, is a cal clue coup laigs. Inside of the caucus that boehner is the, taking it, he says I brought the deal so I'm going to vote for it. Ryan who is a pragmatist is saying I am the budget committee chairman. Then, they're letting the other guys off the hook. If you look how small number of people is, that is voting in favor, how small the number of republicans voting in favor of this is, they're letting just aut everybody off the hook. They're taking it and they're hoping that as few a number of human beings is watching this as is possible. And that they will let this pass on into the night. That it will be done. And that is what they hope to do. And that is not a split. It's just the reality of getting this done, and limiting tax increase to as few people as possible. 
>> Yes. But if they don't believe there is going to be on the back end, spending cuts or forms. There must be some kind of a split in what is a good idea or bad to vote for this. 

[00:12:37]


>> They know there won't be those kinds of changes in the future. This is a question of boehner kept talking about it over and over again. 99 people drawning people out of the pool. They know that the sense of republican caucus is that president is not serious as it relates to reforms, they're gooding to get out of this as best they can. And are going to be sorry. It's going to be too bad. They all knew that these would not be four, five happy months and that the president is sworn into office again, that they're going to have a difficult time in front of them until mid term, expecting gains in mid terms but knew this is not going to be good. What you can see in this legislation with zero cuts in this is admission recognition that it won't -- it is not going get better, soon. 
>> Okay. Chris thank you. I want to head up to capitol hill. And our senior producer up there. We can see speaker boehner walk by at any moment. Give us color, if you would up there. Chad brks this vote and what's happening now. 
>> This is interesting how subdued they were. Sometimes there is a big roll after plaus. There is some faint applause there but people were mostly struck by is that there is division in voting by leadership. Usually the speaker of the house does not vote. It's just a sort of the way it goes. This john boehner only votes three times each year voted yes for this. And eric cantor said earlier he was opposed, in fact voted no. AS IS kevin McCarthy, the whip. WE asked McCarthy just minutes ago how he could sort of whip against a vote that he was against. He said this wasn't something we're whipping for or against. We're trying to assess earlier in the day where people were to see if we can bring plans forward maybe to try to get cuts here. So... Divisions in the leadership there also something I might point to. Paul ryan, former vice presidential nominee voted yes. I should point out people have said that marco rubio, republican senator from florida, he voted no, very early this morning in the senate. Some people already saying that that is a presidential sweep stake dynamic the between marco rubio and paul ryan. As you look ahead to 2016. 

[00:15:17]


>> What about that split between cantor and boehner sf both camps saying they're standing together despite the fact there is a public statement. Now, the vote against and for what is being said. 
>> Well, people look at that. Again, I think that john boehner and eric cantor have been on the page, same page better in the past few months or year than at one point there. But john boehner looked at this as something he had to do. Sometimes, he said maybe a speaker very to get out there to do this. He had remained neutral, you know? In the republican conference there. I think the other thing to look for here is look at vote breakdown here. So you had 85 democratic yeas. Excuse me, 85 republican yeas. And 172 democratic yeas so well over, you know twice as many voting yes here is significant in a body that is controlled by republicans. So again, this is just one of the unique dynamics and a strange vote this, is in the a typical vote like any stretch of the imagination. 
>> Okay. You can hear other property reporters there in a cramped hallway. We'll wait to see if the speaker walks by and if you get a question, we'll head back. Thank you. Just in is senate minority LEADER mitch McConnell's reaction to this vote. He says, quote, now, it's time to get serious about reducing washington's out of control spending. That is a debate american people want and a debate we'll have next and republicans are ready for. Heading back to the white house, we await any moment, the president into the white house preefg room sets the stage for us there. Clearly, senate, senator McCONNELL IS SETTING UP THE Next battle. And is getting ready he s because it's gg to be all about spending cuts. We've seen tax increases in this deal n addition to cuts. The president said and he said it yesterday that any deficit reduction in the day as head will be about spending cuts as well as tax increases you can SEE senator McConnell played a good role, in getting us to this point in saving it from falling apart is now saying there has to be a lot of spending cuts in day as head. Another quick point is that everyone going to be wondering since paychecks are depending on this, how quickly will the president sign a bill into law? There is stuff that they have to enroll the bill as they say that. Is sometimes taking hours smrks times a day or so. In this case given the situation, we're expecting the president quickly after maing this statement behind me, is going to be getting back aboard fair force one, heading back to hawaii so there is a good chance in the next day or so we may see a piece of legislation boarding a plane going to hawaii so the president can sign it. He may not be able to sign it before he gets to hawaii, bret. 

[00:18:35]


>> We're under two minute warning just seeing his aides putting remarks up there on the podium. And is there any indication about th stance, how much he was working with democrats? YOU KNOW VICE PRESIDENT BIDENt- Running a point there for a long time. 
>> Good to mention that vice president biden because there is some indication that's he might be joining t president for this statement tonight. We'll see if he does. But he was pivotal in this in working with the senator but the president's aides say that he was working phones in the last day or so. In firming up the final details of this, working directly with those democratic leaders. Both nancy pelosi and hairy reid working through details of the sequester, then, of course, vice president biden running point and going up to the hill two days in a row now, last night, as you know a little bit of a rescue mission to make sure some of the senators on the left were not going jump ship. Most stayed with the president, then, y saw in the house vice president biden went up there to lobby them that, was a successful effort because in the end it was house democrat who's carried this across the goal line. It was not house republicans. 
>> Okay, wetd, we'll let you sit down. We, speaking of house democrats just got word from nancy pelosi cite prog gres saying this is a win for the middle class, releasing a statement saying its a blood pressure legislation promoting economic growth asking wealthyest americans to pay their fair share, extending unemt employment insurance for those who lost their jobs through no fault of their own, saying quote I'm proud of the unity in-house democratic caucus of our ongoing commitment. Let's listen to the president. 
>> My central premise was to change the tax code that was too skewed towards the wealthy at the expense of working middle class americans. Tonight, we have done that. Thanks to the votes, democrats and republicans in congress, i will sign a law that raises taxes on the wealthyest 2% of americans while preventing a middle class tax hike that could have sent the economy back into a reskpegs have a severe impact on family as cross america. I want to thank all leaders of the house and senate. In particular, I want to thank the work that was done by my extraordinary vice president joe biden as well as leader hairy reid, speaker boehner, nancy pelosi and mitch McCONNELL. Everybody worked hard on this and I appreciate it. Joe, thank you for your great work. Under this law, more than 98% of americans and 97% of small businesses will not see their income taxes go up. Millions of families will continue to see tax breaks to help raise their kids and is sent them to college. Companies will continue to receive tax credits. For research and investments and clean energy jobs they create. Two million americans out of work and out there looking pounding pavement every day goring to continue to receive unemployment benefits as lng as they're actively looking for a job. But... I think we all recognize this law is just one step in a blauder effort to strengthen our economy and broaden opportunity for everybody. The fact is that the deficit is still too high. And we're still investing too little in the things we need for the economy to grow as fast as it should. That is why speaker boehner and I tried to negotiate larger agreement that's would put this country on a path to paying down debt, while also putting americans back to work rebuilding roads and bridges and proviing investments in areas like education and job training. Unfortunately, there just wasn't enough support or time for that kind of large agreement in lame duck session of congress. That failure come was a cost. As the needs for the process over several weeks made business more uncertain. And consumers less confident. But, we're continuing to chip away at this problem. Step by step. Last year, I signed into law $1.7 trillion in deficit reduction. Tonight's agreement further reduces deficit by raising $620 billion in revenue from the wealthyest households in america. And there will be more deficit reduction as congress decides what to do about the automatic spending cuts that we have now delayed two months. I want to make this point as I'm demonstrating throughout the past several weeks, I am very open to compromise. I agree with democrats and republicans that the aging population and rising cost of health care makes medicare biggest contributer to our deficit. I believe we've got to find ways to reform that program without hurting seniors who count on it to survive z i believe that there is further unnecessary spending in government that we can eliminate. But, we can't simply cut our way to prosperity. Cutting spending has to go hand in hand with further reforms towards tax codes that wealthyest corporations and individuals can take advantage of loopholes and deductions that aren't available to most americans. And we can't keep cutting egg things like basic research, new technology and still expect to succeed in the 21 century economy. So we're going have to continue to move forward in deficit reduction, but we have to do knit a balanced way, making sure we're growing, as we get a handle on spending. Now, one last point I want to make, while I will negotiate over many things, I will not have another debate with this congress over whether or not they should pay bills that they've racked up. Through the laws they've passed. Let me repeat. We can't not pay bills that we've already incurred. If congress refuses to give the united states government ability to pay these bills on time, the consequences for the global economy would be catastrophic, far worse than the impact of a fiscal cliff. People remember in 2011 last time this course of action was present, our entire recovery was put at risk. Consumer confidence plunged to business investment plunged. Growth dropped. We can't go down that path again. Today's agreement enshrines i think a principle into law that will remain in place as long as I am president, the deficit needs to be reduced in a way that is balanced. Everyone pays their fair share, everyone does their part that. Is how our economy works best. That is how we grow. The sum total of all budget agreements we've reached so far prove there's is a path forward. That it is possible. If we focus not on our politic buzz what is right for the country. And the one thing I think hopefully we'll focus is seeing if we can put a package like this together with by little bit less drauma, more brinksmanship, not scare the heck out of folks quite as much. We can come together as democrats and republicans to cut spending and raise revenue in a way reduces our deficit, protects our middle class, provides ladders into the middle class for everybody willing to work hard, we can find a way to afford investments we need to grow and compete. We can settle this debate or at the least not allow it to be so all consuming all t time it stops us from meeting other challenges, creating jobs, boosting incomes. Fixing our immigration systems. Protecting our planet are from harmful affects of climate change. Boosting domestic energy production. Protecting our kids from horrors of gun violence, it's an obligation to ourselves and future generations and I look forward to working with every member of congress to meet this obligation in the new year. I hope everybody now gets at least a day off, I guess or a few days off. So that people can refresh themselves because we're going to have a lot of work to do in 2013. Thanks everybody, happy new year.

>> President obama got memo to wear the same tie there getting praise for his working with senate republicans vice president biden that,. The president saying leaders did the right thing passing legislation in the house tonight and in the senate early this morning to avoid the fiscal cliff. Used phrases that he has used before saying that the deficit needs to be reduced in a way that is balanced saying he will not have another debate with this congress over paying u.S. Bills up against the debt ceiling debate. Republicans and mitch McCONNELL WORKING VERY CLOSELY With vice president biden signaled that that debate is coming. That very debate that the president said he will not have, again. Let's bring in our panel for final thoughts. Steve hays, amy stoddard and charles krauthammer. Charles? 
>> I think the president laid down the marker. We have to increase investments which is democratic way of saying spending growth, bridges, are indeed education etc.. So it's clear he wants to increase spending he's willing to give a nod to a cut here and there but wants more spending and more taxes that. Is what he said again and again. We have to raise revenues, close loopholes so he's going get a seconds shot at raising taxes. That, I think is his objective. He repeated this idea I'm not going to debate. Speaking about raising the debt ceiling. I think that is a bluff he cannot keep. He's going to put the economy in jeopardy. Last time we had a debt ceiling issue his pop lrt sank. Sank from republicans in the house I'm not sure he wants to carry that risk. 
>> I think charles is right he's going take another shot at raising taxes. I don't know if he's going to get another shot. He did make it clear spending cuts are on the table but it has to be balanced and he is sounding like he is going to keep fighting. And that is going to be a battle with republicans. In wk skbz months to come. Others noted it's the sequester patch, continuing resolution to keep the government running and we'll be at the brink all the time. 

[00:30:21]


>> Well, look look in conthem. Is never gok a good outcome for republicans we've known that are from election day. Here we are. It's not a good outcome for republicans. I think the president is wrong he won't be having the debate over a debt limit as a matter of fact. Republicans are think are right to push that. They understand the thrust of the debate for the better part of the year has been on taxes. Has been on revenues and a debate and an argument led by the president but everybody knows including reporters and everybody studying this problems we've faced understand that's spending is the issue. That you can't have 62% of your budget taken bip entitlement spending and solve problems by raising taxes on a small silver of south american americans. The key at this point is to come up with an understandable message and alternative message to what the president is going to be pushing. In both chambers of congress, stick with it. Make it a clear argument. 
>> Panel, thank you very much. It's been a busy first day of 2013. I want to bring in for thoughts "wall street journal" senior economics writer steve moore covering fiscal cliff from the beginning when it's just a little, I don't know. Mole hill. A cliff. Now, what is it? How wall street reacted whachl is your reaction. 
>> Wall street will probably react that this is finally over. But this is, as you've been saying all night, this ain't over. This is the first stage of the debate. And I think the president is going to have a big tight fight on his hands, the debt ceiling which is the next big fiscal issue what. Is interesting is that the president said the other day when the deal was first kind of broched, then just said this again in the statement that he wants a balanced approach going forward. And I can guarantee you this that republicans are in no mood for tax increases this year, I think that is where they're going to lock horns. What this debate has been about is not little issues. This is not small this, is the difference between the two parties where democrats say we want to grow the government ask have higher taxes to pay for it. Republicans say we want the private sector to grow and think raising taxes is bad for the economy. 

[00:33:00]


>> And steve, I guess the question is that you heard the simpson bowles detailed reaction. At points, scathing. Is this president prepared to deal in this second term on those big issues talked about by his own deficit and debt commission. 
>> So far, he's not. When I've talked to the republican leaders over last few weeks they've just expressed such utter frustration that there were really no agreements. They won't budth an inch. This is -- they won the first inning of the game here. I think the republicans will be more fighting in the week as head to say this, bre text president obama we stril a trillion dollar receive sit -- deficit what. Is your next act? I think that puts president obama on weaker foot goinging forward in weeks and months ahead. 
>> Steve moore thank you very much. Before I go, charles, final word? 
>> Obama announced he's not here to destroy or undo entitlement statement state he's in favor of it and that is where he's going to stand. 
>> Thank you very much. A busy first day of 2013. The fis clal cliff legislation is passed and we may not say those two words again, fis skal cliff but there will be other words we use to describe whatever sit we're pushing up against here. Washington will do this again. We've talked about tonight. And we'll be here in washington to cover it for you. On fox news channel. Thank you very much for watching our special coverage of this night and over the past two days. Bill o'reilly's special is already in progress. And we'll join that next. Good night from washington. >> 

[00:37:11]


>> the talking points memo this evening, all of us, all of us need to wise up and fast. You may have heard the story of new york city police officer lawrence deprimo, who spent $100 of his own money to give a barefoot homeless man some boots. That man, jeffrey hillman, was lying in the street when officer spotted him. 
>> It was extremely cold that night and you see this gentleman, I tried to offer him to buy him a pair of socks and he said, no, sir, god bless you. Thank you for asking. When I see something like that, here it is, it's freezing cold out and he had the hrt to say god bless me and I had to help him. 
>> Obviously, officer deprimo is a patriot. And mr. Hillman is not homeless, he has an apartment paid for by you and me, he has enough to live in a dignified manner. He doesn't prefer that, he prefers the street and the boots that the officer gave him have disappeared. Now I'm not judging hillman, most cases like his involve substance abuse or mental illness, however, we must be honest, the government cannot provide a decent life for hillman. No matter how much money it spends. We're already giving the die tens of thousands of dollars a year and it's doing nothing. There are millions of americans like jeffrey hillman and we all need to understand that some people simply will not, will not save themselves. This translates to an issue that affects all of us. Right now an estimated 66 million americans are receiving food stamps and/or medicaid. In addition, there are 21 million folks working for the government. That means that 87 million people in america are being subsidized by we, the taxpayers. But there are only 109 million americans working in the private sector. Doing the math, it's impossible for 109 million workers to support 87 million people. It can't be done. No matter how much you tax the workers. Yet, the obama administration and the democratic party continue to put forth that higher taxation will bring the massive government debt under contr. Perhaps the only democrat telling the truth about this is our old pal, howard dean, the uber liberal former governor of vermont. 

[00:39:42]


>> The truth is everybody needs to pay more taxes, not just the rich. That's a good start, but we're not going to get out of this deficit problem unless we raise taxes across the board. 
>> Bill: Now, governor dean mpathizes with the socialist philosophy and that's where the country is heading. Taking from those who are productive and giving to those who are struggling. Or who are working for the massive government apparatus. During this christmas season, I think we all should emulate officer deprimo, we should try to help those in need, but that help may beutile, if the government doesn't wise up and stop the incredible entitlement spending, america's economy will eventually collapse. President obama needs to invite jeffrey hillman to the white house. He needs to talk to the man with no shoes. He needs to see what is actually happening in this country. Got to get rea about government spending. Now, the top story tonight, this is incredible, the pennsylvania department of public welfare says that a single mother with two children is better off taking a job that pays $29,000 a year than a job that pays $69,000 a year. Why? Cost of entitlements. Joining us now from our new york studio,ox business anchor lou dobbs. So, lou, explain this, please. 
>> Well, bill, first, I think we need to give great credit to the department of public welfare in pennsylvania. They're being honest and straight forward and I wish the federal government, as you do, would listen. Think about the benefits received by this woman. 25,000 in a take home salary of $57,000, you add to that all of the expenses that we go through, whether it's child care, whether it is transportation. In the instance, one parent and two children in pennsylvania, food stamps amounts to a subsidy of $6300 a year to that family of three. Medicare and child health insurance, $16,500 a year. Section 8 subsidized low income rent. Another 4300. Earned income tax credits, modestly, $5,000. They could rise significantly beyond that. But, at any rate, they would total so much money combined with what is the national school lunch program, the needy family assistance programs, we're talking about more take home pay, disposable income, for that woman with her two children on public assistance than a woman with two children earning $57,000 a year. It's extraordinary. 

[00:42:39]


>> Bill: All right. And if she were 69 she wouldn't get any of that. 
>> Right. 
>> Bill: So the pennsylvania authorities say the system is set up now to reward people who aren't making any money and if you try to bring yourself up and raise yourself up in salary, you're actually going to have a lower standard of living because you lose some of the benefits. That's the game right now. 
>> It's the game and it's also the challenge because they're trying to avoid that collision. Because, it doesn't matter, in this one instance, what we're talking about here, if you're a socialist or if you're a capital list, we're talking about government subsidizing and incentivizing behavior. 
>> Did I pick on this jeffrey hillman guy, the homeless guy? This guy, he has his apartment paid for, medicaid, food stamps, he got it all. There he is in the street. Am I being unfair to him? 
>> I don't think so at all. Bill, I think what you're pointing out, it's extraordinary our president who spent much of his life as a community organizer is more interested in expanding government than it is in organizing and supporting communities which are really the answer to mr. Hillman's tragedy. 
>> Bill: Solving these kind of problems. 
>> Absolutely. 
>> Bill: How thehehehehehehe 

[00:46:40]


>> liberals and conservatives ganging up on mitt romney. That's the subject of this evening's talking points memo. One of the bad things about america is that some of us feel that we can kick people when they're down. That's exactly what's happening to mitt romney right now. Billions of americans are very disappointed that the governor did not wage a more aggressive campaign to unseat president obama. And instead he played safe and libya the third debate and sitting on it the last eight days of the campaign. After hurricane sandy hit the east coast, the governor disappeared from the news cycle, apparently that was fine with him, he had many opportunities to speak with urgency in the the last weekend, but passed. So president obama's team run by the brilliant david axlerod won the fourth quarter big. They could point at voters who might support them and get them out on election day. The romney campaign made local appearances, saying the same thing over and over and over. Early on election night when trends began to appear I said this, the changing country, the demographics are changing it's not a traditional america anymore and there are 50% of the voting public who want stuff. They want things. And who is going to give them things? President obama. He knows it, and he ran on it. 
>> Bill: Now, that's the truth. And there's no denying the statistics in exit polling. However some liberal americans were outraged that I would actually say the truth and I'll teou why in a moment. And eight days after, mitt romney held a conference with his donors and say pretty much what I said. 
>> And what president obama did was focus on members in his base coalition and give them extraordinary financial gifts from the government and then work very aggressively to turn them out to vote. 
>> Bill: Again, that's the truth. And here is the backup. 20% of those who voted on election day make under $30,000 a year. Th folks are either poor o close to it. Many of those voters receive entitlements, food stamps, housing subsidies, that kind of thing and of course, they don't want the programs cut or reorganized. Among americans making less than 30,000 bucks a year, 63%, 63% voted for barack obama. Just 35% voted for mitt romney. From that group, the president received about 7 million more votes than romney did. Mr. Obama won the popular vote by 3 1/2 million. So, is a stone-cold fact that lower income americans largely reelected president obama. Mitt romney's failure is very clear. He could not convince the majority of voters that he would look out for them period. He did not show enough outrage every his 16 trillion dollar debt or explain what that could lead to. A total economic collapse. Romney was timid, wasn't paul revere spreading the word about danger. Ask yourself this question: What do you think those makes less than $30,000 a year were voting for? What were they voting for? Do you think they were voting for massive debt? Why they voting for continued chaos in the middle east? Were they voting for more government regulations that inhibit businesses from hirg working people? Were they voting for 8% employment to keep salaries down because there are more workers than jobs? Were they voting for any of that? No. Millions of lower income americans voted for the candidate who they thought was going to directly help them financially. Not every obama voter did that, but many absolutely did. Now, going forward, the republican party does have to change. It can't disparage poor people, it has to engage them. That's to demonstrate that a healthy economy, based on discipline and robust capitalism, will lift far more people out of poverty than government handouts will. You've got to sell that. Romney didn't. Finally, governor romney also did not confront the far left fanatics to demonize them and let me give you a perfect example. "The washington post" editorialized last week, that i, your humble correspondent, served up a bigoted commentary on election night, quote, a couple of hours before president obama was declared the vick toy bill o'reilly offered his explanation why mitt romney was about to lose because it's a changing country it's not a traditional america anymore. In case anyone might be confused about the meaning of traditional, he elaborated, white establishment is now minority. In other words, the problem was too many voters of color. How vile. How vile. In other words, you pinheads have no right to lie about me by putting fabricated words in my mouth. That's not what I said. You disgrace the journalism industry. You seek to demonize anyone who disagrees with your far left view. Am I being clear enough? The white establishment no longer dominates the political field in america. That is crystal clear. I don't lament that. I'm not pining for a return to calvin coolidge, I just reported it, but for crazed ideologues, that's inconsequence. They summed up saying, quote, it's encouraging that many republicans are repuding and contemptuous, contemptible o'reilly-mitt romney world view. Here is what's really contemptible, you guys spinning an honest look at the vote as a diatribe against poor people minorities. That's what is contemptible. "The washington post" staff could not care less about the truth, that american society is dependent on a giant federal map which cannot possibly afford all the stuff it's giving out. That's the truth. We are turning into a western europe and that's exactly what "the washington post" wants. Their world view is destructive to america and it will be cfronted here. That's memo. 

[00:53:18]


>> Another rundown, mary 

[00:55:29]


>> liberal and conservative america attacking mitt romney and me over entitlements. Joining us from washington, mary katherine ham and juan williams, both fox news analysts. Juan, you used to work for "the washington post"? What about that piece, the o'reilly-romney view of the worl sounds like I ran and he's vp on the ticket. 
>> When they start with the name calling, I've got no use for it, bill. I had to deal with it as a black person on school vouchers, as well as comments about airport. That's not the what I said, that's not what I'm thinking and that's just crazy. And I think that romney and ryan, romney spoke about the president's base as if he was rewarded elements of the base. Ryan spoke about an urban population, that's getting closer and it's worrisome, but the real issue I have and the one iant to discuss with you is what you said in the talking points memo because i don't think people necessarily voted in terms of their economic interests. I think there are lots of poor people, I think there are lots of seniors who receive medicare and social security who voted for mitt romney. I think there are lots of people in the suburbs of new york, connecticut and new jersey who are in some of the these big companies that have to pay higher taxes under president obama who nonetheless believe that obama was a better candidate and voted for the best of america. 
>> Bill: Look, juan, you've got to be-- the stats are overwhelming, you can't tell me that economics were the primary voting force for president obama, you can't say it, it's not true. 
>> First of all, let me say i agree he with juan unfair of the post and many in the media pointing out some of the statistics about the election and actually pointing out that indeed, minorities increased in turnout and in urban areas, yes, in cities where the g.O.P. Has problems relating to folks and bringing folks into their fold and voting for them. Those are not racist statements and we need to get away from that if we're going to analyze like we want to. But I will say that I think, you know, you said yourself that some 30-something percent of under 30,000 a year voted for romney. So I don't think -- and i don't think those that voted for obama are necessarily completely ruled by whatever, whatever-- 

[00:57:44]


>> and if you're going to say that, wait, wait, mary katherine. If you're going to say that, that's going to be your point of view. You have to fill in the blanks. What did they vote for? I just listed eight things, did they vote for 8% unemployment. 16,000 -- what did they vote for? 
>> They didn't believe that romney was on their side and had their back. That's a failure of our own and romney's campaign. 
>> Bill: Now we're getting someplace. Do you know, juan. I think when you go back to 47%, i think people feel he was looking out for the top 2% and big corporations, what's mary katherine said, he wasn't for them. 
>> Bill: We all three agree, all three of us agree under 37 drew didn't think-- and what did they vote for in reelecting president obama? 
>> I think they voted for a country where they feel as seniors, as veterans, as people who may be disabled that the country moving forward, especially in terms of this fiscal cliff and economic decisions about budget priorities would be-- ike high school, there's got to be more than understanding and-- 
>> they don't think. 
>> Bill: Move forward where? 
>> Move forward in this economy. You said and something i disagree he with. 8% unemployment. 16 trillion dollar debt we're not moving forward, juan. 
>> We are moving forward. 
>> Bill: No reason we're moving forward. 
>> Yes, and I think that most americans disagree with you and think that the economy is finally starting to go for it and in fact. 
>> Bill: Based on what? 
>> If you just-- 
>> based on what? 
>> If you don't invest in education, infrastructure and the american people and just give money back to the rich then you go back to the days where, you know, less taxes, less regulations and-- 
>> you're both disagreeing, but you're agreeing in a round-about way and I've got to run. It's about money-- 
>> and a larger part of the identification, playing a large part-- 
>> no, this was about money. Again, thank you for watching us tonight. I am bill o'reilly, please

=======================================================

With us tonight. In 2012 we earthlings got to see what mars looks like. It turns out mars looks kind of amazing. In 2012 we had one of the most successful and riveting olympics ever. If you're in the center or on the left it's a probably cause for celebration. There are many causes for celebrations in terms of what happened in 2012. That said, even with all that, kind of feels like 2012 is going to be a year we'll be happy to see the end of. American shootings from newtown to aurora to oak creek. A full year of the war in syria, another year of the war in gaza, the euro crisis, penn state, trayvon martin, petraeus, 2012 is a year in many ways, forget the phrase, sucked, which is why it's been worth it as ever to con come the things that did not suck. That did not suck about this year. Legitimately without irony or only with a trace amount. Behold a clear year that sucked much less than you remember it sucking. Everybody on thiow is a 13-year-old boy. They were all giggling over this. Apparently someone drawing a circle around the florida panhandle is hilarious. Whether it is chuck todd or this from cnn because he's putting his hands on it. Members of my staff swear putting shapes on the state of florida is all problematic. Yes, I get it. I get it less than most people. I do see something in the associated press map. Mitt romney won the counties in orange, newt gingrich won the ones in red. Do you see that? Look closer. They totally saw it. It's a giraffe! Best new thing in the world today. You are grounded, staffers. This photo of mitt romney in iowa in october 2007 is the greatest campaign trail photo of modern times. In 2008 the gettings were so good in terms of campaign photos that the famous romney fudge photo even had a close second runner-up with this one, right? Remember this one? I still have no idea what was going on in this picture. Between our winner and first runner-up, obviously, 2008 will never be surpassed in terms of genius photos from the presidential campaign trail. That doesn't mean we're not looking for contenders in 2012. Behold, america, we have a contender. This exists. This exists! And what's going on in this picture? I don't know and neither do you. The caption, unhelpfully explains, republican candidate house speaker newt gingrich pinches the nose of bonnie ellison of south carolina while shaking hands with supporters. Yes, clearly, he's pinching, he's doing that, but why is he grabbing her nose? He just reached right out and grabbed her face. Again, why? Nobody knows, which is part of the wonder and perfection of it. We here at "the rachel maddow show" had to snatch up the santorum-related real estate. Early in his career he was going door to door to find himself in a it, we have purchased and taken off the market dog pee can't stop santorum.Com. It will now live forever as a redirect to our website. We still own that url to this day. We were smart to grab that. We now have video proof that he tells the dog pee can't stop me story on the campaign trail. Here he is saturday night. 

[00:04:14]


>> She hands me the glass of water and the dog jumps in my lap. Okay. We still own that url to this day. We were smart to grab that. We now have video proof that he tells the dog pee can't stop me story on the campaign trail. Here he is saturday night. 
>> She hands me the glass of water and the dog jumps in my lap. Okay. Fine. I pet the dog, have a sip or two of water. The next thing I know there's a warm sensation on my lap. There's a huge wet spot. I start to move out the door. She goes take your pants off and I'll put them in the drier. That was the last I heard from her because I was out the door. Now I'm walking down the sidewalk and at the end I'm two hours into my walk. I'm a mile from where my car is. It's still lots of daylight left. What do you do? Undeterred I soldiered on. 
>> What did we pay for that url, 15 bucks. Dog pee can't stop santorum.Com. Tell your friends. 
>> Let the record show when rick santorum held her. She's not yet crying. 
>> She's happy. She's going to vote. 
>> What does it say? 
>> One day I will vote. 

[00:06:15]


>> Look at her shoes. 
>> President obama will be visiting thailand but he boent be staying long. It's three countries in three days. Because they can't schedule a bunch of official stops for the president to see all of thailands most famous sights, the u.S. Embassy came up with another idea. We call it president fauxbama. A cardboard cut out which the embassy has photographed. They have done ten of these in all. Flat president obama posed at famous thai landmarks. Even though we thought they toted him around the country to do this, these are theme park replicas of major lan marks across thailand. It's fauxbama visiting faux thailand. Before this presidential campaign, remember that newt gingrich was the live newt girls guy. The former speaker of the house making money with direct mail an giving people fake awards that you had to pay thousands of dollars to collect. 
>> You say you shouldn't go to work before you're 14, 16 years old. You're totally poor. I tried to have a very simple model 37 most of these schools ought to get rid of unionized janitors and have one a master janitor and pay local students to take care of the school. The nra has been too timid. I want to explain what I mean. A gingrich presidency will submit to the united nations a treaty that extends the right to bear arms as a human right for every person on the planet. By the end of my second term -- 

[00:08:30]


[ applause ] we will have the first permanent base on the moon an it will be american. 
>> That last inspired us to do the following for whh I will be eternally grateful. Greatings from the year 2019. Obviously, I'm on the moon where newt gingrich is the president of the moon. How can anybody be president of the moon you ask from the past where you live. Back when he was just candidate gingrich, president newt not only promised a permanent colony on the moon but the end of the second term but he delayed would be an american colony. He said once he figured out how to get a few thousand americans up here, the moon could then become the 51st state. Don't you miss the news when newt gingrich was the front-runner for the republican nomination. That happened in our lifetimes america. He was running first. You think mitt romney will inspire anybody to wear a space costume on a news show. Will mitt romney ever reveal his true self via ring tone. Newt gingrich's ring tone is dancing queen. I think that nobody's going to take a chance on newt gingrich. I could be wrong. Can you hear what he is playing? This is dancing queen by abba. I paid for the dancing queen ring tone and I'm keeping it. Good-bye, sir. We will miss you until you do it again in four years, if you can figure out how to make money off of it. I live for days like this in politics. Easily the best new ing in my world today. Best new thing in the world today. Everybody's today's news best new thing in the world. Best new thing in the world. There's a lot of them. Hold on. We'll be right back. Not many people want to be outside in unless they have to. Only a few people by which i mean a few thousand people bundled up in their rain gear and headed out to grant park in chicago to cheer on veterans of the iraq war and the afghanistan war as the second city staged the second welcome home parade. To say welcome home to the soldiers. Go chicago. There were marching bands and motorcycles and war dogs and more than a thousand veterans turning out to hear thank you. With the december 15th parade, chicago became the biggest city in the united states to hold an event like this one. Maybe in the year 2013 an event like this will take place in new york city. All yearlong regular joe and jane citizens took the initiative and decided to do it on their own. Every time they did it it was the best new thing in the world. Our nation's first ever, look at that, first ever parade for troops coming home from the war in iraq. It happened saturday in st. Louis, missouri. Tens of thousands of people lined the streets. This is a thank you big enough to make the nation notice and personal enough to grab your heart and rattle it a little. 

[00:16:31]


>> Twice he's flown home after serving in iraq. 
>> You could drop me in any city in the united states because i was home. 
>> Reporter: He was touched by the out pouring of his hometown. 
>> Completely overwhelmed. 
>> Our nation has been debating whether now is a good time to celebrate veterans coming home from iraq with so many of them be redeployed to afghanistan. It's war that's ongoing. On sunday the new york giants will be playing the new england patriots known as the super bowl. The winning team gets a big parade downtown. The new york giants got one in 2008 the last year they were champions. The patriots got one in 2005. There's nothing wrong with celebrating football. I wonder if it won't be weird for our country to go crazy over a sports team while still saying not yet to the veterans. My friend asked that flat out tonight are you really okay with your football team getting a ticker tape parade and not your iraq vets. I have a question for any military veterans watching now. Do you want to rock and roll all night and party every day? You may get your chance because kiss is hiring a roadie. They are looking for a set carpenter to help assemble their stage and operate official effects and take it down when the show is over. They say it's a hard job and need to be prepared to work hard, long hours. They want to hire a veteran to do this job. That's a great thing for someone who occupies that overlapping spot between the u.S. Mily and the kiss army. Great as that is, that's not the best new thing in the world. This is the best new thing. Tomorrow tucson, arizona will look like this. These are pictures of the first ever parade in the united states to mark the end of the iraq war. To say welcome home and thank you to iraq war veterans. The war ended in december. This first parade was in st. Louis. Tomorrow the second big parade in the united states of america to mark the end of the war. This time it will the be leld in tucson, arizona. This isn't the military or government coming up with this idea. This is just citizens. This organizers say they were inspired by what st. Lid. We've had three debates so far. The candidates have spent five hours arguing about medicare and social security and jobs. They are argued over the rules of the debate and big bird. There's been no talk about how we are treating veterans. Lots of americans have been thinking about this generation of veterans that come ho need a job. Ordinary americans are holding their own parades. Welcome home love florida and tucson and new england coastal ports smith new hampshire. The pentagon, for reasons that i do not start to understand, still say they do not want new york city to hold a parade. New york city is where we've always done this. New york did throw one ticker tape parade for the new york giants and at their parade the football parade, we met the willis family. They brought a picture of her son and a huge giants fan. Sergeant willis sent a message before the big game. 

[00:21:14]


>> I'm from new york. I want to say hi to my family and go big blue. 
>> His mom said she promised she would go to the parade if the giants won and she would bring his picture. The giants won and new york held the parade and glenda kept her promise. She said it would be compassionate to have a parade for her son and daughter in new york. Tonight, there's still no parade in the works for new york city to welcome home the troops and mark the end of the iraq war. I can tell you that sergeant willis is home from iraq and afghanistan and he and his family are here with us watching the show in this very room. Welcome home. Look, you're on tv. It's really cool to have you here and it's the best new thing in the world today. St. Louis, missouri pulling off its welcome home heroes parade. They did it first in the country. There will be more to come. Best new thing in the world. They keep getting better from here. Stay with us. 

[00:25:29]


>>> Whether it's helping to tag a bear in the wild or tranquilizing a tiger or shooting a gray whale to collect skin samples or discovering two greek urns in the black sea or whether it's riding a motorbike or putting out wildfires from a plane, whether it's showing off his judo moves or swimming in a siberian lake topless or fishing topless or riding a horse topless. It's inarguable that russia's president is manly of the photo op. His newest is hockey star. There's one best new thing this year that included a mystery guest impersonating the anchor of this show in a way that made me want to quit and make her the host of the show. That's coming up. Stay with us. 

[00:29:22]


>>> The best new thing in the world today is a growth opportunity for republican political strategist. A lucrative source of revenue just waiting to be tapped. I, jane lynch, am not one to give career advice to republicans but there's money to be made on promoting gay rights within the republican party. You see the defacto head of the republican party has taken a strong position on the side of the gay rights debate that if you're a politician it's the side you don't want to be on. The rest of his party may be about to evolve around him. This weekend a respective republican pollster, one who helped george w. Bush win re-election wrote an operative saying I've got a lot of polling and the gay marriage thing is getting popular. He suggested republicans might want to change the way they talk about stuff like gay marriage. Maybe start saying that support for gay marriage is consistent with conservative fundamentals. As people who promote personal responsibility, family values, commitment and stability and emphasize freedom and limited government, we have to recog that freedom means freedom for every one. This includes the freedom to decide how you live and to enter into relationships of your choosing. The freedom to live without excessive interference of the force. That's a republican telling republicans to reconsider gay rights. He may be one of the first to do it but he won't be the last. Jane lynch, where's the job opportunity in all of this. One will have to teach republicans how to talk about gay rights without seeming like they have caved. Some strategists will have to make it their specialty to teach republicans how to be pro-gay while still sounding angry. That's a tall order but you can charge more money. Republicans are trying to figure out how to choose gracefully. Best new thing in the world today. 

[00:31:35]


>> You're the best new thing in the world today. When you said folks. Do I do that? 
>> You do. I was mocking you. 
>> I felt it in painful way. Thank you for doing the best new thing in the world. 
>> Thank you for having me. 
>> I'm in the guest chair. 
>> How does it feel? 
>> A little subservient. Do you want to be cable host? 
>> I'd love to play one. I know how you workday in and day out. 
>> You had a republican pollster memo in mind. The thing about the subject of what you just talked about that's interesting is this is something, you're out sue sylvester on "glee," and you've written this coming out story and we are in a moment when the politics of gay rights are rapidly changing the country. 
>> I know. Really fast. It's an issue that I have not really taken personally so much. It's something that I watch on television with great interest. I have a stake in it. I've got skin in the game but when the president came out and said that he supported the dignity of our families and our relationships that really moved me. That really touched me for the first time. I realized I had been kind of distanced emotionally from it but that broke it open for me. It made me happy. 
>> That's one of those things that covering it as a gay person, thinking about it as a gay person and covering it as a person in the news. I felt like half of me had to have talk with the other half. The way that was responded to and the way people are talking about it in politics world, how many people agree with the president? It's going to help with them and how many people disagree and it will hurt with them? The gay part of me, the human part wants to explain, the big issue, the big question is not already who agrees with him but who is still changing their mind? Does this change history? 

[00:33:52]


>> I don't know if it changes history. I don't know if it was political calculus on his part but I think he believes in the dignity of our relationships and our right to exist. I think there are people we're not going to get and that's fine and probably not in this lifetime but I think there are changeable folks. A lot of people change when they are in the presence of one of us. They get to know us and our family. I think that's being -- I think that's why being out, for me any way, is important. Allowing myself to appear in public with my family and not hiding about it and I think that's really important. 
>> I have a sound bite that i wanted to play that was from before president obama said what he did. A few days before that vice president biden to everybody's surprise started talking about how he was all in favor of same sex marriage rights but he hit a pop culture tv stone when he have saying that. 
>> This is evolving. My measure david and I take a look at when things change is when the social culture changes. I think will and grace probably did more to educate the american public than almost anything anybody's ever done so far. I think people fear that which is different. Now they are beginning to understand. 
>> As a person who is part of the phenomenon that is glee, how do you think it felt to the will and grace people to be mentioned? 
>> I know all four of them and I'm sure they are thrilled about it. When they first did that show and nbc sat them down and say this could turn into a huge thing and you might be threatened. It might get ugly. It never happened. These are flawed characters. They are funny. You laugh at them. You want to go into that apartment whatever night it was on. Like biden said, you have to put us out in the culture and see who we are. If we're flawed it has nothing to do with our orientation. It's because we're human beings. 

[00:36:13]


>> As people know more gay people, as more people come out that tends to start to soften attitudes about gay rights. Is there an extension as people are exposed through culture or tv that that also has that affect? 
>> Absolutely. People come up to me like they know me because I appear on their television. 
>> They want you to bully them. 
>> Say something mean to me. They think we're they're friends. We do befriend the people on our television. The creator of our show takes this seriously. That's why he has ever flavor of kid in the glee club. He wants every kid to have somebody they can point to and go that's me and look I'm being supported. I'm in place where people have my back and I get to raise my voice in song. 
>> I always felt like one of the things that I would always try to explain to people about what I learned from junior high and high school is that popularity doesn't buy you anything in later life. Really you ought to look for the kids who are -- the dorkier you are at those important ages, the cooler you're probably going to be as an adult. It's not always true but that's what I observed. 
>> If you're a dork or geek it's because it's that time in your life and your genuine. You're not trying to be somebody else. How many stars have we heard about that failed as adults because they haven't gone through that. They haven't gotten to know their true self. 
>> I feel like I'm waiting to meet my true self. It's going to be in a dark alley and it's going to be a fight. The president completing his evolution. On the right in the republican party mitt romney has gone the other direction in his stance on gay rights. When he ran for senate he said he would reach to the left and now he's not only against equal marriage right, he's against civil unions. 

[00:38:32]


>> Even us talking together now he's probably ainst that. 
>> It's probably illegal somewhere and he supports that states right to make it that way. I understand how people evolve on this issue. It's harder to undstand how people devolve. 
>> I don't buy it. I don't think it's genuine. I think it's politically calculated. 
>> Mitt romney. 
>> I think deep down inside. 
>> If he wants to come on the show or fake me, which is you, that would be awesome. 
>> The final e airs next news on fox and the new book which is awesome is now on paper back. Thank you very much. 
>> Thank you very much. Any time you want to do the show I can lend you an $11 blazer. 

[00:43:10]


> > This week, this picture became a brand new idea to everybody on the internet machine. It became a hook for the best new politics mean we've had in a long time. Hey, girl. It's madame secretary. The former secretary of state said then I left her a text saying I left my favorite sunglasses. Sorry. I haven't seen them. Hey, hill what you doing? Running the world. I love this text from hillary clinton. Fish and game were able to corner the bear in somebody's back ward but not before the best new thing in the world happened. One guy learned a lesson about texting and walking. See the guy. It's a bear. Can we see that dpen. There's the bear. There's the guy texting looking down. Then little something. Oh, run away. Advice is don't run away. Make noise and try to appear as large as possible. Texting dude is okay. Also bear is okay. Tranquilized and transported to the national forest for release back into the wild even if it does have an unsightly ear tag. 
>> When you are this close to hoover dam it makes you realize how sml a human is. You can't be the town who builds this. You can be the guy that stops something like this. We've got a project like this waiting for the president's go ahead supported by republicans and democrats. It provides energy security and up to 130,000 jobs. 
>> National republican congressional committee, you nailed me. You got me exactly right. It's uncanny. There is no poop fairy. There's no winged creature ready to sweep out of guy. We have just received word that the simultaneously disillusioning and destructive don't believe in the poop fairy campaign is expanding. They are planning to reveal it this spring. Way back in 2004 an early it ration of the poop fairy was unveiled. 

[00:45:52]


>> Do your part and scoop the poop. There's no such thing as the poop fairy. 
>> Good move as adopting it as your own. It worked in colorado. The original poop fairy was from virginia. She was a chocolate lab. 
>> It's the dutch word for yummy. The noise the scooter makes the yummy, dominos. Watch it in action on the street. The best part is it's just a going making the noise. ???????????? somebody's cutting up onions in the studio. Perhaps my allergies are acting up. I'm a crier. You can't do this to me. The parents are named chowder and clementine. They have nine children. He's the weird one named kevin. Mr. Putin took to the rink. He was on team of amateurs. President putin's team won. It's how his team won and his role in the glory that's important. Can your american president score a hockey goal? Oh, yeah. Putin can. Can we look at that for a second. Here is the first pass and there's president putin missing it. Here, far, far away is the defender. The guy way out there. The defender from the team of the best players, president putin's defender keeps a safe distance from him. He's left completely alone to level the score. It's good to be king. Kathryn ferguson academy would be closed. The young women of the school decided they were not having it. They started protesting and getting arrested. We started reporting on their fight to keep this very ambitious schooln and in june of last year, those girls and their founding principal won their fight. They kept the doors open. Them winning that fight last year means this is possible this year. Yesterday 24 young women suited up in white robes. They got their diplomas handed to them. All the of the graduates this week have applied for college. Congratulations class of 2012. You would not be here had you not fought for it. Best new thing in the world today. Definitely not the best hockey game but for pure authoritarian hue bris it's the best new thing. One of these otters is not like the otter otters is the best new thing in the world. Happy 100th birthday fenway park. You're the best new old thing in the world. Your new fanfare is the best thing tonight. This close encounter between a texter and nature. Oh, geez, best new thing in the world today. Especially the hair. You got my hair right because this is what my hair looks like. Best new thing in the world today. Liquor, liquor. Best new thing in the world today. Best new thing in the world. We've got more ahead. Stay with us. 

[00:53:47]


>>> One of the things I love best about what I do for a living is it's almost impossible to predict what is going to take off. People trying to make a particular thing take off don't always get their way. Sometimes some other force takes hold. It's especially true in a year like 2012. In the wake of important debate between the candidates and it ended up the topic that everybody was talking about was big bird after everything else, after the tens of hundreds of millions of dollars spent to make them talk about whatever they wanted them to talk about, the 2012 race was brought to you by the letter b. Things happen. Just as this show is brought to you by a huge number of hugely talented and hard working people who do you not see on camera but out whom I could not do what I do. The best staff in all of cable television works on this tv show. I don't know what I did to deserve it but I'm grateful for it. I'm mbled by their talent. I'm nothing without them. None of us wouldn't be here if you weren't here watching. From all of us here, thank you for watching this show. We love our jobs and you make it possible for us to have them. Happy new year. ???????????? ???????????? ???????????? ???????????? ???????????? ???????????? ???????????? ???????????? ???????????? ???????????? ????????????! ???????????? ???????????? ???????????? ???????????? ????????????

=======================================================

(chuckles) (yelps) Why, you little... (both groaning) Beneath this smile, I'm in awful, awful pain! (screaming) Welcome, precious primetime viewers, valued Internet downloaders, and scary digital pirates! If you want to shield your little darlings from our stomach-churning holiday special, simply hit fast-forward on your DVR remote... (distorted grunting) I went too far! Spoiled the whole show for everybody! I don't deserve to wield the remote. (shuddering): Oh, I'm getting old and gray... I'm dead. (spooky music plays) Monster go watch The Office. Dunder-Mifflin just like monster's workplace. 
??????   ??????
(grunting) (laser rifle fire) Milhouse, do we have enough points for a weapons upgrade? Yeah! We really racked them up eating all those elf babies. Ha-ha! Nothing beats a weapon made of weapons. This is that video game Reverend Lovejoy said you shouldn't play. Well, he'splaying it right now. Slay the wounded! I still think it's too violent. It's a game. We're not hurting anybody. My non-lazy eye! Ooh. These classic board games are fun andsafe. 

[00:02:02]


(grunting) My other eye! (sighs) So which of these "board lames" shall we play? Taffy Land? Drops and Risers? Consternation? Ravenous, Ravenous Rhinos? Mouse Catch? Battleboat? Funopoly? Crate of Apes? Yahtzu? Tiddlywonks? Hey, I've never seen this one before. Milhouse: Satan's Path? Hey, it's got to be good if Satan put his name on it. Huh? Here. I'll be the demon, you be the thimble. Oh, I'm always the thimble. One... (rumbling) (gasps) Two. Both: Ooh! (train whistle blows) (shouting) There was a bank error in my favor. And I'm spending it all on Oriental Avenue prostitutes! (gasps) Milhouse: All the games to life! (chattering) I don't like the looks of that knight, Chief. Don't worry. We're safe. He's two steps away, and one to the right. (groans) For me, it's game, set... and match. I think you mean "check, and mate." Just got crushed by a giant horse, Lou. You want to cut me a break? (romantic music plays) Time to meet my mystery dude. (chuckling) (sighs) Ah. (Homer grunting) Oh, man, I'm never coming down! Ah! Whoo-hoo! Another ladder! Riding high! Sinking low! Top of the heap! Oh! Down I go! On top for good! Oh, cruel hubris! 

[00:04:03]


How do we make this stop? Well, my Latin's a little rusty, but I think to get everything back in its box, you have to finish the game. And if we don't finish? You're going to have to deal with more nonsense like that. All: Yatszu. Here we go, back in the cup. At least the cup is lined with felt. Hey, Mr. Positive, shut the hell up. (roars) (monkey chattering) (buzzing) (chattering) (rumbling crash) We'll be safe on this Battleboat. Set a course for B-7. (motor humming) Powerful voice: B-7. Milhouse: They dunked our Battleboat! I wish I could see my mom one last time, so I can say, "This is all your fault!" Colonel Ketchup, I say it was you that killed him in the parlor, with the letter-opener! He was going to leave me, and I'm too old to find anyone else. (grumbles) Come on, man, climb up! No. I might sink the letter. And "Q" is just too valuable. That blank could be any letter we want. Maybe I'm just tired of living. (bubbles gurgling) The final challenge: Mousecatch. A game so lame, no one's ever finished it. (wild cackling and roaring) Crazy Eights! Think, Bart. Think! What was that lesson I learned from video games? Oh, yeah! Kill, kill, kill! (crying) There comes a time to beat the crap out of childish things. (wild raving) (groaning) (gasps) Sure is a hard way to catch a mouse. 

[00:06:07]


, this stupid thing never works. (grunts) That's it. From now on, we'll just play Hangman. Wait, wait. We still got one more letter. Is it... 3? (buzzer sounds) That's not a letter. Stupid, stupid, stupid!

plays) (gasps) (screams) Man, it's been a crazy morning. Champagne? Oh, Homie, what a great idea-- to take a cruise in uncharted waters. Yeah, charts are for squares, baby. (grunting) Whew. Sure is hot out here. Mmm. Mmm. (slide whistle tone) Oh, that's my cell phone. What is it? Lenny, I'm on a second honeymoon! You'll have to pick your own Lotto numbers. Now, where were we? (both giggling) Oh, baby, let's give those seagulls something to squawk about. (giggles) Huh? Oh yeah, baby, I like it when you're distracted. Huh? (oars splashing) (grunting) Homie, help him up. (sighs) Fine. I'll get the hook. Homer: Don't fight it. (man mumbling) Don't... That's it. A little more. How's that? (panting) You're safe now, my friend. This poor man must have been out there for days. He's nothing but hard, bronze muscle. (panting) Bless you. Okay, this guy's taken care of. So... uh, you know... I'm not really in the mood anymore. Fine. I'm going for a walk. (grumbles) (grumbles) (huffs) My name's Roger. I was the chef on the Albatross,working 

[00:11:11]


for a businessman taking his partners to Tahiti. One night, he asked for pie for dessert... As the pie cooled innocently on a porthole sill, my employer attempted to inject it with poison. But I caught him in the act. Unfortunately, he had the strength of ten businessmen. He sent me napward with a bottle of low-sodium soy sauce. Poor man. You've been through so much. Hey. I've had a hard trip, too. One of the lenses fell out of my sunglasses! Ah... oh, yeah... Oh, Roger, you really know what you're doing. (gasps) (radio static) No luck. Anyway, when I came to, everyone on board was dead. I fled the horrific scene. (squawks) And after days at sea, I found my savior. You, Marge. And, in a very insignificant way, you, Homer. God, it was horrible. Marge? Can I have a word with you in private? I don't trust that guy. I bet he killed everyone on that boat himself. That's crazy talk. Roger: Excuse me. You've both been so kind to me, I baked you this pie. That is so sweet. Why do piemakers get all the girls? Why did you do that? It was poisoned! No it wasn't! Well, it was rhubarb. No, it was berry-peach. HOMER: Berry-peach? That's my favorite! Please, Homer. I am so sick of this unmotivated jealous-- (screams) The pie was poisoned. You were right. I guess we've got to kill him before he kills us. Well, we'd better do it quick, because he's making scones! They should call this one "Recipe For Murder." What do you mean, "this one"? Never mind. 

[00:13:16]


Oh, Roger, would you hand me the suntan oil? (grunting suggestively) (spring popping zanily) Ooh, got a text. Now! (grunts) Dear God. We just killed a man. Yeah, the decent thing to do is bury him at sea. Come and get it, barnacles. Huh? (gasps) (both gasp) Roger wastelling the truth. This proves nothing. Roger could've been the one that killed them. Soy sauce. Low sodium. (gasps) Then his story wastrue. We killed an innocent man. We're murderers. Murderers! (sobbing) Roger: Well, if it isn't my saviors. (chuckles) Hey, pal, how you been? Don't you "pal" me. Why did you try to kill me?! The pie you baked us killed that shark! The pie was clean. The shark died from the fuel leaking out of your boat. It... Oh, yeah. Oops. Oh, goody. The monkey got ahold of a spear gun. (grunting) Why did you do that?! We had to kill him or he'd tell people we tried to kill him. What the devil's going on here? You're alive? Yes. I suspected our host would poison us, so I gave everyone an antidote before dinner. Looks like you've got a flair for avoiding death. 

[00:15:17]


(gun clicks empty) Oh, come on. Just a second. (grunting) (groans) Bankers away! (panting angrily) (pelican squawks) (shrieks, splashes) I repeat: No one will ever know. We'll know. Marge, what are you doing?! That pie is poisoned! (groans) I can't live with the guilt. (sighs) (sobbing) She just wanted to ride bikes through New England. But those seats hurt my ass. (sobbing) Ever wonder what she thinks about? Just sugarplums and buttercups. 

[00:17:50]


(suspenseful music plays) (thunder rumbles)

Hey, what's that weird look on all those girls' faces? It's something you've never seen: they're smitten. Oh, I've seen it. Especially when I do this. (groans) Well, he is cute. But I'm sure a boy like him would never say hello to me. Hello. (giggles) I love your pallor. (tires screeching) Why is there a steering wheel in my bedroom? (screams) (gasps) How'd you do that? Oh, it's these cheap school buses, with their squishy metal. On another subject, you ve beautiful eyes. (chuckles) They're just dots ircles. (bicycle bell rings) (gasping) (screaming) (screaming) (clown horns honking) What? Me again? (grunts) Come with me.

(gasps) You're a vampire. I should be scared, but I'm not. Let us move between the trees the way a bat does: by jumping. (giggles) Lisa's fallen for a vampire?

That makes me so angry! (straining): I feel the change coming! (howls weakly) Edmund's almost here, so, please, nobody be themselves. I know, I know. Don't segarlic, don't stab your guest in the heart with a wooden stake, don't ask him if he knows Frankenstein. It's racist somehow. (doorbell rings) Sorry, my Dad insisted on coming. Dad, I don't need a chaperone. I'm 400 years old. You live in my crypt, you play by my rules. You're tearing me apart! Dinner is served. I tried to make what Homer said you liked. I get the drumstick! (grunting) Okay, okay. If a mosquito bites you, does it become a vampire, too? Yes. Okay, okay. If you bite your tongue, does it become a vampire? Look, I'm more than just a vampire. I'm a nut for Dixieland jazz. (playing New Orleans jazz) (sighs) You said you weren't going to bring that. I said I mightnot.

(grunting) I'm Dracula, not The Hulk. Hyah! Hyah! (groaning) Bite me now, Edmund, and we'll both be vampires. Get your neck away from my son's teeth, you evil temptress. Sir, I'm not trying to take your son away from you. I plan to be a part of your rich culture, and organize media-friendly events to help combat all the unfair vampire stereotypes. Wow. Wow! Now I know what you see in this girl. Bite her, my son, and you both will be eight forever. Eight forever? Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. I can't spend eternity using kid scissors. They barely cut anything. (snarls) Too late! The bloodlust is upon me. (gasps) Back off, you unholy dreamboat! (yells) Pretty ironic-- a cross being used to kill someone. (sizzling) (screaming) Father, you're hurt. Yes, but at least you are safe, my son. Whoa, you blood-sucking freaks love your kids, too? I remember when he was a baby, I'd sneak up to his crib in the middle of the day to make sure he was still not breathing. (sobs softly) No...! Well, nobody loves his kids more than me! (grunts) Come and get it! (vampires grunting) Die, fatso! Uh-oh. His blood-- it's full of cholesterol. And not the good kind. (laughing) (groaning) Woo-hoo! Lisa: Uh, Dad? They turned you into a vampire.

=======================================================

R o has got the very latest and all of the updates on the fiscal cliff. Wolf? 
>>> Deb, thanks very much. Happening now, a fiscal cliff hanger. The senate bipartisan bill faces a very uncertain future in the republican-led house. 
>> Our speaker has said, when senate acts, we will have a vote in the house. That is what he said. That is what we he can be pekt. That is what the american people deserve. 
>> But is a sudden rift in the republican leadership putting it all in jeopardy? 
>> Also, we're breaking down the deal on the table right now. We're going to show you how it impacts view your bottom line. 
>>> And what about the secretary of state? Her dangerous blood clot. What could that mean for hillary clinton and her political future? I'm wolf itzer. You're in "the situation room." Right now we're following breaking news. All eyes are in the house of representatives where lawmakers are weighing the future of a bill that's now effectively a fiscal cliff fix. No vote has been scheduled on the bill that the senate passed in the middle of the night after steep tax cuts and spending cuts kicked in. Speaker john boehner has been trying to overcome some seriously stiff republican opposition. Our senior congressional correspoent dana bash is beginninging our coverage this hour. Dana, what's the very latest as far as republicans in the house, the majority are concerned? 
>> Reporter: The very latest, wolf, is that down this hallway is the house speaker's office. In that house right now are minutes of the hoe republican leadership having a discussion, what are they going to do? Are they going to have a vote tonight and more importantly, are they going to try to put this senate-passed bill on the house floor with an amendment. It was very clear in talking to many, many house republicans coming out of a meeting they had earlier this afternoon that there was a big desire to have an amendment with some spending cuts. In fact, I spoke with one of those republicans, steve la tour receipt. 

[00:02:20]


>> The speaker, to his dit, says we are famous for putting poison pills in pieces of legislation and they can say, that's a poison pill. He's asked that we be responsible and whatever the spending cuts are, that they either be something that the president himself has proposed in the past or the senate has embraced in the past and I think that's what you will see. 
>> Reporter: When you think about spending cuts, people might be wondering whether or not they are going to put something, an amendment on the floor which could be wide ranging. It seemses as if they do this, it will be targeted to put new spending cuts in to replace the sequester which is, of course, what the senate did for two month. So this is all very up in the air but it is clear that it is -- it is really fluid now and it's not a sure thing that this could get through the house right now with republican votes or democratic votes. It's just not sure. 
>> As far as I can tell, dana, and you're much closer to this than I am, if it was strictly up to the speaker of the house, john boehner, I think he would allow that senate-passed bill or pass 89 to 8, a lopsided bipartisan majority to simply come up for a vote. But he's got problems, including his number two, eric cantor, doesn't like, he can't support what the senate passed in such a lopsided vote and it looks like there's going to be a vote maybe tonight on new legislation which if it's passed by the house would then have to go back to the senate. 
>> Reporter: That's right. First of all, let's talk about your question about the house speaker. He, I am told by several people in this meeting today, was very intentionally did not give his opinion. He didn't say whether he supports or opposes this bill. Eric cantor did and he was certainly sending a signal to conservatives and making clear his personal position for good reasons. As the speaker goes, he really, I'm told, was told to just listen to concerns of the members. But it is true that if they do amend this, that it would have to go back to the senate down the hall here and it would have to be passed by thm or not. The other thing, just to sort of play this out a couple of days, there's a new congress sworn in on thursday, in just two days. If they don't finish this and send it to the president in the next two days, they are going to have to start all over again legislatively. One thing I will tell you is that in this meeting I'm also told it wasn't just concerns about spending cuts. There were a fair number of people, I'm told, who said let's not let the perfect be the enemy of the good and let's just do this and fight another fight down the road and many of those people had a lot of concerns about what happens tomorrow morning and overnight internationally. Here in the u.S. Tomorrow morning when the markets opens, there's a lot of talk about spooking when the market opens. 

[00:05:28]


>> Dana, as soon as you get more, let us now. The chairman of the house oversight committee, darrell issa, went to the floor to voice his concerns about the senate's fiscal cliff bill. 
>> When faced with a mountain of debt that we were heading for, like an airplane, did we climb over it? No. What we're going to do in the present plan is put nearly another trillion dollars worth of debt on the american people. 
>> So will the congressman vote for it? Congressman issa is joining us live from capitol hill. Congressman, thanks very much. If it just comes up the way it passes the senate, could you live with it? 
>> I think in its current form this opportunity, this once in a lifetime opportunity to do real spending cuts has to be seized. And for a good reason. They failed to meet their own stated obligation which was to bring us a balanced bill, one that had tax adjustment, yes, but also had spending cuts. This one fails at that and fails badly. 
>> So where are the spending cuts you will seek as part of an amendment to the senate-passed legislation? 
>> Well, the very first one we debated on the floor this morning. The $11 billion that would be saved by, among other things, not increasing the pay of members of congress. We certainly would like to see that one included. We believe the president's executive order throwing 11 billion in new spending on a few days ago was inappropriate, to say the least. Our committee has passed over $80 billion over a year worth of changes that we believe could be there. Some of them could be adopted in this package. Some of the tax extenders could be adjusted. As you know, wolf, there's a complex number of areas and if you can't find it and by the way if you're saying that less than two month from now or approximately two months from now we're going to be dealing with sequestration avoidance, you've failed to meet your requirement. This bill should take care of sequestration for at least a year and very clearly spell out what changes need to be paid for as part of a nearly $4 trillion tax cut. 

[00:07:45]


>> You realize, of course, congressman, if don't pass legislation, actual legislation that the senate passes between now and noon on thursday, millions of your constituents out there, all across the country, are going to see a significant tax increase, not just rich people making more than $400,000 a year, but middle class families will immediately start paying more. 
>> Well, as you know, wolf, starting january 1st the obama care tax increase kick cans in and speaker pelosi passed when she had the role under this president. But let's also remember that if WE GET IT RIGHT ON JANUARY 2nd, 3rd 4th OR 5th, WE WON'T Ultimately have these kick in. Technically the tacks have gone up. I would like to open with a resolution but if we don't sial that we're willing to cut this $1.3 trillion per year, the american people aren't getting a tax cut. They are getting a tax deferral. The money will still be owed. It will simply be next year or the next generation. Either way, I think we have to put a down payment, as the president said, on a real reduction, something he hasn't done with the senate in this bill. 
>> A lot of your constituents are going to hate you. They are going to hate your fellow republicans in the house of representatives if you don't allow new legislation to go forward and they are going to be paying a lot more in taxes. 
>> Wolf, I only have one voting card and I was instructed by my voters when I was re-elected to vote my conscience, to vote their best interest. Not for one day for the rest of their lives. The only way I can do my job is use my best judgment to make sure we're not passing on debts that we can't pay in the future. Dealing with social security, dealing with medicare, some of these things are complex and would take more time. But some of the spending cuts that have already been voted through the house that simply aren't in the senate bill could be dealt with in a matter of hours. And I think the senate knows that although they passed a bill on a very bipartisan basis, they didn't do the heavy lifting. The heavy lifting is adding additional spending cuts and sending it back over. My voters want a tax cut if they can have it but they want a tax cut that is real, not one that you don't pay today but owe it tomorrow. 

[00:10:12]


>> So it was an 89 majority, 89-8 vote, only 8 democrats and republicans in the house voted against it. Did not vote in the middle of the night. All of those 89, including all of the conservative republicans like pat toomey and others, they were wrong? 
>> You know, wolf frk I can't account for what happens after midnight and all of that partying and referee and dlinking that goes on at 2:00 in the morning. What I can tell you is they did half of a bill. Half of the bill is going to be popular certainly in the way of holding down taxes but the other half is there's no spending reductionses. As a matter of fact, there is additional spending. The president has backed this bill with items including tens and billions of dollars for unemployment extension, which is going to have to be paid for. Hurricane sandy relief, which is somewhere between 27 and $60 billion comes right behind it. That's newspaper new spending. The american people told us to deal with all of it. Sure, we'd like lower taxes but republicans realize's that a lower tax that is only temporary because ultimately you're only borrowing the money is not lower tax. It's a tax defrl. When speaker pelosi and democrats were in charge, they used the word pay go constantly. In other words, is there an offsetting pay for what you do? President bush's tax cuts were not paid for. They were anticipated to be grown out of. These are not anticipated to be grown out of. Cdo has said 3.967. In other words, $4 trillion will be added to the debt over ten years with this tax cut unless we do some spending cuts to help offset it. Right now the president's still in a spending mood. We need to get him in a savings mood. 
>> I want to clarify, you said it was after the new year's and they were partying. Are you suggesting that mitch McCONNELL AND FELLOW REPUBLICANS In the senate were drunk when she voted on this last night? 

[00:12:14]


>> Of course not. I was having a little fun with you, wolf. It was after midnight t was a piece of legislation intended to be passable. Not necessarily to be right. D this was in fact something that joe biden found a way to get the art of the possible. Send something to the senate that the house could consider. Now it's in the house. What we find missing from it sl any kind of reasonable spending reduction, something that the house has dealt with in committee. We've bubbled it up. We have a lot of figures. Quite frankly, the lack of sequestration, the idea that in two months, in addition to this, we'll be dealing with the cliff in defense and sequestration and the cliff in the sense that we don't raise the debt limit, i think they could easily be dealt with today. I'm with eric cantor. This bill in its present form is not good enough and the american people are smart enough to know that what you don't pay today and owe tomorrow, you'll have to pay tomorrow. 
>> We've got to go, congressman. You still have confidence in the speaker? 
>> I have confidence in the speaker. He's making the process open but of course that includes people like myself and leader cantor who say we have to be open to change. 
>> Darrell issa, thank you very much. 
>>> Much more and the white house reaction to this latest rift between the house speaker and the republican majority leader when it comes to the fiscal cliff bill. What's going on? 
>>> Plus. 
>> The latest on hillary clinton's blood clot. When she might be released from the hospital, what could it mean for her future. Lots of news happening right here right now in "the situation room." mommy having. Mommy's having a french fry. Yes she is, yes she is.

[00:16:32]


>>> We're following the breaking news here in washington. House republican leaders, they are meeting right now, they are trying to decide whether to vote on the senate's fiscal cliff bill that passed in a lopsided 89-8 majority in the middle of the night. Many republican lawmakers, though, have grave concerns about the lack of spending cuts in the senate-passed bill and they could decide to amend the measure, send it back to the house. Tom foreman is working this for us. Tom, how big of a complication would this be? 
>> This is massive, wolf. I can't even say how big it is. I'm standing inside of our virtual senate where last night a lot of people thought solutions were under way as they passed all of these different measures that would have something to do with the fiscal cliff but on the other side of the capitol, on the house side, dark clouds have been gathering all day long because there are some things that were passed here that the house republicans just hate and let me show you some examples. For example, there's one over here. If you look at this whole notion of the cap, we're where you're going to keep the bush tax cuts and where you're going to get rid of them. Ultimately they decided that they'd put it at 450,000 for couples and $400,000 for individuals. If you make less than that, you keep the bush tax cuts. If you make more than that, you pay more in taxes. Republicans say this is all about increasing taxes, not at all about controlling spending. What about this? Deductions. People who make more money, you're going to lose some of the deductions that you had before. You're going to have them capped. You're not going to be able to avoid the taxes. Once again, it's all about raising taxes and not about controlling spending. As congressman issa mentioned a few moments ago, even on the measures that are about spending, many of the house republicans think the senate went absolutely the wrong direction. Look at this. This was the measure that had to do with providing extended unemployment benefits for about two million americans out there. We know there are about 12 million who remain unemployed but some need extended unemployment insurance. That was approved for an additional year at price tag of I think about $30 billion overall. This is what house republicans are saying, hold on about, you cannot do this. They are saying, all you are doing is running up spending and charging the taxpayers even more to try to pay for it. The main complaint from the house is not that you can't do some of these things with taxes, maybe some of them oppose that outright but others are saying, if you're going to do that, you must have the second half of the equation. You must address spending. Everyone knew last night the senate wasn't really doing that, wolf, but the notion was that this was a step at a time deal. Maybe they could get this part done and then address spending a little further down the line maybe in a few weeks or a couple months. The house, however, seems to be slamming the brakes on that to some degree and many are saying that they can't take the deal unless they see right upfront where the spending cuts will be. We'll see how it shakes out, wolf. 

[00:19:55]


>> That's precisely what conservative republicans are saying right now. Thank you. Let's dig a little deeper right now with ryan lizza, he's the washington correspondent for "the new yorker" magazine. It looks like there's a battle going on between the speaker, john boehner, and the leader eric cantor, saying he he cannot not support this bill. I've been getting the impression from the last few days whark ever passed the senate if it passed in a lopsided majority, he would allow that oh to come up for an up or down vote in the house. 
>> The dynamics in place in 2011 when boehner was trying to come to an agreement when he had people like cantor and paul ryan on the right, it seems like be that dynamic has opened up again. Up until now, since the election, boehner and cantor have been like this. 
>> Right. 
>> Cantor stood on stage at the press conference the day after plan b failed and took responsibility for that failure. They were together in leadership agreeing on the path forward up until this moment. Cantor has come up against the deal and boehner is still trying to feel where the conference is. 
>> Let's say the house tonight comes up with legislation, the senate legislation but it includes an amendment for significant spending cuts. And it passes with a lopsided just republican majority, the democrats vote against it, the republicans vote in favor of it by and large. Then what? 
>> Well, senate democratic aides are telling us that they won't pass anything if it comes back from the house with additional amendments. That's the line that is being quietly being put out. I haven't seen any senior democratic senators come out and say that but if that holds, this whole thing false apart. 
>> There's going to be a whole new congress starting thursday at night so they start from scratch. In the meantime, the markets will open tomorrow. They are very worried about continuity, et cetera. 

[00:22:05]


>> This legislation expires thursday at noon. You might see some liberal democrats say forget about it. Republicans don't like that but they don't like that, for example. 
>> There are a lot of senate liberals that voted for it and didn't love it. And a lot of liberals are arguing that obama caved and they don't like the deal that he negotiated and they might say, you know what, we're already over the cliff. Let's wait for the new congress to get in the house. We'll start over. So this is pretty bad news if you think from the perspective of wanting a deal before thursday. 
>> If they start all over again, they could do it within a few days and my experience in washington, the longer you wait on a deal like, this the more complicated potentially you could get. 
>> They can't let us continue on the fiscal -- we've gone over the fiscal cliff. 
>> Unemployment could go from 7.75% to 7.95%. 
>> The white house tried to do a grand bargain with boehner and revenue piece that's been kicked back to the house and the house is saying, forget it, forget it, we want these spending cuts, too. So everyone has to be in a room negotiating this thing. 
>> Ryan, thank you. 
>>> The vice president joe biden has just weighed in on the confusion in the house of representatives. What is he saying? Stand by. Jessica yellin is over at the white house. 315 horsepower. What's that in reindeer-power?

[00:26:48]


>>> Breaking news, we're following house republicans expressing grave concern about the senate's fiscal cliff bill with the majority eric cantor saying flatly he does not support what the senate passed in the middle of the night 89-8. Clearly there seems to be significant problems and maybe a significant break between the house speaker john boehner and eric cantor. Let's bring in jessica yellin. I understand that we just heard from the vice president joe biden who has played an important role in putting this deal together. 
>> That's right, wolf. The vice president playing the role of the informal go-between, the negotiator with senate MAJORITY LEADER mitch McConnell being an informal commentator now. Well, the entire staff here at the white house has been watching, waiting and anxiously he anticipating word from the hill as this snag has arisen in the afternoon. Frankly here at the white house they sort of, I get the sense, for it to be on the way to resolution by now. Folks on the inside have been hungry. That mess is closed at the white house and the vice president took it on himself to go out and get some sandwiches and left the white house grounds and took a stroll across the street to pick up lunch for himself. I think we can play the video on his walk over to potbelly. Someone asked him a question. This is what he said. 
>> Mr. Vice president, are we going to avoid the fiscal cliff? What did you say? I'm sorry? 
>> I hope so. I think so. 
>> Reporter: I hope so. I think so. That was the vice president. He walked about 2 1/2 blocks from the white house and brought home -- I don't know if we have video of it, but he brought home sandwiches, it looks like three or four sandwiches for his entire staff. The challenge for the president is that the vice president had something of a relationship with eric cantor but not one that could overcome their philosophical differences on these issues. They don't have a move left to make in terms of getting the house gop to change its position right now. They really have to watch and wait to see what happens as the house decides what to do tonight, wolf. 

[00:29:21]


>> Whado officials at the white house expect to happen between now and tomorrow? Because the deadline is over by thursday at noon, that's when the new congress is sworn in. 
>> Reporter: Well, the way they put it, they are counting on the house to realize that this is the best option left, in their view, and fight on the tax -- sorry. Fight on the debt issue in the next fight because there's a debt ceiling fight left to come. If they cannot get a win out of this, if this deal collapses, there is two moves the white house will have. One, they are starting to rebuild the relationship with the business community and i would expect the white house to CALL ON CEOs TO PRESSURE Congress to either pass this bill now -- I wouldn't be surprised if they were calling CEOs NOW PRESSURING THEM TO PASS This or get something passed before thursday and if not that, then play the blame game because already someone has said to me inside, if this goes down, then house republicans have pushed us off the fiscal cliff. Now, we've fallen -- we're over the cliff but the blame is -- will be shiftedto republicans for permanently putting us there, wolf. 
>> That's going to be a huge, huge political impact. We'll see what happens. But the news right now from the house of representatives, very, very dramatic. Looks like they are not, at least the republicans, going to go along with the republican colleagues from the senate and pass this legislation as would have sent it to the president for a signature, they would have resolved it. Folks could have moved on but it doesn't look like that is happening right now. Jessica, thanks very much. 
>>> Could the latest standstill in the fiscal cliff come back to haunt republicans? We're talking about that in our strategy session. Lot of breaking news happening right here in "the situation room." claims. flo. I need you. I feel so alone. But you're not alone. I knew you'd come. Like I could stay away. You know I can't do this without you. You'll never have to. You're always there for me. Shh! I'll get you a rental car. I could also use an umbrella. Fall in love with progressive's claims service. 

[00:33:35]


>>> All right. We're following breaking news. Let's discuss what is going on in our strategy session. The democrat stick strategist, maria cordova and ross, who often writes from a conservative perspective. 
>> Now and again. 
>> What do you make of what is going on? A lot of republicans are telling me that they are worried if this whole deal collapses and millions see their tax rates go up, they are going to blam republicans. 
>> That seems pretty likely. I don't think there really is a clear argument for republicans in the house not passing the bill. What republicans are thinking, they look at the negotiations that have happened over the last 48 hours, they say, we got the president of the united states to break his campaign pledge on the $250,000 tax threshold, take it up to 4 had 00, 450,000 and we didn't make huge concessions. I mean we. They weren't in the room negotiating. So I think their theory is, we pushed, obama bent, let's ping-pong the bill back and let's see if they bend a little more. I think what that misses is an immense pressure, not democrats and republicans on the left that won't let them play ping-pong with the bill. 
>> Can the democrats accept the little pin right now in the next 24 hours? Let's say the house passes the senate version with one amendment that calls for specific additional spending cuts and it goes to the senate, be do you think that's doable? 
>> It depends on what those spending cuts are and I think that the leaders in the senate will look at it because I think the american people do deserve for leaders to be responsible and here's where I think the republicans are really going wrong on two front. This is so politically perilous for them. They lost the election in november because the american people didn't think that republicans understood what they are going through and if they are now the ones who are the architects of all of us going over the cliff and for millions of americans taxes to go up, that's going to be very bad news for them. The second thing is, if they think they are going to get a better deal, they better think again. Because if nothing happens and you've talked about this today and come thursday at night, there's going to be a new congress with, guess what, more democrat crass, more democrats, more levage.

>> Maybe they are thinking we can't get a better deal but if senate democrats were already willing to cave at 450,000, maybe they will cave if we go over the cliff, swear in a new congress, the house passes the bill with rates at 700,000, now I agree. 
>> That won't happen. 
>> The republicans in the house want. They are -- what they want is a lot more spending cuts. 
>> Right. 
>> They want to deal with entitlement spending, domestic spending, not defense spending but they want to deal with spending. Here's the question for both of you. How much trouble is john boehner in as the speaker of the house? 
>> I actually -- I actually don't think that john boehner is going to be in that much trouble this year. I don't think when his speakership comes up for a vote that he will be in trouble. I don't see anyone else lining up to take his job. >>Rhaps in the last few hours we may have seen -- 
>> I just interviewed darrell issa and he says that hwith eric cantor. 
>> So that might be changing but I do think that john boehner has certainly lost control of his caucus. But frankly, they might want a weak leader because then they think they can control him. 
>> It's the second poke in the eye. He had plan b and now the pressure a lot of people got from the meeting at the white house, boehner said, it's up to the senate. Let them pass something. If it's a bipartisanmajority, we'll bring it to the house and vote on it up or down. 
>> You were talking about the political damage republicans could sustain and there are about 50 or 60 republicans sitting thinking, yes, I'm really worried about the political damage from going over the cliff but there are a a larger number of republicans in safe seats who are worried about being primaried and who think that they need to worry about being stood up to pr obama. That's the problem. 

[00:38:09]


>> All of the democrats, all of the democrats are united in the house and they vote for the senate version which won't -- assuming how many republicans do you actually need to get to that 217? It's now 217 because there's an absent seat instead of 218. How many more reicans would you need? 
>> Probably not that many. 
>> What we're hearing is you have between 20 and 50 republicans on board and that would be enough. 
>> That would be enough? 
>> If I'm a house democrat, why would I do that? Okay, you could say for the good of the country at economy. 
>> You care about the cotry. 
>> But at a certain point, i think this is a situation where -- 
>> you're doing it to prevent hundreds and millions of americans from paying more in taxes. 
>> But they aren't going to pay more in tacks if we p spend a week fighting this out. And if he democrats are right about the political calculus, the democratic party has an incentive to fight this out for a week and the lonrm benefit for their party and theoretically for the party might be greater. Sometimes you need to let these fights play out, right? 
>> That may happen depending on what happens if they and mend this and it is the poison pill. The majority of our leaders in congress don't want to be the ones to make millions of americans pay more in taxes but what drives me nuts, wolf, about what republicans are complaining and saying that there's no spending cuts in it, they had so many opportunities to do a grand bargain with millions and millions of dollars of spending cuts. They couldn't get it together. So at the end of the day, we knew about a week ago that this deal was not going to include any spending cut. So for now for them to complain that this doesn't have any spending cuts for me is a way to drive a wedge into this z players plenty of blame to go around. The simpson/bowles, the recommendation that he accepted, that was a moment in history when they say he should have grabbed, looking. 
>> Look, I have to say, the lesson right now is that house republicans want to fight this out to the absolute bitter end and, you know, again sometimes there's something to be said. I know we like to talk a lot about the importance of bipartisanship but you get better outcomes from both parties if you let the fights play out. 

[00:40:23]


>> If you think this is a big fight, wait until the debt ceiling comes back. 
>> I think lessons in cliff lessons and rock climbing, because that's what we're going to be dealing with. 
>> A genital fiscal slope. 
>> Guys, thanks very much.

>>> News of a blood clot raising questions about her future right now. She was already expected to step aside as secretary of state but she's a leading presidential contender 2016 if she chooses to run again. So how will her current health crisis potentially impact her future? Cnn's mary snois joining us. What's the latest on her condition? 
>> Wolf frk we haven't heard from her doctors since they let us know that she was making excellent progress. An expert in blood clots said if unrelated the clots could be serious but the fact that it's being addressed is a good sign. On the day when sect hillary clinton was supposed to be getting ready to go back to work, she spent another day at the hospital. Doctors discovered a blood clot in the vein between the brain and skull behind the right ear. They say she did not suffer a stroke or neurological damage. A doctor not involved in secretary clinton's case has treated cases like hers and calls them rare. What does this mean for the future? 

[00:45:10]


>> I think her future is as good as her past. She should recover from this. Will be treated with blood thinners. I can't say how long because i don't know all of the circumstances but certainly minimum of three to six month, may well could be longer. In some rare cases, could be lifelong but manyatientsare on blood thinners for life. She should recover fully and get back to work. 
>> Reporter: And that work is grueling. Him clinton has traveled to more than 100 countries as sretary of state and logged close to one million miles during that time. While travel is something to watch out for among people who suffer blood clots, most in the leg veins which she had in the LATE 1990s, HE DOESN'T SEE HER Travel being an impediment. 
>> It's probably more with the blood clot she had in her leg 12 years ago. They are always at risk of developing another one and the risk is greater than if they never had a blood clot. I think travel is potential leanne issue for the secretary but I would imagine that when she travels she's not sitting in a coach seat cramped up and sitting still. 
>> Reporter: Secretary clinton is planning to step down as prest obama's second term begins. While she has repeatedly said she's not interested in running for president again, she is viewed as the democratic favorite in 2016 should she choose to run. Doctors familiar with these types of rare clots say it's unlikely that it developed as a side effect as clinton's recent concussion. Some speculate it could be linked to an underlying condition or to dehydration. Wolf?

>> Well, these are just exercises, wolf, but you're right, the key is where iran is firing these missiles. 17 pill general barrels travel through the strait of hormuz. That's in a very narrow waterway that iran has threatened to blockade before. Iran started the new year showing off new technology, including an upgraded missile designed to destroy missiles. Helicopters, fighters and drones. 
>> This tells me more about their willingness to keep the pressure up, stay in a somewhat ed and confrontational mode. 
>> The test didn't dramatically move the ball for iran's technology but it sends a warning to the nations in the region regarding any attempted strike on iran's nuclear facility. 
>> Short term they may actually like the idea telling us that they can escalate, to make us think it's not just a pinprick strike but the beginning of a war and may feel that they can whether it's the united states, qatar or kuwait. 
>> Iran's missiles were becoming more accurate, more versatile and more deadly than ever. But for years u.S. Intelligence officials circled the year 2015. They believe by then iran could test an intercontinental interballistic missile with a range of 3500 miles. 

[00:52:05]


>> This would give them the ability to attack a number of european countries and give them political influence in a crisis that they might otherwise not have. 
>> But the latest report from congress was released in the last few weeks. It reand setses that estimate and concludes iran is not likely to test an icbm in the next few years. So why is that? The report says that economic sanks are making it harder and harder for iran to acquire the political component and materials that they need. And the iranians are not getting the help they need from russia and china who whose support has been dropping over the past ten years, wolf.

>> You cannot buy marijuana from the club. But you can come in here, you can share marijuana or bring in marijuana.

And hillary clinton is being treated with blood thinners for a dangerous clot in her head. I'll speak with a vascular surgeon with the risks that she faces. We want to welcome our viewers in the united states and around the world. I'm wolf blitzer and you're in "the situation room." As the old saying goes, it ain't over until it's over. The fiscal cliff deal approvaled overwhelmingly faces strong opposition by house republicans. In fact, the numbetwo house republican leader says he does not support it and now a new deadline threatens to send it back to the drawing board. And dana bash is on capitol hill. Dana, what is the latest as far as the republican majority in the house is concerned? 
>> Reporter: The latest, wolf, is that republicans will reconvene and have a second meeting in 15 minutes. Down this hall, house republican leaders are still huddling but they announced that they are going to call republicans back toge perhaps that is because they have an idea of the the game plan that they want to pursue after they heard for about an hour and a half this afternoon from their rank and file by all accounts there certainly is a lot of interpret pi dags and voting to simply approve what the senate passed last night not only overwhelmingly, 90% of the senate voted for it, but it passed overwhelmingly among the fellow republicans. Again, the percentage is about 90% of senate republicans voted in favor of this plan to effectively make sure that as you saw in many press releases, 99% of americans keep their tax cuts in place. They don't see a tax increase. So that's the latest of what happens in thatin meeting. I talked to some republicans who say that they still believe it's possible that they can vote tonight and wh seems to be the open question is whether or not the vote will be on the bill that the senate passes and also on an amendment to answer some of the house republican concerns, the biggest of which is that there aren't enough spending cuts or perhaps the cuts that they have in there aren't the appropriate kind. Some call them game mix. Maybe that's something that they will try to tweak. And then it becomes the question, what happens? If they tweak something or change something, it's going to have to go back to the senate and leaders don't seem to be in a mood to bring their people back to change something that 90% of their members voted on. 

[01:03:13]


>> Are they even in town? A lot of them have left washington, d.C., Assuming this whole thing had been resolved. 
>> Reporter: You know, they are actually going to have to be here in two days because the new congress is going to be sworn in on thursday. My understanding is that there was some kind of quiet talk about people not going too far. Primarily for that reason but regardless it doesn't seem to be in their desire right now, let's put it that way, to bring them back. In fact, one democratic source said we're not going to sit around and wait because these republicans can't take yes for an answer. As you can imagine, there's a lot of animosity going on right now. 
>> And if there's no resolution by thursday, that's when the new senate and new house are both sworn in, the 113th congress. They start from scratch. The bills passed in the last few days, they can come up again but they basically have to start at the beginning and come up with a new plan because there will be new members at the house and the senate. 
>> Exactly. 
>> Dana, don't go too far away. The white house tried to pull out all stops. They managed to do that but can they save the agreement as it appears to be floundering in the house of representatives. Let's bring in jessica yellin. So what's the thinking over at the white house, jessica? 
>> Reporter: Well, clearly, wolf, they are mystified and the general sense is there is no love losts, as we well known, between this end of pennsylvania avenue and the leadership in the house republican conference. But they feel that body never fails to snatch defeat near the jaws of victory and that it could be happening again. There's a sense that democrats in general have been very confident and pleased with where the deal has been and they have not wanted to crow about it too much today for fear that that would alienate republicans or in some way tank the deal or sour it or in any way jinx it and it was going to happen today, and then it would be done and now the momentum seems to be shifting. There is not a lot of white house can do. The president does not have a relationship with speaker boehner. Doesn't have really one with eric cantor to make much of an effect there. And they sort of have to watch and wait. If it were on the floor, everybody here was saying they believe it will pass with the democratic votes. They know they have the votes to do that but at this point they are shrugging their shoulders. Wolf, if it goes down for any reason, there's no question that the political guns will come out. That the house republicans will take enormous heat for, quote, sending the nation over the fiscal cliff and it will be a wrenching battle from here to the debt fight. You can count on that. 

[01:06:24]


>> We know, jess sa, the president came out and spoke yesterday asking the senate to pass it and the senate did, including the house republican LEADER mitch McConnell all supporting it. 
>> Reporter: No, not that I've been made aware of and I don't think he would. Yesterday's speech was directed at democrats. As you remember, his speech did not go over well with republicans and the last thing the white house would want now is for the president to do anything that could turn the blame on to the president for this deal going south. Right now it's allclearly on the republicans and so he does not need to take the heat in any way. So I do not, pekt to see the president unless and until a bill goes to the floor, wolf. 
>> Jessica, stay in touch with us because we want to know what's going on, obviously. Thank you. 
>>> As house republicans are quick to point out, there's a lot that dmake it into the fiscal cliff bill and even if this works out, other potentl battles lie ahead. Cnn's tom foreman is joining us with a closer look at those battles. What are you seeing, tom? 
>> In the last hour we were looking at all of the things that the house republicans just hate, especially the budget hawks there. Look out on the floor here. Look at all of the different measures included here. If you look at this and you're a house republican who is very concerned about the budget, your fundamental complaint is that you see a lot of tax increases out here and almost no controls on spending which they think have to be part of the deal. But it goes beyond the deal that the senate approved last night. There are other measures still looming that those house republicans are concerned about. First up on the list, the debt ceiling. We hit our borrowing limit with the federal government here. We can only borrow so much money as thourzed by congress. Think about it like your cred card company. If you want to borrow more, you have to ask for more. Money can be shifted around for a couple of month. By late february, however, we're going to have to have this fight over the debt ceiling again and many of the budget hawks were already braced for that without this priming the pump. Beyond that, what about the payroll tax cut in this was a 2% cut in your payroll tacks last year. Almost every american enjoyed this. It took down their social security taxes, put a few extra dollars in their pockets. That expired at the end of last year, at thend of 2012. So many republicans are not necessarily thrilled oifr thatway because they could say that is a tax increase on the middle class. Really it's not but certainly it's going to feel that way to a lot of people. What about the begin one? Sequestration. Remember, that's a long fancy world for a deal that both parties agreed to. They both said if they could not settle their budget differences by the end of 2012, there would be an automatic 10% cut on federal spending across all agencies. Now as part of this senate deal, they've pushed that a couple more months down the road. That's another reason that the budget hawks and republican party are having a fit right now because they are saying in every way they think that this measure is about delaying all the pain and spending money now when spending, they think, has been 

[01:10:08]


the problem all along: Wolf? 
>> Good explanation, tom, in our virtual senate watching what is going on. Thank you. 
>>> The fiscal deal passed by the senate is now stalled in the house of representatives. Is there room for further compromise? I'll speak about that and more with debbie wasserman schultz. She's also a congresswoman from florida. You see her there. She's standing by live.

>>> The senate compromise on the fiscal cliff was hard fought but passed overwhelmingly 89-8. The house republicans have put the deal in limbo. I spoke with republican congressman darrell issa in our last hour. 
>> I'm with eric cantor. I can't vote for it in its current form and for good reason. They failed to meet their obligation. Their own stated oblation which was to bring us a balanced bill. 
>> Let's discuss what is going on with chair representative debbie wasserman schultz of florida. Congresswoman, thank you for joining us. 
>> Hi, wolf. 
>> Are you opened to amendments of what passed last night? 
>> I'm sorry. I missed that. I had someone else in my ear. 
>> Are you opened to amendments to what passed the senate last night? 
>> No. Because what this agreement was, be when the vice president and mitch McConnell went into negotiations over the weekend, the deal was, and speaker boehner agreed to this, whatever they came up with, especially if it passed overwhelmingly, that there would be a straight up or down vote on the house floor. This is just unbelievable. It's understandable. Okay. Some republicans, maybe many republicans that don't support it. We have angst in our caucus, too. There should be an up or down vote. The republicans and democrats willing to vote for it should be combined and we'll see whether it passes. But to play game with whether tax rates go up, taxes go up on 98% of americans. Look at what they are walking away from, potentially, wolf. This is a bill that prevents 98% of americans from having their taxes go up. It's a bill that prevents middle class taxes going up and it's a bill that makes sure we have a balanced approach. We have an extension of the american opportunity tax credit and the earned income tax credit and an extension of the child opportunity tax credit. Are these things that the republicans actually want to allow to lapse? Because that's what would happen. It would be devastating to the middle class. If they had republicans in their conference that won't vote for the bill, fine. We have democrats that probably won't vote for it either. But the bill needs a vote up or down on the house floor. 

[01:15:28]


>> Did the speak are of the house john boehner agree that anything that passed with did divisive opportunity in the senateuld come up without any opportunity for amendment and sit down and negotiation well mitch McConnell. I'm sure he believed that he was negotiating on behalf of john boehner and not that there's a guarantee that republicans are going to support it. And passes the senate 89-8. And conservative moderate and progressive support and it needs to have a straight up or down vote on the house floor. We need to stop playing games and make sure that we stop jeopardizing the tax rates of the middle class where if we don't pass this bill or if we certainly don't take a vote on it, then 98% of americans are going to see a tax increase. That's from the republicans. 
>> What happen if there's no deal that the senate legislation, what happens then? What happens to tax rates in other words, how much time will there snb. 
>> I think it's very clear. If there are no deal. If they try to amendment this bill and send it back and it means we are going over the cliff. Taxes increase on everyone regardless of income. If that's what the republicans want, it's a little baffling. We need to make sure that as we go through -- this is step one. Down the road in two month when we deal with the sequester, the significant defense and domestic spending cuts, we need to make sure we address deficit reduction with a balanced approach to -- with revenue and spending cuts. But none of these solutions should be allowed to be balanced on the backs of the middle class and the republicans seem to think it's okay. That's what they are risking. It's incomprehensible, actually. 

[01:17:59]


>> How many of of your fellow democrats -- let's assume the senate bill comes up. 
>> Right. Not a member of congress, a labor secretary during the clinton administration, listen to what he told me yesterday. 
>> I think no deal is actually better than a bad deal. I would go over the fiscal cliff and then I would introduce legislation to provide a middle class tax cut and restore a lot of the spending cuts and the republicans would have to go along with it. I don't want to make the bush tax cut permanent up to $48450,000 and also I want the republicans to make a deal on the debt selling. 
>> How many members of what you call the progressive caucus in the house are with him saying no deal or this deal? 
>> No deal is perfect. There are things I don't like in the deal. I'll give you an example. With the medicare reimbursement rate, the pay fors. At the end of the day I know that I don't want taxes to go up on 98% of americans and 97% of small business owners. I know that we need to make a down payment on the beginning of a balanced approach to deficit reduction. I certainly know that we should -- that the american people spoke on election day and said that they are comfortable with letting tax rates rise for the wealthiest 2% of americans. Really? The republicans are going to oppose a bill for people who make taxes that make more than $450,000 a year? I represent a fairly upper middle class district. Folks at home are not ringing my phone off the hook saying, don't vote for this because they know that we've got to do something. They know that we've got to make a down payment on deficit reduction. They know that we've got to protect the middle class and we've got to focus on -- let's -- what I haven't heard about in a couple of days are, our needs get ba to the number one issues. Creating jobs and getting this economy turned around. This is one of the first things that we have to do so we can move on aggressively towards that. 

[01:20:12]


>> Bottom line, house republicans are meeting right now. They've just started a second meeting of the day. What do you anticipate will happen tonight? 
>> You know, I said earlier today, predicting what this group of republican and the house members will do is it certainly a challenge. I know that if -- from working with them as many years as i have, I know there are enough responsible republicans that there would be enough democrats and republicans that would pass that bill and send it to the president so we can prevent 98% of americans from having their tacks increased and we could get a handle on the deficit reduction problem. 
>> You think there's a disagreement between john boehner and eric cantor? 
>> You know, I don't know the internal workings of the republican leadership. It's hard for mcharacterize what this is. I know that they have tea partyiers in their conference that are separated from the reality, from the reality that most americans want us to work together and stop with the my way or the highway politics. Wolf, I have to go home. I represent a liberal district. I'm going to have to dp fend it to my liberal constituents like I did when I voted for the debt ceiling deal that included a trillion dollars of only a spending cuts with no revenue at l. I have to go back and defend that as did my of my fellow democrat. Republicans need to gather up their courage. They need to do what's right, strengthen their spines and come together and work with us so they can protect the middle class and move on. 
>> One final question. 
>> Sure. 
>> Marco rubio, your senator from florida, he was one of eight senators who voted again the deal last night. What does that say to you?

>>> And no one was hurt by spirit airlines had a bit of a rocky end to 2012. A flight from atlanta to ft. Lauderdale, it flipped the tail of a parked plane with its wing tip. The u.S. Airways plane, though, also an airbus, is now grounded.

>> Congratulations to the newlyweds. Thanks very much. 
>>> What lies ahead for hillary clinton? She's being treated for a dangerous blood cloth. 

[01:30:59]


>> Hillary clinton remains in a new york city hospital being treated with blood thinners to dissolve a clot in her head. Her doctors say they are confident thetary will make a full recovery but it is a dangerous condition. Joininus now is dr. David deaton, a vascular surgeon at georgetown university hospital. Doctor, thanks very much for coming in. We know the best-case scenario is she gets out of there in a few days, resumes her lifestyle. What's the worst case scenario? 
>> Well, the worst case scenario for all of us is death. 
>> What do you mean when you say death? This is a life-threatening disease potentially? 
>> I'm referring to worst case. But in this case, it doesn't seem like therereally is a bad case scenario because she doesn't seem to be presented with any neurological symptoms. This was a finding made on an imaging study which is different than if you are presented with neurological conditions. 
>> She is taking medication to deal with the clot. I understand that the medication, and correct me if I'm wrong, it doesn't necessarily directly make the blood clot go away but prevents it from getting bigger? 
>> That's correct. There's a class of drug that we use to actively break up clots but your body's own physiology has a way to break up clots and the medication that she is receiving coagulates the body. 
>> The worst case, if god for bit it went into her brain, then you've got major problems, neurological problems, potentially a stroke. You've got to monitor it pretty closely. How do you do that? 
>> Remember, this is in t veinus system. That's the primary complication from blood thinners or anti-coagulants. 

[01:33:01]


>> Do they all work on the same way with every individual or does every individual have a sort of dna that works in a different way? 
>> Well, that's the art of treating people with thrombotic problems, is that we are all different and that we have different background. The medication has to be regulated in a very different way based on the individual basis. 
>> Do we know if this blood clot started -- I assumed desome people thought I was wrong, i assumed it started as a result of the head injury she suffered. She had a bad flu. She was dehydrated. She fainted, she fell, and she got a concussion and I assumed the concussion can ledo this blood clot but other people are saying now maybe themach virus and dehydration led to the blood clot. In your experience, what would be the more logical cause of this blood clot? 
>> There's not usually a way to pin a cause and effect on a blood clot but certainly dehydration, any inflammatory state, any trauma such as a fall all can be contributing factors to a blood clot, including an under lying predisposition to blood clots. 
>> I know blood clots in the leg, the deep vein thrombosis that killed my friend david bloom during the war in iraq, he was in a sedentary sitting position inside an armored vehicle and she's on the plane a lot. She's got a little cabin there, can can move around a lot. She's not in a coach seat. 
>> Well, it's anous health problem in the united states. 5 to $8 billion are spent on dealing with that problem. But it occurs because of dehydration. It's a come pli nation -- 
>> meaning -- 
>> just not moving. We depend on the muscles in our legs to push the muscles back in our heart. If we don't, the blood pools there and it's a classic setup. 

[01:35:05]


>> Let's talk about recommendations to our viewers. They don't want blood clots in the legs, lungs, head, anyplace. What advice do you have for people watching right now? 
>> The classic situation and you may not get up and move around and that air has no humidity and you get to hydrate it particularly on longer flights. 
>> So you should drink a lot of fluid, even if it means getting up and going to the bathroom? 
>> Whether they are riding in a car, military vehicle, and david bloom's case or an airplane. But generally speaking inot an enormous problem. Just move your leg muscles. 
>> Make sure you're not dehydrated, move around a little bit and those are the best reasons -- 
>> right. When your legs are in the position, you need to move your legs around a little bit. 
>> Bottom line, is your upbeat, you're encouraged by the statement that hillary clion's doctors put out when they said secretary is making excellent progress, we are confident she will make a full recovery, that sounds good to you? 
>> Everything we've been told leads us to believe she will have a full recovery with no problems or resulting from this event. 
>> Because she did have a history of that one blood clot behind her knee years ago? 
>> Yes, she will probably need to have a workup. If she has a predisposition to blood clots which a number of people in the u.S. Have. It's not an uncommon condition and that changes the strategy for long-term therapy. 
>> Doctor, thanks very much for coming in. 
>> Absolutely. 
>> Appreciate your expertise. Don't leave yet. 
>> So here's a question. The world -- the health of a another world leader. The venezuelas are ushers in the world quietly on word that hugo chavez is suffering new complications from recent cancer surgery in cuba. Rafael romo is joining us. What are you hearing about chavez's condition? 

[01:37:16]


>> Wolf, venezuela officials are not being very specific about what the new complications are but say that the process of treating him is not without risks. So instead of ringing in the new year, they asked people to pray for chavez. A call for all toll pray for president chavez. We know that our prayers are accompanng hugo chavez. That's what he wants. He wants joy and optimism for the reality he's been fighting for. 
>> Reporter: There were masses held for the president recovering from cancer surgery. Traditional new year's celebrations and concerts to give people an opportunity to join the national call for prayer. It's a prayer, a universal love and planetary feeling for a good man, for a pat, and somebody who gives of himself to his people. The mood has been somber among his supporters, especially speaking from havana on sunday, chavez's condition is delicate. 
>> Translator: We were informed of new complications arising as a complication of respiratory infection. 
>> Reporter: Rumors of his failing health have spread like wildfire. He has sought to put an end to the frenzy on his twitter account he wrote, my fellow patriots, do not believe an ill-intentioned rumors. President chavez has spent the day calm and stable with his children next to him. The government has yet to inform the venezuela people what kind of cancer chavez is suffering from. 
>> Chavez has wanted to keep this is a secret. He's succeeded in that and has been able to do that because he got treatment in cubaand the cubans are very good at keeping secrets and that was for him a high priority. 

[01:39:17]


>> Chavez has not been seen in public and on prior occasions the socialist leader has not made any phone calls to state media to let people know about his medical condition. And before leaving for cuba, chavez left in all governing affairs. Chavez is supposed to be inaugurated into a new term on january 10th but there's no indication yet from the government whether he'll be able to physically able to attend his own swearing in ceremony. Wolf? 
>> What if chavez doesn't make the swearing in ceremony? What happens? 
>> It is a very important question, wolf. Essentially he would have to name or his vice president currently would have to take over between the time right now and then. If he doesn't make it, then the president of the national assembly would have to call for elections won 30 days like any president but we may be looking at a constitutional crisis, wolf, because chavez's supporters say they will not accept any other president for venezuela. 
>>> And north korea's young new president making a gesture for the new year. Is he also making a similar gesture towards south korea? america. We don't let frequent heartburn come between us and what we love. So if you're one of them people who gets heartburn and then treats day after day... Block the acid with prilosec otc and don't get heartburn in the first pl 

[01:41:44]


[ Male Announcer ] ONE PILL EACH MORNING. 24 hours. Zero heartburn. 
>>> Perhaps a new tone from north korea's young new leader. He goes public with a call for ending confrontation. What does he really mean? Brian todd has been looking into this. Lots at stake. 

[01:43:45]


>> Not sure if he really means all this. We've heard these calls before from north korea. The fact that kim jong-uns making a gesture towards south korea after the rocket launch and other recent tensions may signal a new approach. Happy new year from a novice young dictator. With public appearances and speeches like this one to ring in 2013. A stark change from his father who never once made a televised speech just issued a new statement for new year's. Kim jong-un calling for an end to confrontation. He also made no mention of nuclear weapons and focused on economic process. He did vow to strengthen north korea's military. And praised country's controversial long-range rocket launch last month. The other thing is, it really praises the military and it's hard to have a reformed omy. More resources are going into the military and better relations for south korea. That's why a trifecta doesn't added a up. 
>> Behind the scenes to strengthen his hand with the military. 
>> He has purged a number of officials including the very senior-most military officials. Unclear whether that means it's a weak and embattled kim jong-un or a very confident firmly in control kim jong-un who can help the generals from the power. 
>> And the personal history between his family and it's a history of tension. Cold war conflict and even assassination attempts which makes kim jong-un's latest gesture all the more bizarre. 

[01:45:47]


>> The late president wants to reach out to north korea and pursue better relations. That's despite the fact that north korea under kim jong-un's grandfather tried to assassinate her father twice, one such attempt killing her mother. 
>> There are two generations with respective families but park is a pragmatist and i believe she will get on with improving relayings with north korea. 
>> North korea was calling her a fascist throughout her campaign but maybe a step is better than no step at all. 
>> He did not say if he was going to introduce reforms except to say that technology is the foundation. He also didn't give details on possibly stepping up agricultural and industrial output, which as you know from being there, that's what they he is ditly need. They are a starving country. 
>> Maybe he's going to start something new. 
>>> The syrians living january 1st is another day of violence and officials report more than 120 people were found dead just today. Syrian refugees living along a camp in the turkish border is another day of survival. 
>> Translator: Life is okay. Thank god. May god give everyone long life. He protects us from bashar the donkey. We are walking slowly. We are carrying herbs. It's delicious. God's gifts are plentiful. 

[01:48:15]


>> I must help these people. Where is america? Assad must go. Must go. Assad is killing these people. 
>> We are picking herbs. Bar shar assad made us refugees. He killed two of my children. They destroyed our homes. I wish the world happy new year's and I hope by that time bashar assad will be gone and hope that we can go back to our children to our country to our families. 
>> Translator: His birth was delayed. He has a neurological disease. Here the doctors give us hope and that he will walk. What do you likeo draw? 
>> Translator: I everybody a happy new year. May god bless the rebels and save them and may god save my child, who's a rebel. 
>> Joe duran, our photographer, put that together. If you would like to donate to syrian relief efforts cnn.Com/impact. You'll find a full list of relief organizations, making a difference. You can impact your world. 

[01:50:19]


>>> So how will the world's financial markets look at the struggle to finalize a fiscal cliff deal? Cnn's richard quest is next. power down your little word game. I think your friends will understand. Oh no, it's actually my GEICO app...see? ...I just uh paid my bill. Did you really? From the plane? Yeah, I can manage my policy, get roadside assistance, pretty much access GEICO 24/7. Sounds a little too good to be true sir. I'll believe that when pigs fly. OK, did she seriously just say that? GEICO. Just click away with our free mobile app. 

[01:53:19]


>>> Financial markets wer closed for the new year holiday, but they'll start opening in just a couple of hours in asia, followed by europe and then of course wall street. Here's cnn's richard quest with a closer look at how the markets will view the effort to try to finalize this fiscal cliff deal. 
>> Wolf, borrowed time at best. That's how the markets will probably react to the fiscal cliff deal. Yes, to be sure, the worst effects have been put off, but only for a while. There's still those spendin cuts. They've been kicked down the road by two months. There's the $16.4 trillion debt ceiling, which has to be raised. That's been kicked off a couple of months. And then you've got the appropriations, the whole budget process, which will come back before the spring is over. So time and again, the markets in europe are saying we've seen how difficult it is to do these deals. Look at what happened with greece, with bailouts, with sovereign debt crises, with the euro zone. It was only at the very last possible minute that compromise was reached, that the big bargain was done. And if you look at the united states, even at a time of, a moment when really both sides needed to do more than the minimum, the markets will be saying they failed to do so. So, yes, they will be relieved, there won't be any immediate reaction, but the markets are certainly putting the politicians on notice that the budget mayhem can't continue. Wolf? 
>> Good notice. Richard, thank you. 
>>> Off an island in alaska right now, a crippled oil rig is running aground. It's carrying diesel fuel, oil, and hydraulic fluid, and the weather is working against recovery. WE'LL HAVE AN UPDATE.9??s# ??q 

[01:57:58]


>>> An oil drilling barge is grounded off an island in southern alaska and a fares storm is hindering recovery efforts onboard. Diesel fuel, lube oil, and hydraulic fuel. No leaks have been detected and teams are assembling to tackle any environmental damage. Cnn's paul vercammon has an update. 
>> Reporter: High winds and huge waves pounded the drilling rig off kodiak as it was being towed. The coast guard evacuated it over the weekend. Three crew members suffered minor injuries on shell support vessels. 
>> This guy just below the cabin. 
>> About ten seconds out until the next swell. 
>> Coast guard companies report it's grounded on an uninhabited island after being set adrift late monday night. They said the crew of the tug boat alert was ordered to cut loose the cullic for their safety in extreme weather. The evacuation and grounding of the cullic comes after sharp criticism from environmental groups and some eskimo leaders that shell's exploratory drilling in the arctic is too risky. The mayor of point hope in the arctic circle expressing concerns to cnn this summer. 
>> Look at "exxon valdez," look at the gulf of mexico, look at all the different things. Yeah, they said nothing would happen. You know, anything can happen. 
>> Shell says it won't begin actually extracting oil for at least a decade, not with exploratory rigs like the cullic, but with cutting edge super structures built to withstand the harshest conditions. The kulluk is not filled with oil for sale, but officials say the now grounded kulluk does have about 150,000 gallons of fuel on board, mostly diesel, for operating machinery. The officials say no sheen has been seen, suggesting the kulluk has not leaked fuel. But eskimo activist carolyn canon, one of shell's toughest critics, says she fears there will be a diesel spill from the kulluk that could harm sea an wildlife. 

[02:00:02]


>> It's a scary thought, because people rely on that food. 
>>> Happening now, breaking news. The senate's fiscal cliff fix is facing an uncertain future in the house, exposing a riff between republican leaders. We're watching world markets for reaction this hour. Will all the uncertainty sends stocks into a nosedive? And questions about hillary clinton's future. What her blood clot could mean for a possible white house bid. 
>>> I'm wolf blitzer, you're in "the situation room." 
>>> We're following breaking news on capitol hill. House republicans meeting for the second time today. They're trying to decide what to do with the so-called fiscal cliff bill, passed by the senate in the early hours of the new year. You can see the majority leader, eric cantor, and the speaker, john boehner. They're walking in a meeting together, but they apparently are divided when it comes to the bill, with kantor saying flatly, he won't vote for it. House republicans could decide to amend it. That would certainly only complicate matters, possibly even put a deal further out of reach. Our senior congressional correspondent, dana bash, has been following the breaking news for us. She's beginning our coverage this hour. What's the very latest you're hearing about the fate of what the senate passed last night? 
>> The latest is that house republicans are still in this meeting, as you said, the second of the day. And the house rules chair, who is in charge of making sure that things go on to the floor, is probably the easiest way to say it, he just told me that there will be a series of votes soon, not on the fiscal cliff, but here's why that's interesting. It's because leaders, whoever they are, when they run the house, tend to use that time to whip votes, to try to see where the votes are on a particular issue, because all the members are on the floor. So it may be that that will be a time when they're going to try to really gauge, beyond just this meeting, where they're talking at each other, but where they can really have face to face, mano y mano discussions about where this caucus is on votes, where it is just generally on the senate bill, or where it is, what we've been talking about, what many house republicans want, which i perhaps an amendment to add some spending cuts to this, because they don't believe that there are enough spending cuts or maybe the right kind of spending cuts. So that's what we're going to be watching over the next hour or so, to see what happens after we come out of that next meeting. But I've gotten strong indications that the house speaker gets it. He understands that if the house somehow drops the ball on this, whether it is deciding not to vote today and the markets open tomorrow and the markets tank, or votes and amends this in a way that the senate just says, we're not touching it, and the market tanks, house republicans will get blamed, blamed in a very big way, in a way that could affect the economy in an adverse way, to say the least. So he's trying to corral this very difficult caucus, which he's been trying to do for two years, to figure out the best way to make sure that they understand that he's hearing their complaints and their concerns, but at the same time, doing what he and other leaders clearly think needs to be done, to make sure that the economy is in the right place, that people's taxes, at least for the most part, are in the right place, and so on. 

[02:03:23]


>> The minority leader, the democratic leader, nancy pelosi, she tweeted about that so-called up or down vote in the house. Namely whether or not the house would take up the senate measure that passed in the middle of the night, if it were to come up, and that's a huge if, dana, if the senate legislation, as is, without any amendments, were to come up for a vote in the house of representatives, would it pass? 
>> I was talking to a democratic -- a member of the democratic leadership who said that they have probably about 150 members. So you wouldn't need that many republicans given how big their caucus is, in order to get the votes to pass it. So I think it's safe to say that it is likely that it would pass, but as you know, and as nancy pelosi knows very well, because she ran the house for four years, that is one of the big benefits of being in the house majority. They decide what goes to the floor for the most part, and they decide how it goes to the floor. And as we've been talking about, a big issue, politically, for the house speaker isn't necessarily whether to bring this up, but how to bring it up and make sure that his own members understand that he gets their concerns. Because if he just put this on the floor and said, okay, there's a vote, and didn't give members a chance to talk about the issues that they have and to talk about -- to voice their problems, then he would have a very big political problem on his hands. And by the way, it's just two days before there is an election for him to become the house speaker. Again, he's got to be voted house speaker again in the new congress. 
>> And that's a question as well. Let's say the house of representatives tonight or tomorrow morning were to pass the senate bill, but were to attach amendments for more spending cuts. What are the chances the senate would reconvene and deal with it, pass what the house passed and allow the president to sign it into law? 
>> Reporter: Well, the senate just adjourned moments ago. Harry reid, the senate majority leader, just adjourned until noon tomorrow. So nothing would happen until noon tomorrow. But the senate, the democratic sources are saying that -- and they are being very quiet. They are not answering our obvious question, which is, what would you do if you got something that was amended. They're doing that on purpose. They don't want to sort of rock the boat. They don't want to give any sort of sense of yay or nay to house republicans to give anybody an excuse, basically. So they're being very, very quiet. But knowing the temperature over there, the fact that they feel pretty good about the fact that they passed this with not just a few republicans, two, three, four, but with 40 out of 45 republicans, 80, excuse me, 90% of the republican caucus in the senate voted for this, they feel no compunction, I don't think, to feel the need to take this up if the house changes it. They really understand that the house republicans will take the blame. 

[02:06:09]


>> Let's see what the house of representatives does in the next few hours. Dana, thank you. Our chief white house correspondent, jessica yellin, has been watching all of this unfold. She's joining us now. Republicans, jessica, they're concerned there simply aren't enough deficit savings in the bill that passed the senate last night. And indeed, the congressional budget office says the bill will add, not reduce, but add to the nation's debt. What's the rction at the white house? 
>> Reporter: Wolf, the congressional budget office's numbers can be a little confusing, actually. Because the truth of the matter is, the congressional budget office finds that it will increase the deficit by $3.9 trillion over ten years, but that's only when you take into account the fact that we have gone over the fiscal cliff. That increase in the deficit assumes that all americans have lost their tax cut, that the senate bill puts that tax cut back into place for 98% of americans, and all that revenue is being sucked out of government coffers. Now, if you go back one day and remeasure this same bill against the policy we had in place yesterday, when the bush tax cuts were in place, it finds that this bill actually decreases the deficit by $650 billion to $725 billion. A big difference, wolf. 
>> So how closely are the folks over at the white house behind you watching the latest republican meetings? What's going on in the house of representatives? 
>> Very, very closely, wolf. They are watching, they are waiting. And they are frustrated. There's not exactly surprise that this is taking so long, because they're ing a vated, both ways, with the house of representatives and the leadership there. The leadership often frustrated with the white house. And, you know, confident that if it gets to the floor, they will have the votes, it will pass. And there is some confidence that it will be before the night ends. But they're also sort of waiting and twiddling their thumbs. Earlier today, vice president biden, after he went up to the hill and spoke to house democrats made a lunch run. The white house mess here isn't open, so he ran out to a sandwich shop to get some food for his staff. Here, one of our producers had a chance to talk to him. 

[02:08:36]


>> Mr. Vice president, are we going to avoid the fiscal cliff. What did you say? I'm sorry. 
>> I hope so. I think so. 
>> Reporter: Now, I do know that if for any reason this deal collapses, you can expect full-frontal accusations from democrats that the republicans have sent the nation over the cliff. It is well-known here that the futures markets open in less than 30 minutes. Perhaps it will take a market event for a bill to pass, who knows? But they are watching very closely, wolf. 
>> Certainly are. Could be anotherong night for all of us. Thanks, jessica. Thanks very much. 
>>> Putting politics aside, what does it all mean for you? Cnn's tom foreman is here with the real-world impact of this huge debate unfolding in washington. Tom, what do taxpayers who are watching us right now, what do they need to know? 
>> Well, you know, wolf, we've been watching it from our first of all senate shop here all day today, trying to figure out how and if the plan that was concocted here can survive, and I think it's coming down to three pillars, wolf, as to whether or not this plan can become the law here. First of all, can the house republicans get past their sense that what was passed here last night was essentially a series of tax increases with no real emphasis on spending cuts. That's very hard for them to get past, because they think that's so antithetical as to what they think it will take to deal with the deficit, which will help all taxpayers. Secondly, they're going to be asking themselves, what does this do to the future negotiations on other issues that they're very concerned about. The debt ceiling, on two months, new negotiations on that. How much the government can borrow and what it will cost to pay it back. Sequestration, there were supposed to be automatic spending cuts if this budget deal isn't worked out by the end of the year. Now that's been pushed down the road. That's the second pillar of what they're considering. And the third, what does this do to normal people out there, what can they expect? If, in fact, the senate plan goes through as it's written right now and it's approved, the tax policy center has some estimates on what it's going to mean to normal taxpayers out there. If you make up to $200,000, your income tax isn't really going to change at all. You are going to pay more in payroll tax. Remember, last year we were enjoying a payroll tax deduction, a payroll tax holiday in this country. That has now expired. That extra $20, $30, $40, whatever it was based on your income that you had each month to pay on an extra tank of gas or the movies, that's going away, because the payroll tax holiday is over. But that's up to $200,000, not a great big change. Let's look a little bit higher here. If you go from $200,000 to $500,000, the income tax change actually goes down about $75, because only a portion of that group goes above that $450,000 level for couples that would have a greater increase. Everybody else benefits more. Payroll tax, same thing for this group, they're going to pay a little bit more on that, and there'll be a cap on personal deductions for the people in the upper end of that group. So basically, below $500,000 really very little impact on anyone. Let's go above it and you see the first real impact. 500,000 to $1 million a year. The average income tax increase this coming year for that group is going to be about $6,700, if the senate plan goes through as approved so far. They also have the payroll tax increase and their personal deductions will be capped and beyond the cap, obviously, they're gone. And once you go over $1 million a yr, if the president wanted to go after the people who make a lot of money, well, this does it. Over $1 million, the average income tax increase for that group is about $123,000 extra each year paid in income tax. But I do want to point out something, wolf. Very important here -- that's a big group. People who make just over $1 million, they're not going to pay nearly that much. And people who make tens of millions may pay a lot more. But if it goes, as it's written right now, that's the first read on what it's going to cost, folks. Wolf? 

[02:12:54]


>> Good explanation, tom. Thanks very, very much. I want to immediately go back to dana bash up on capitol hill. She's getting some more information about what the republicans might be doing. What are you learning, dana? 
>> Reporter: Wolf, remember, you and I talked just a little while ago about the fact that generally the process that leaders in the house use to try to whip votes is to call other votes, to talk to members face-to-face. And that is exactly what is happening. What just happened in this meeting, which is still going on, is that the house speaker, we are told, presented his members with two options. The first option is to add a pang of spending cuts, an amendment, to the senate will. But what they are going to do is they are going to first whip it. Meaning they're going to make sure that there are th218, or maybe 217, depending on who's voting, but that a majority of votes exist before they even add that. If they do find those votes, the house speaker said that they will take a vote on that tonight, as part of the senate bill, and send it back to the senate. But what's very interesting here is, that as part of presenting that option, we are told that the speaker made very clear to his rank and file republican members that there are risks in that strategy, and there's no guarantee the senate will act on it. If they don't find that there are 218 votes, mean fg that reading between the lines message that he clearly sent to them got through to enough of them, then they will take a vote, just on the senate bill, up or down vote, no amendments, and will be done. And all of this they're going to figure out tonight. 
>> So we've got another few hours to go before we know what's going on. By the way, dana, we checked earlier in the day with a clerk of the house. This current 112th congress. Apparently there's a vacant seat in the house, so I think the magic number is 217 right now as opposed to 218, which is normally the number you need for majority. 
>> Reporter: That's right. 217 right now, but it also depends on the members voting, which is why I said that. There are a lot of people who are retiring, who may not even be here. 

[02:14:59]


>> So it could be less. 
>> Reporter: Exactly. 
>> We'll watch the roll call, as we always watch these roll calls, to see when they decide to do. No decision yet. We'll stay in close touch with you. Dana bash, doing an excellent job for all of us. Who are the winners, who are the losers so far in this bruising political battle? We'll take a closer look at that, stand by.

>>> Republicans in the house of representatives, they're meeting right now. They're trying to figure out what to do as far as the senate legislation that passed overwhelming last night to avert that so-called fiscal cliff. Let's get the latest on where the republicans are moving right now. Joining us, a republican congressman from ohio, steve LaTOURETTE IS JOINING US. Congressman, thanks very much for coming in. 
>> Good to see you. 
>> I know you've been catching closely what's going to happen. What's your sense? Where are we going in the next few hours. 
>> The house will go into session in the next 15 minutes to vote on a serious of very important matters, naming post offices all across the country. But we will use that time, the whip will use that time to find out where the conference is and a couple of different proposals. Dana's reporting is right on the money. She has the proposals identified, and then at that moment in time, the leadership will make a decision as to which version to put on the floor later this evening. One that would have some spending cuts and the other would be just an up or down vote on the senate-passed package. 
>> If there's just an up or down vote on what the senate passed last night, 89-8, overwhelmingly passed in the senate, let's say that comes up without any amendments and 150 democrats vote in favor. Let's say 150 democrats, you need 67 republicans. Are there 67 republicans, you included, who would vote in favor of it? 
>> Well, I can count myself. I would vote in favor of it. And I think there's a growing sense that, you know, nobody's singing kenny rogers, but you do have to know when to hold them and when to fold them. We've been beaten in this fight. 
>> They're walking away. Hold on a second. I see the speaker walking past the cameras. They've broken up that meeting, apparently. They've just left. You saw the speaker and other members, they're walking out. I assume we're going to get more information momentarily. But go ahead. Sorry for interrupting your thought. 
>> That's okay. I think we've been whooped in this round. I would like to see spending cuts. This bill actually spends more money. But the choice as republicans we have now is do we sort of push this to the next level and make sure that taxes go up for, you know, 99% of americans. And that's really not a good choice to have. 

[02:20:02]


>> I guess I'm sort of confused right now. What has a better chance, and you know the house of representatives, you've served there for a long time, you're retiring right now. This is going to be one of your final votes. What has a better chance of passing? A clean bill, the bill that passed the senate last night, or amendments with more spending cuts, which would throw the legislation back to the senate and maybe disrupt it completely? 
>> Well, that's the dilemma we find ourselves in. And it's probably the senate bill has the better shot, because if they put on the floor an amendment to the senate bill, it's going to have to pass with only republican votes. We've been a little vote challenged in this congress, in terms of getting 217, 218 of our members to row in the same direction. But you do have, then, on the straight up or down vote, on the senate bill, you do have, i would trust, a majority of the democrats and I think you can get enough republican votes to pass this thing. 
>> To pass the senate version. 
>> Sure. 
>> That passed last night. Here's something, I'm still a little confused, I get conflicting information. Did the speaker john boehner promise that whatever passed the senate, if it was a bipartisan majority, he would let that come up, as is in the house, or did he hold out the notion that there could still be amendments? 
>> No, he always said that if the senate sent us something, we would do what's in regular order, and either vote on it, up or down, amend it, or reject it. He never said, we're just going to have a straight up or down vote on the senate bill, he said, we're going to decide what to do with it, and that's the subject of the meeting that's just been conclud. 
>> Because you know a lot of democrats and republicans in the senate right now, they say if you send back a new version with amendments, more spending cuts, or whatever new language, they're not even going to consider it in this congress. They may have to wait until the next congress. Who knows what the economic dislocations of that could be, when the markets open tomorrow. People are nervous right now. Hundreds of millions of americans are going to see a tax increase if you guys don't get your act together. 
>> Well, you know, and that's exactly the calculation that's going on. I would say -- I wouldn't throw all the burden on john boehner and the house of representatives. This bill that they gutted and sent over here last night after midnight has been sitting in the senate for about six months. So I think they could have acted on it earlier, but now the choice that we have is exactly as you have described it. Do we horse around and let taxes go up on almost everybody in the country, or do we save those taxpayers that we can? 

[02:22:25]


>> I asked darrell issa, the republican congressman from california, earlier where we stands on all of this. His answer was intriguing. Listen to this. 
>> I'm with eric cantor. I can't vote for it in its current form. And for a good reason. The senate, the president, and the vice president failed to meet their obligation, their own stated obligation, which was to bring us a balanced bill. One that had tax adjustment, yes, but also had spending cuts. This one fails at that and fails badly. 
>> He says he's with eric cantor. Do you sense, and you're a straight talker, straight shooter, congressman, there's a split, there's a disagreement between the speaker and the majority leader, between eric cantor and john boehner, the speaker? 
>> I think there's an disagreement, uh I have to say they're getting better long than they have since I've been here. But there's been a disagreement, and the leader said hcouldn't support the bill. But the speaker is a pragmatist and he's an institutionalist. And it was always, if you go back to plan "b" a week ago, it was always his desire to save as many taxpayers from tax increase as he could. His calculation is, that's what we're faced with tonight. And I would add parenthetically, I went to the same high school as issa, and we haven't agreed on much since. 
>> Did you agree with him in high school? 
>> I didn't see him much. 
>> I'm sure cleveland heights high school can be pretty proud of both of you. Hey, congressman, thanks very much for coming in. 
>> Who are the winners and who are the losers in this brutal fiscal cliff battle? We'll have a closer look at that. And the breaking news from capitol hill.

[02:27:00]


>>> All right. There it is, capitol hill. They're meeting late into the NIGHT ON THIS JANUARY 1st. Lots at stake. We're following the breaking news on capitol hill, where republicans, house republicans, they are weighing whether to amend the senate's fiscal cliff bill, send it back to the senate for more action. That could be the kiss of death during this current session. Many lawmakers on both sides of the aisle have grave concerns about this measure, the drama surrounding it, and their criticism is blunt. 
>> I wish I could say that this was a proud moment. A moment in which we started the year off right, in which the first of january was the first of a great many good things. It isn't. We're kicking the can down the road. 
>> We're about to have a hold your nose vote here in the house of representatives. And many of us are going to wrestle with the problem of making perfect be the enemy of the good. 
>> SENATOR mitch McConnell observed, quote, this shouldn't be the model for how we do things around here, end quote, and then the senate proceeded like a bull in a china closet anyway. The senate boasts, it is america's deliberative body. Today, that claim rings hollow. 
>> This agreement represents absolutely the least we could have done under these circumstances and tragically, institutionalizes for the next congress the madness of short-term frenzy around artificial deadlines, that drives the american public crazy. 
>> It's year day, 2013. What an excellent time for congress to make at least new year's resolution. Congress is addicted to spending money. Maybe congress should join spending anonymous. 
>> A new year's deal for new year's day. Or is it groundhog day? Because like the "groundhog day," this governmen in another two months will arrive at another month of debt, spending, and taxes. 
>> We're joined now by ryan lizza, the correspondent for the new yorker magazine. This is the actual bill that passed the senate last night. 

[02:29:05]


>> How many do you think read it? 
>> It's 150 pages or so of gobbledygook if you will, a lot of words in here. Hard to understand what's going on. If the house of representatives amends this, adds a few more pages, what are the chances that tomorrow or thursday morning the senate, the current senate, will pass it? 
>> I have to say, it seems very low. I think the vote tonight that house republicans have is a vote to kill this bill or not. If you're voting yes on the amended bill, if that gets to the floor, then you're voting to kill the legislation and end these fiscal cliff negotiations. Because as boehner seems to have pointed out from the reporting that dana has been doing in the conference, he was suggesting to his conference that if we vote for an amended version, it's highly unlikely that the senate is going to pick that up. 
>> Let they come up with an amended version of this bill, right? No democrats, maybe one or two, but basically no democrats are going to vote in favor. You need 217 republicans. Will there be 217 republicans who will vote for this -- 
>> that is the mystery for today. I wish I knew the answer to that. They're not going to bring it to the floor unless they have the votes. The boehner deal, if he finds he has 217 votes tonight, by going one by one to his members -- if he's got those votes,e brings it to the floor. 
>> Let's say he doesn't have 217, will they take this up, what passed the senate last night? I think that would pass. 
>> Exactly. That's what he's saying. He's saying, if he doesn't have those votes, this goes to the floor. We seem to know most democrats would vote for that. And then he has to get -- 
>> I've heard 150 democrats would vote for it. And if he gets 67 republicans, you've got a deal. 
>> and LaTourette suggested that those 67 republicans are there. So high drama tonight, to see if this whip count comes through. Because if we see the amended version on the floor, this deal is dead. 

[02:31:07]


>> What does this say about john boehner as speaker of the house? What's been going on, not just over the past 24 hours, but over the past few days? 
>> He's got a very complicated conference and he's not a super empowered, powerful speaker. There was a time in american politics where the speaker of the house could tell his conference or caucus what to do. Those days are over. And john boehner, you know, to be fair to him, when he first came in had been, he said, I'm going to dissolve power, I'm going to make my committee chairman more powerful, and listen to the will of the conference on things like that. So he does not have control over the republican conference. This is more proof of than we could ever -- 
>> I know I covered the house for a long time. There are a lot of speakers -- you know, sam rayburn would never have allowed anything like this -- 
>> denny hastert. Go back to the bush era of republican leadership, if they wanted the votes, they found the votes. A lot of tea party republicans who have come in since then, they didn't like the way things were done back then. They didn't like the all-powerful speaker, because they thought that that led to big deficits and spending. 
>> If he lets this come up, as is, what the senate passed last night and doesn't have a majority of the majority, which was the denny hastert so-called rule, that would be significant. 
>> That would be significant. Because he's then allowing democrats to put this across the finish line. The other thing, what are the spending cuts? Nobody has seen the amendments to this bill, the supposed amendments that are these detailed spending cuts. It's kind of got lost in this whole process. If they are going to amend this bill with very specific spending cuts, up until now, no one's outlined them. 
>> Don't they need 72 hours to let the members review? That was the rule they passed, but I guess they'll have to throw that away. 
>> This would clearly viola that rule. And in the past, boehner has said, if there was some kind of emergency, they would waive that rule. 
>> So what I hear you saying, and I think I would agree with you, the chances are at least right now, a little bit better, that they don't have the 217 for amendments, but they probably will have enough to pass what the senate passed? 

[02:33:08]


>> I'm not sure I agree with that. 
>> You're not ready to go down -- 
>> I think there are enough republicans in the house who want to vote for a bill with spending cuts, if that's the choice they have. 
>> Even if that means you're effectively going over the cliff and millions and millions of americans are going to see their taxes going up? 
>> I think that's where the house republican conference is right now. I could be wrong, but I think that's what we've learned today, is they don't like this legislation, and if the choice is between a bill with spending cuts and one without cuts, most republicans will choose the spending cuts bill. I could be wrong, I hope I'm wrong, and I think it's better for the country if we get a deal and this gets resolved tonight. 
>> We'll see what happens and we'll be watching it every step of the way. Thanks very much. 
>>> Financial markets around the world, they will soon be opening to news, a deal that the fiscal cliff could be in limbo right now. It actually is in limbo. So who will they make of all the uncertainty going on here in washington? We're going around the world to get some reaction. ...so as you can see, GEICO's customer satisfaction is at 97%. Mmmm tasty.

Someone get me a latte will ya, please? ! 

[02:36:32]


>>> They're trying toing figure out in the house of representatives right now what to do. Will they simply consider the senate legislation that passed overwhelmingly in the middle of the night? Will there be an up and down vote on that? If it passes, it goes to the president for his signature, the fiscal cliff being averted. On the other hand, will they go ahead and try to pass some spending cut amendments, which would disrupt this entire process and maybe kill it in this current congress. Tax increases would g forward for millions and millions of americans. We're watching what's happening in the congress right now. World financial markets are watching very closely as well. They'll soon start reopening after the new year holiday, beginning shortly in asia, later overnight in europe, followed by wall street in the mourning. Let's go to our chief business correspondent, ali velshi in new york. Ali, what will make investors take a look at this fiscal cliff uncertainty and decide to buy or sell? What's going to happen? 
>> Well, they're really going to wait for the same thing we're waiting for. And that is scertainty. So at this point, as you've been reporting so well for a few hours, we don't know whether the house is going to vote or whether america is really going over the fiscal cliff for a few days. Now, we've got only australia open at the moment and new zealand. These are not markets that will give us a real sense of how the rest of the world is going to go, and that's because those markets are influenced by other sources. We're looking for seoul, hong kong, and shanghai, all of whi will be open within an hour and a half to two hours, to see how markets are reacting to whatever deal we have. Hopefully in two hours, we'll have had some news about to whether this is going to be an up or down vote in the house of representatives, which means everybody gets to vote whether they're in favor of it or not, or whether it's goingo be a whipped vote that could either fail or go back to the senate with amendments. So at the moment, wolf, international investors are looking at exactly the same thing we're looking at. If america goes over the fiscal cliff, the net result will be a pullback on growth in the united states, and that is going to be bad for international markets and for international investors. If, on the other hand, the deal that was approved in the senate goes through, then we are probably looking at a pullback in expected growth of about half of 1%, not as serious, and that will probably be positive for markets. Wolf? 

[02:38:54]


>> When wall street opens tomorrow, let's say there is no deal, and the uncertainty is there, should we be bracing for one of those big collapses, hundreds of point loss on the dow jones? 
>> If I had that kind of good information, I would be calling this report in from my yacht, wolf. But let me tell you what I do think. The s&p 500 closed about 13.5% higher for the year, which is higher than the long-term average. It would have been much higher than that. It would have been 15% or more, except that last week, it gave up a lot of gains on fears of getting no deal. So it's entirely possible a good amount of this is already priced into the markets. You'll sense some disappointment if we don't have a deal. It all depends. Does the house come out tonight and say, no deal on anything, we don't like anything about this deal and we'll have to start from scratch. Or is it going to be one of those things that the new congress will take up and we'll get resolution within a few days. The flavor and shape of what we get out of the house of representatives tonight will influence trading tomorrow. I want to caution people, we've already got future trades for u.S. Markets underway, but you never want to look at futures this many hours before a market opens. I only tend to lack at futures within two to three hours of a market opening to get a sense of how that market's going to do. I'll be looking at asian markets to get a sense of how they're behaving around 8:00, 8:30 eastern time. Without solid information, we don't want to look to markets for guidance, when really the guidance we're looking for is going to come out of the house of representatives. 
>> I know you're filling in for aaron burnett at the top of the hour. Give us a little preview. What's coming up on "outfront"? 
>> We'll do a lot of the same stuff you've been doing, wolf. Follow very closely with our great group of reporters in washington, hopefully we'll have some development, some sense of whether that whipping of the republican caucus is coming through. We'll also talk to representative tom cole of oklahoma. He was the one who said, why don't we agree to this deal exactly. A deal that deals with taxes and then focus on how to deal with spending. So we're going to get his opinion and see like steve LaTOURETTE, LIKE YOU JUST TALKED To, which way he's leaning in this deal. Thanks very much. We'll be watching at the top of the hour, ali velshi, doing excellent, excellent work for all of us.

>>> North korea's leader, kim jong-un, delivers the country's first new year's address in nearly two decades. 
>> Kim jong-un is calling for what he says should be an all-out struggle to overhaul his country's destitute economy, as well as an easing of tensions with south korea. But the young leader also praised last month's controversial launch of a long-range rocket. The launch was widely condemned by the united nations and considered to be a test of ballistic missile technology. We'll have much more on this later in the program. 
>>> The iranian military claims it has successfully test fired a number of advanced missiles and air defense systems during exercises near the key strategic oil passageway of the strait of hormuz. The exercises are part of what iran says is six days of naval maneuvers. They come as the country is facing increased pressure from the united states and international community over its controversial nuclear program.

>>> Many americans are ringing in the new year with new laws that took effect at the stroke of midnight. And for some same-sex couples in maryland, that means wedding bells. Brian todd has details. 
>> Reporter: Wolf, an historic day for social change in the united states. Today, maryland became the first state south of the mason-dixon line, that's the historic line dividing north and south in america, the first state south of that line to have legalized same-sex marriage. And this is the place that lent so much symbolism to it all, city hall here in baltimore. At just after midnight, several same-sex couples got married right here. Baltimore mayor stephanie rawlings blake officiated at their ceremonies. Some of them spoke to reporters. Take a listen. 
>> Jim and I met in 1977. And at that time, I just didn't really believe that gay people would ever see the day that they could marry. 
>> I'm very happy. This is as happy as I've ever been, and to be able to spend the rest of my life with bill, legally, and just show the gay communities, it can be done. 
>> Reporter: Now, maryland's governor martin o'malley went against several leaders of his own catholic faith, including the archbishop of baltimore, to push this through the state legislature. All in all, nine states in america, including the district of columbia, have now legalized same-sex marriage. President obama's home state of illinois may be next. There is an initiative that may be introduced in the coming days in illinois. Also, the u.S. Supreme court is going to review two cases, two challenges to federal and state laws that define marriage as a union between a man and a woman. So a lot coming up legislatively and at the supreme court regarding same-sex marriage. Wolf? 
>> Brian, thank you. Other laws takes effect this year, in illinois, middle schoolers, get this, they must now learn how to use a defibrillator. It's not illegal to possess or sell shark fins. And for sex offenders to dress up as santa claus or the easter bunny or hand out candy on halloween. In florida, it's no longer illegal to flash your headlights to warn other drivers of a speed trap. In oregon, teachers are now required to report suspected student bullies. And in california, employers can't require employees or job applicants, for that matter, to disclose their social media passwords. Illinois passed a similar measure.

>>> News of a blood clot between hillary clinton's brain and her skull now raising some questions about her future. Will her current health crisis have any impact at all? Cnn's mary snow is back with this part of the story. First, what's the latest on hillary clinton's condition, mary? 
>> Her doctors haven't updated her condition since disclosing the details of the blood clot that put secretary of state hillary clinton in the hospital sunday, saying she's making excellent progress. An expert in blood clots told us if left untreated, these clots can be very serious but he said the fact it's being addressed is a good sign things should return to normal. On a day when secretary of state hillary clinton was supposed to be getting ready to return to work, she spent another day at a new york hospital. Her doctors say they are treating her with blood thinners after discovering a blood clot in the vein between brain and skull behind the right ear. They expect her to make a full recovery and say she did not suffer a stroke or neurological damage. Dr. Jack ansell is not involved in secretary clinton's case but has treated cases like hers, and calls them rare. He's the chairman of the department of medicine at lenox hill hospital. What does this mean for the future? 
>> I think her future is as good as her past. She should recover from this. She will be treated with blood thinners. I can't say how long because i don't know all of the circumstances but certainly, minimum of three to six months, may well be longer. Could in some rare cases be life-long but many patients are on blood thinners for life for other conditions. She should recover fully and get back to work. 
>> Reporter: That work is grueling. Hillary clinton has traveled to more than 100 countries as secretary of state and logged close to a million miles during that time. Dr. Ansell says while travel is something to watch out for among people who suffer blood clots, most often in the leg veins, which mrs. Clinton did have in THE LATE 1990s, HE DOESN'T SEE Her travel schedule being an impediment. 
>> I think the travel is probably more an issue of with the blood clot she had back about 12 years ago in her leg, so anybody who has had a blood clot, they are always at risk for developing another one, and the risk is probably a little greater than if they never had a blood clot. So I think travel is potentially an issue for the secretary, but I would imagine that when she travels, she's not sitting in a coach seat cramped up and sitting still. 

[02:54:30]


>> Reporter: Secretary clinton is planning to step down as president obama's second term begins. While she has repeatedly said she is not interested in running for president again, she is viewed as the democratic favorite in 2016 should she choose to run. Wolf, doctors familiar with these types of rare clots say that it is unlikely it developed as a side effect of secretary clinton's recent concussion. Some speculated it could be tied to another underlying condition or perhaps simply dehydration. Her aides say she experienced that after a stomach virus a few weeks ago. Wolf? 
>> She had a stomach virus, flu, she was dehydrated, she fainted, then she got the concussion as a result of falling and hitting her head. We wish her, of course, a speedy, speedy recovery. Hope that she gets back into action very soon. Mary, thank you. 
>>> When we come back, one of the country's most important documents makes a rare appearance to mark a very significant milestone.. What? Customers didn't like it. So why do banks do it? Hello? Hello?! If your bank doesn't let you talk to a real person 24/7, you need an ally. Hello? Ally bank. Your money needs an ally. off irritant. It'll cause cavities, bad breath. Patients will try and deal with it by drinking water. Water will work for a few seconds but if you're not drinking it, it's going to get dry again. I recommend biotene. All the biotene products like the oral rinse...The sprays have enzymes in them. The whole formulation just works very well. It leaves the mouth feeling fresh. If I'm happy with the results and my patients are happy with the results, I don't need to look any farther. ???????????? 

[02:58:30]


>>> the 16th president of the united states certainly has been getting a lot of attention lately. First there was the release of the popular film "lincoln" starring daniel day-lewis. Now the country is marking the 150th anniversary of abraham lincoln's emancipation proclamation. The document which placed freeing the slaves at the top of abraham lincoln's wartime agenda was read aloud today at the national archives here in washington. 
>> That on the first day of january in the year of our lord 1863, all persons held as slaves within any state or designated part of a state, the people whereof shall then be in rebellion against the united states, shall be then henceforth and forever free. 
>> The document was transferred from the state department to the national archives back in 1936. It's so fragile that it can be displayed only a few days out of the year. One of the most important documents in our history. I'll be back later tonight, 9:00 p.M. Eastern. I'm filling in for piers morgan later tonight. We're watching what's happening in the u.S. House of representatives. Deal or no deal? We don't know right now. The stakes, though, are enormous.

I for "the wendy williams show." Today -- "the good wife's" alan cumming. Is his big-screen role getting oscar buzz? Plus, get ready for holiday fashions you can afford. Plus, wendy has all the latest juicy hot topics. Now, here's wendy! ???????????? ?????? shout it out ?????? 
>> Wendy: Hi, everybody, welcome to the show. My studio audiences, my co-hosts, thank you for being part of this party. Thank you. How you doin'? I'm doing great today. You know, tweef got a lot to talk about. There's a celebrity couple that got engaged or twitter, an "x factor" judge might be headed for a breakup. And they say that kanye is hurting h ka -- his career is hurting because of kim kardashian. I have all the details and more. Let's talk about it. It's time for hot topics. Thank you! Thank you.Erybody. Appreciate you being here. So, thank you, studio audience. By the way, how many are in new york from out of town? Visiting for the holidays? Terrific. Welcome to our jewel box. The final three contestants competed last njght on "the voice." Only the judges once again have stolen the show. I couldn't even tell you what the contestants did or anything about them. I get very distracted and I mean that in a good way. Adam levine, he performed "dude looks like a lady." Although he's dressed as axl rose, that is aerosmith's song. I like that. Then christina aguilera sporting the top hat and shiny wig. Then cee lo green comes out with a mini him. Okay? I just -- I mean, and after the judges do their thing where they grab the spotlight, you forget all about the contestants. But, you know, I love the judges being all sassy and cee lo and adam and christina, you all have really raised the bar for usher to come in there and also shakira. I've got to tell you, I am looking with a crooked eye as to whether these two can be as entertaining of judges as t judges we currently have on "the voice." "The voice" has a three-hour finale airing tonight on nbc. I'm not even thinking about contestants. I'm thinking, three hours, how many costume behaviors and cy changes can we get from our judges? Come on, judges, bring it! You know, channing tatum was named sexiest man alive. Now he's going to be the sexiest dad alive. That's a good-looking couple right there, channing and his wife jenna is expecting. She sparked the rumors on sunday when she walked the red carpet for vh1's divas. A dress like that, yeah, will spark pregnancy speculation. Don't you love that headband thing? I so want to do that. Every time I put one on in the privacy of my own bathroom, i always feel like, you know, I'm channeling a 15-year-old or it's too costumy, but it looks good on everyone else. I love that look. Anyway, congratulations, you guys. Okay, so now the word is that kim kardashian could be hurt hadding kanye west's career. Well, if you think about it, and according to the "new york daily news," kanye's credibility as an artist, they say, is being challenged because of all of his cheesy behavior with kim, the tabloid appearances, appearing on that reality show. The last thing I want to see kanye do is have baby mason on his lap. There's just something -- we've seen that in the "people" magazine. I don't want to see -- I get that kanye perhaps, because he lost his mother and he doesn't have siblings so he doesn't have family, we all know how important family is, how incredibly seductive a large loving family like the kardashians could be. But sources are saying his personal life is overwhelming his music career. He's even had trouble selling tickets for, yeah, an upcoming show. And reportedly he was also offered -- several offers to host new year's eve parties, but only if he brings her, kim. I mean, there was a time when kanye was kanye and, you know, just was so cheesy. I mean, I agree with the critics. And I think baby mason is very cute, but I just don't want to see baby mason on top of kanye's shoulders and I don't want to see kanye part of the reality show where they all go over to the house and he's talking in the kitchen with bruce. Or he's shopping with scott. You know, if memory serves me, the other day I was listening to some kanye music and he did use scott disick's name in it. Exactly! Even people with no street cred or care, even you guys understand this, don't you? Some of you guys do. I mean, it's just not a good look. I mean, it's a good look for you, kim, because your makeup pared down with the good dresses and stuff, you've never looked more beautiful, but this not looking for our boy kanye. By the way, the official -- don't show it yet, let me build it up -- annual kardashian holiday christmas card was released today. Hold on. Kanye, the best thing you could have done is not shown up for the photo shoot. We're going to get that street cred back soon enough. And here's the picture! Uh-huh. Uh-huh. There's bruce. Look at the brother with his arms wide open. Kris, you look snatched and beautiful. Kim, you are the fairest of them all. Lamar is in it because he's already signed on that dotted line. Lamar's got no choice! Good luck and happy holidays, kardashian and kanye. So there's lots of hollywood romantical news. It's time for hook ups and break ups. The tattoo artist kat von d and her boyfriend dj dead mouse -- look, I had never heard of him to begin with either, and to me -- she ups his fame because many of us have never heard of dj dead mouse it's okay to admit when we're not that cool. But apparently it's our problem because he has over a million twitter followers, he is a successful deejay. They tweeted about their relationship but taken it to a whole new level. Dead mouse proposed kat von d on twitter. To me -- see, you're my people. Here's what he tweeted. This is taking all the romance and old school out of anything, dead mouse. I can't wait for christmas so, katherine von deet renberg, will you marry me? Changing the diamond to a black diamond fyi, sorry for the jpeg. They'll finish the actual ring soon, I hope. I love you. Okay. Before she even got a chance to have this tweet and say yes or no to the proposal, the twitter followers of each were congratulating both of them. She's like, congratulations on what? Then she looks and she does accept, but this was just so impersonal. And I just hope this is not the wave of the future. I mean, we're forgoing a lot of old-fashioned stuff we used to do. To each his own on that. Personally speaking, I feel that thing where a man has to drop to his knee, please, you don't have to drop to his knee. And that thing where you have to get somebody's father's permission to marry them, unless you're one of the obama girls or something a little bit more regal, if you're just a regular girl from jersey, my father's opinion, when I'm grown, about who I marry, it's cute, but he doesn't have to go to him. Do you believe in that part? Some of you do. What about the dropping on one knee? Oh, you like that. You're so dramatic, you guys. So dramatic. Congratulations to you, kat von d. You're a very beautiful woman and I like you a lot through the tv. And dj mouse, it's nice to meet you. Congratulations. Here's a possible breakup according to rumors. And the funny thing is, i promise you I said this to my hot topics producersed the other day. I just wish I would have said it on tv so you would go, does wendy know something? It's not that, but I said to them, I don't think this jason treadwick is going to be marrying this britney spears at any point at all. I bet he's sick and tired of being a caretaker instead of a fiance. That's how it looks to me in the magazines and on tv. According to rumors, britney and jason are about to split. Britney has no clue. Hollyscoop.Com rumors that he wants out of the relationship and he's had to sit down with mr. And mrs. Spears. There's an exceptions to every rule. She does not look well. Can we agree on that? By the way, there's that three-finger pose again? Remember we were talking about that the other day? See? I love britney spears so please to all of her fans, please, you know I always say that I love her, but there's something about britney that never looks present to me. She doesn't look well. And he was -- he's waiting, according to our sources, until the "x factor" is over because he's worried that britney might take the news too hard and then maybe she'd do something at the table. Now, that would be worth the $15 million! But that's not what we want for britney, you know, seriously. She is like bambi and jason allegedly wants to stay her manager after the breakup. See, you didn't reacting too horribly after that. I think there's an exception to every rule. I don't believe -- first of all, this guy jason, let me just tell you, he's 40 years old but with the thinning hair and the gray he looks like he needs to get out quick! You're aging fast. Look, he was a big-time agent in hollywood, had some really, really grade-a cents. But he gave up those clients years ago to solely look after britney, look after her career. We were made to believe they fell in love and they would get engaged. You know, okay, I'm a cynic as far as that. I think that he's a nice guy that mr. And mrs. Spears are probably very fortunate to have in her life. There's nothing about me that thinks this guy is crookedy. I'm not jaded about jason at all. I think he's -- he seems like a stand-up guy. But he's only 40 and I'm sure he wants to get back to regular life with regular clients, maybe date a girl who's present and go on and maybe make a family for himself and, you know, there's some people where money is not everything. And perhaps he's had it with being instead of in a real relationship my mind, a caretaker. Do you understand? And then there's another source that's claiming that they haven't heard anything about this split and that britney and jason are going on vacation for the holidays. Okay. Well, brad and jennifer aniston went on their final vacation before they came back and it was over, too. Anyway, the "x factor" finale is tomorrow and thursday. We'll be watching this relationship for you. So it's now time for celebrity court report. Hit it. All right, so khloe kardashian and her nba husband lamar odom -- well, lamar was due in court for the custody hearing here in new york with his ex-girlfriend baby's mother liza morales. Doesn't lamar have a type? That's liza. Khloe and liza, if you squint, they look very similar. Anyway, lamar wants to have more time with his kids, according to sources, so that the kids can appear on upcoming episodes of his reality show "khloe and lamar." Cheesy reasons to want more time with your kids, lamar. Liza doesn't want the kits to be part of khloe and lamar take on the world. And lamar was advised not to travel to new york due to a recent game injury. The court offered to reschedule the hearing. Instead, lamar decided to stay in l.A. And plead his case over the telephone. There's no word on what the judge is going to decide. You know what? Judge, tell them no, on account of you know why this is had happening. This is happening because khloe and lamar take on the world, or whatever the title of the show is going to be -- you know, khloe'ses been trying to get pregnant according to what we read in magazines and it hasn't happened yet. They need something to spice up the story line of these two. Lamar, I bet, won't be around quite as much because his friends are probably now in his ear telling him, yo, it's kind of whacked that you're on that reality show all the time! All the time! Lamar, you know, it's taking down your cred. So they're going to bring these kids in and show our khloe -- i love khloe -- being stepmom. But it's not the most authentic thing. I don't even -- liza, don't let him do it. And, look, also lamar's ex, lizas who lives here in new york has her own reality show on tlc. I don't know what it's going to be called but nor now I'm calling it "bitter exes of the rich and famous." She's going to be on it, and i don't know whether the kids appear on the show. But for some reason, in my mind, it's okay for the kids to appear on this show because the mom is the custody holder and main parent instead of a prop. I'm just saying. Now it's time for the inside scoop. 

[00:16:50]


>> Audience just saw a whole hot mess going on behind the scenes. Here to share some juicy celebrity stories from hollywoodlife.Com, please welcome our friend chloe murez. Let's talk justin bieber and selena gomez. What's the tea? 
>> Remember, wendy, justin and selena broke out because justin was hanging out with victoria's secret models. Remember that? 
>> Yes. 
>> Justin is hanging out with somebody else, but it's not a girl. It's actually selena's ex-boyfriend nick jonas. She's really upset about it, and these two are possibly recording music again. Selina dumped him and he's reportedly calling crying, and she's just not having it anymore. Why would your guy be hanging out with her ex-boyfriend? It looks like he's just trying to stir up trouble. Selena is hanging out with her besty taylor swift and trying to get her to date one of the boys in one direction. 
>> I get confused. Is nick the one on the jonas show on e!? 
>> No. Nick's the baby. Justin has no business hanging out with jonas. 
>> No. This was a two-year relationship, it wasn't a hookup. 
>> He's calliselena,s wanting to get back together. She's proposely feeling sentimental and vulnerable. He did rent out the staples center for her a year ago. Maybe she wants a gift. 
>> I say she has her own money and can get her own gift. Let's hang out with taylor and put red lipstick on and get some boys! 

[00:18:57]


>> Never ever ever getting back together. 
>> That's right. 
>> Michael douglas' son cameron got hurt in prison. 
>> Michael douglas had a hard year, his cancer, catherine zeta-jones kind of spiralled. His son cameron went to jail for selling heroin and meth. He's serving for ten years. 
>> He's got a history. 
>> He got in trouble in prison for smuggling drugs into prison. So she extended his sentence. Here's what happened. His psychiatrist accidentally leaked some information and the prisoners found out that he actually is a rat, is what they call him, and that cameron had ratted out a mob boss and so a lot of the prisoners got upset. 
>> Whoa, whoa, whoa! We're big in prisons. Easy. 
>> They got upset and allegedly put a bounty on his ead, any prisoner who could get to him first and beat had him up, the bounty was only 100 bucks. 
>> And a carton of cigarettes? 
>> So they broke his femur and he has a broken finger. The femur is a hard bone to break. He, though, didn't say the prisoners did it to him. He said he hurt himself playing handball. So michael douglas is really upset. He always goes and visits cameron, about a 200-mile drive from new york to pennsylvania at the prison he ace at. He's upset about the medical care his son is getting. They're not treating him any it differently because he's michael douglas' son. 
>> The femur has to be fused over time. 
>> He has a rod in his bone. 
>> This report is not helping out the fact that he's a rat. 
>> Oh, I know. Hope they'rewatching. 
>> Oh, believe me. Ow you doin'? 

[00:21:00]


>> A big scoop was dropped with christina milian here on your sh there's been a lot of speculation as to whether or not chris browning karrueche or rhianna. Sources are telling hollywoodlife.Com that this is true, he is really in love with karrueche, he really cares about her. He's in south africa on his carp pe diem tour. 
>> Rihanna thought she was there with him alone and karrueche showed up wearing his clothes. Not very nice but interesting. 
>> The big thing is chris is bouncing around between rhianna who he loves and karrueche. It's this big mess. 
>> Who's going to get pregnant soon and then you'll never get rid of her. 
>> The big test is christmas is just a week away. Who will he spend the holidays with, new year's eve with? Thereere rumors about marrying rhianna in barbados over new year's eve. It looks like chris cannot let karrueche leave. Karrueche is focusing on her fashion line and trying to not get upset about what's going on. She doesn't like being called a sidepiece. 
>> Well, then, make sure he chooses you for the girlfriend and we'll call you that. Until then, I can't figure it out so both of you are sidepieces to this man who's not worthy of either of you. 
>> Right! I agree. 
>> There! 
>> Clony, an excellent report. You look really cute today, by the way. If you want more celebrity stories, check out hollywoodlife.Com. Chloe is our friend. You guys, we have a great show for you.

>> Your honor, we are requesting mark be released into our custody. 
>> Your request is denied. And after lying to this court about the true nature of your relationship, you are lucky i don't charge you both with perjury. 
>> Respectfully, we ask you to consider -- 
>> he belongs with us! 
>> Get your client under control. 
>> Is this your idea of justice? We are talking about a human life here! 
>> Mr. Don atell la. 
>> A human life you guys don't give a [ muted ] about. 
>> Wendy: Hi! Nice to meet you, too! Oh, my gosh! I love when people dress for the occasion. Happy holidays. 
>> Happy holidays! 
>> Wendy: Beautiful. And I've seen a lot of pictures of you in your real life going to parties and things like that and on the red carpet. You are a very snappy dresser. 
>> Why, thanks. It's called -- >>Wendy: WE HAVE A FEW OF YOUR Red carpet pictures. Everybody, just take a look. Fabulous, more fabulous and the most. 
>> That's a good one. I like the red one tarten one. 
>> Wendy: You're from scotland. 
>> Yes, I am. How did you know? 
>> Wendy: You can't tell by your acting because you're able to get rid of your accent and affect a new york accent. On "the good wife" you don't have a scottish accent. 
>> Sometimes I do, sometimes i make mistakes. But it's always -- I think people think it's more of a big deal. 

[00:27:12]


>> Wendy: Like a shock value. 
>> My accent, you mean? It's not as hard as people think to do an ang sent when you have an ear for it. In that movie, I kind of studied a wee bit because that is a more particular accent. I once did a film in minnesota and I played a minnesotan farmer. 
>> Wendy: That's a particular accent also. 
>> Oh, yeah. 
>> Wendy: You know who you look like? You look like a combination of pee-wee herman. 
>> I get that. 
>> Wendy: And ryan gosling. 
>> Oh! I'll take that. 
>> Wendy: Yes! Do you have a christmas tree for the holidays? 
>> No. I have a horse. 
>> Wendy: You have a christmas horse? 
>> I do. It's like -- it's our christmas tree, but I have this big huge horse neon life-size but flat horse, like a flat stanley but it's a horse. And it's got a saddle on it and a bridle t. Was from a show on broadway I did so I kept it. And it's just a nice thing and it lights up around the rim of it in blue neon. So we dangle things from it. 
>> Wendy: You're always different. Can't ever go with the flow. Everybody else has christmas trees you've got the horse. You said we. I know that you are married. 
>> Yes. 
>> Wendy: How long have you been married? 
>> I've been married for nearly six years. 
>> Wendy: Do you and your husband want children? 
>> No. 
>> Wendy: You've thought about it? 
>> I've thought about it. Over the years, even before him, I thought about it a lot. I wrote a novel about ten years ago that was just a thinly veiled memoir about me having my thoughts about having a child on my own or not in a arelationship. I've given it a lot of thought. Now I'm in this really great relationship, would be the best time ever to do it, we just aren't going to. We're content, you know? 

[00:29:17]


>> Wendy: Yes. You are on the same page with that. Now that it's easier for gay people to adopt, there's more pressure. When are you going to adopt? Stop it I wanted to ask about p your wig. 
>> Wendy: It's twonbre. 
>> I had a wig on in the clip. And they took my hair and put it over the back. 
>> Wendy: It's front hair realness. It looks real in the front but it's all fake. Back to your -- 
>> kids? 
>> Wendy: Not kids. That's done. 
>> Selena gomez? I'm furious at selena. 
>> Wendy: Why? For going back with justin bieber. 
>> Did she go back with him? Selena's angry because justin is talking to jonas and she's take taking succor with taylor swift? I think taylor swift is the perfect person to go to boy advices to. 
>> Wendy: They're young. I can see them with the red lipstick and scarves and picking up boys. 
>> Picking up boys, doing them in the back seat. 
>> Wendy: They're young. We remember what it was like. So let's talk about your movie that you have out now. In part of the movie you play a '70s DRAG QUEEN. 
>> It starts off -- yeah. 
>> Wendy: I love it. 
>> The first time you see me, it's so embarrassing. There I am. There's another bit, there's a carmen miranda moment. I did two drag bits. The second bit is even more horrifying than that. They give me like a gauzy tummy, like all one thing. It's not like my tummy and then the -- 

[00:31:28]


>> Wendy: That feels weird. 
>> Yes. I play a drag queen and then he stops being a drag queen and sings, but he meets this guy very quickly, then they -- 
>> Wendy: The premise of the movie. 
>> There's a gay couple in the '70s TRY TO ADOPT A DOWN Syndrome boy they've t in bhis mom is taken away. When they find out we're gay they take him away. 
>> Wendy: You're wonderful in the movie. Congrats on the oscar buzz. You're wonderful. Is it true you're going back to the stage with liza minelli?

>> Wendy: How you doin'? We're back. Time for "ask wendy". 
>> My name is carey and my husband is a hotel security guard and he works nights. He's 34 and works with the land of twentysomething beauties. With that said, I trust my husband 100% and these girls have even babysat my kids. A lot of photos come up on facebook, my husband with these girls. 
>> Wendy: What he's doing? 
>> He's a hotel security guard. 
>> Wendy: So he's hugging? 
>> These photos that we know come up on facebook. How do I go about getting the photos to stop? Because I'm 0 afraid the world thinks my husband is cheating. I do trust him, you know. They all know me. I've met them. 
>> Wendy: I get what you're saying. First of all, forget what the world thinks. If you know your man, you know it's good. But I also understand the problem with facebook is you no longer have control of your image or the image of your husband had. 
>> Right. 
>> Wendy: I think this warrants a conversation with your husband. I like the way you talk. You don't seem jealous but you seem concerned. Twentysomethings who don't have responsibility for anything but themselves and fun. Today it's a picture like this, tomorrow might be a different kind of picture. Not infidelity but a different kind. I would talk to your husband and also not have these girls babysit anymore. Talk about what's appropriate for a married man with your husband. To you, that's not appropriate. 
>> Thanks, wendy. 
>> Wendy: We have to go to a break. Up next, holiday-inspired fashions. Keep it here. ] up cuisine? Try our entrees, snacks and new salads. Salmon with basil, garlic chicken spring rolls, and now salads, like asian-style chicken. Enjoy over 130 tasty varieties, anytime. Lean cuisine.

>> Wendy: Let's get our fashion show started. As usual, our models are from our audience. Our first trend is sparkle and shine on eva longoria. Talk about the trend. 
>> It's just so festive. We have eva in a very glamorous bronze sequin long-sleeved dress. 
>> Wendy: Very pretty. 
>> This is all about bling. Think sequins, lame and any reflective fabric. 
>> Wendy: Sel-ver is our first model. I love it! 
>> I know. Sel-ver is literally sparkling and shining. She is the trend personiied. 
>> Wendy: You've got a good body! 
>> Doesn't she? This is a silver sequinned dress from the letter. It's just $99 on gilt.Com. Ladies, the great thing about this dress, it actually has a lot of stretch so it is really wearable and forgiving. And you don't often find that in this kind of material. 
>> Wendy: No, you don't. 
>> We're really loving the gathered hip detail. This is something you can look out for in any dress you buy. It's a great silhouette and very forgiving. She doesn't need anything forgiving. 

[00:48:43]


>> Wendy: She looks great. Our next trend it winter white. Here it is on anne hathaway. Talk about it. 
>> You really can wear white after labor day. This is a very romanticing, frothy frock. And the key here with winter whites, we're talki off-whites. Look for warm creams and sort of icy cool blue hues looking for winter whites. 
>> Our wendy model is felicia, wearing a dress from gilt.Com in the everyday version of how the rest of us can get the winter white look. 
>> Notice this is creamy winter white. It's satin. Love the material. This dress is by laundry. You can get it on gilt.Com for $119. The original mice pryce is over $300. What we love about winter white is embellishment. Great romantic ruffles. 
>> Wendy: I love the sequin jacket, too. Thank you so much! Jane is next. The trend jane is wearing is the zoe saldanha fancy pants. Here's zoe. 
>> Here's zoe in fancy pants. When we talk about -- 
>> Wendy: Oh, my thighs are too big! I'm out. Go ahead, talk. 
>> Luckily what we're talking about, the fancy pants is the fabric. Think evening looks in sort of a dressier pant. 
>> Wendy: Come on out, jane. 
>> Yay! 
>> Wendy: She looks good. 
>> Doesn't she look fantastic? Here we've got a really jazzy printed silk pant but we're doing sort of the harem silhouette which is easy for everybody to wear. You want to look for a high waist. It really elongates the silhouette. These are by tucker, origin retail $365, but over 60% off on gilt.Com. 
>> Wendy: Cute! Our last trend is the power red dress. Let's look at power red on beyonce. They say red is the new black. 

[00:50:44]

>> How many of you want to live until you're 85 or beyond? The rest of you suicidal? 
[laughter] The fountain of youth is between your ears. It is your brain that makes the good decisions that keep you healthy, vibrant, and alive for a long time, or it is your brain that makes the bad decisions that kill you early. Your brain does not have to deteriorate. With a little forethought, you can slow or even reverse the aging process in the brain and dramatically improve everything in your life. I'm going to give you very simple steps to help you boost your brain, live longer, look younger, and dramatically decrease your risk for alzheimer's disease. I know you can do this. Now is the time to be a warrior for the health of your brain. 
[cheers and applause] 
>> female announcer: IN THIS Program, award-winning psychiatrist, brain imaging expert, and best-selling author dr. Daniel amen will show you how to boost your brain to look and feel younger every day. 
>> Thank you. I was recently on a plane when the elderly woman sitting next to me recognized me from my television shows. She leaned over and asked, "is it ever too late?" "Too late for what?" I said. "I'm 76 years old. Is it ever too late for me to have a better brain?" "Only if you just plan on living until you're 77," I said. "If you want to live until you're 90, now would be a good time to start." The fountain of youth is between your ears. It is your brain that makes the good decisions that keep you healthy, vibrant, and alive for a long time, or it is your brain that makes the bad decisions that kill you early. In this program, I'm going to give you seven very simple steps to help you boost your brain, to help you live longer, look younger, and dramatically decrease your risk for alzheimer's disease. Plus, there is a huge added bonus to having a healthier brain: Your skin will look younger too. As we will see, the exact same strategies that help your brain also help your skin look younger and more beautiful. The wrinkles on the outside may in fact spell trouble on the inside. Marianne was 59 years old when she almost quit the job she loved. She worked as a high-level business executive but was in constant pain and felt foggy-headed all day long. At first, marianne thought she was just getting older. It happened to everyone. But as marianne continued to get worse, she felt her performance would suffer and nearly resigned. This was the first time in her life that she thought her best days were behind her. Her daughter gave her a copy of my program, the same one I'm going to share with you. And to her amazement, within two months, she started to feel much better. Her pain was gone, and the brain fog had lifted. Now a year later, marianne has lost 30 pounds, and her brain feels younger, sharper, and more energized than it has in decades. Over the last 20 years, at the amen clinics, we've performed more than 70,000 brain scans on patients from 90 different countries. The brain imaging work we do has taught me that if I truly want to help people like marianne, I first have to help them understand and heal their brains. The brain imaging study we do is called spect, which looks at blood flow and activity patterns. It looks at how the brain works. Here is an example of a healthy scan. It shows full, even, symmetrical activity. The color doesn't mean anything. It's the shape that is important. Here is someone who has alzheimer's disease, where large portions of the brain are dying. The holes indicate areas of very low activity. Here is someone who had a brain injury. You can see the damage to the left front side of the brain. And here is a scan of carlos, a husband and father whose job was affected by the economy. He struggled with anxiety, moodiness, irritability, and his weight. Over the next 12 months, he worked the program and completely turned his life around. He looked better and felt better because his brain was better. Carlos, marianne, and many others have taught us that even if your brain is troubled, on the right program, you can reverse the damage and dramatically improve everything in your life. But now is the time to start. Our research clearly shows that our brains typically become less and less active with age. Now that I'm nearly 58, I hate that. As we age, the blood flow in our brain goes down, and we become much more vulnerable to memory problems, brain fog, and depression. Here is a typical 55-year-old man who has mild memory problems. And here is a typical 82-year-old brain of a woman who suffers with memory problems, low energy, and depression. Over her lifetime, she gave virtually no thought to taking care of her brain, and it shows. Now, compare her to 82-year-old dr. Doris rapp, a world-famous allergist who's taken great care of her brain. She's still practicing medicine, playing tennis, and living a remarkable life. And here is 82-year-old anna, who's has done a really great job of taking care of her brain, and she still has the energy and mental clarity of someone 30 years younger. One of the most exciting lessons I've learned from looking at all of these scans is that your brain does not have to deteriorate. With a little forethought, you can slow or even reverse the aging process in the brain, and I can prove it. Okay, let's get started. 

[00:06:48]


Step number one: You have to know about the health of your own brain. What you don't know may be hurting you. The brain imaging work we do has changed everything in my own life. Shortly after I started ordering scans in 1991, I decided to look at my own brain. I was 37 years old. When I saw the toxic bumpy appearance, I knew it wasn't healthy. All of my life, I've been someone who rarely drank alcohol, never smoked, and never used an illegal drug. Then why did my brain look so bad? Before I really understood about brain health, I had many bad brain habits. I ate lots of fast food, drank diet soda like she was my best friend, and often slept only four or five hours at night. I didn't exercise, felt chronically stressed, and carried an extra 30 pounds. What I didn't know was hurting me and not just a little bit. My last scan looks healthier and much younger than it did 20 years earlier. My brain has literally aged backwards. After seeing my original scan, I developed brain envy... 
[laughter] And wanted my brain to be better. I developed this whole program to help my brain and yours too. Here is another example. When professor andy mcgill came to see me 11 years ago, he got a wake-up call that would forever change his life. After he heard me speak about my brain imaging work and a.D.D., He brought his daughter to one of our clinics. So that she would not feel singled out, he decided to get his brain scanned as well. Andy's scan looked awful. I found out that he was having four or five drinks a day. And even though he was never drunk, the alcohol was taking a terrible toll on his brain. Plus, he was 100 pounds overweight, which, as we will see, is definitely not good for your brain. After seeing his scan, andy, too, developed brain envy and got serious about his health. Over time, he completely stopped drinking, engaged in regular brain-healthy habits, and lost the 100 extra pounds. 11 years later, his brain and his body are unbelievably better. His cardiac fitness level is now in the top 1% of people 20 years younger than he is, and his brain looks and feels dramatically younger too. When andy first saw his scan and I saw mine, we could both see that our brains were in trouble and could work a plan to make them better. How do you know about the health of your brain unless you look? You can see the wrinkles in your skin or the fat around your belly, and you can do something when you don't like how they look, but the brain is different. And unfortunately, most people never get their brains scanned or tested, and they have no idea that it is in trouble until it's too late. In the future, I think we'll get brain scans like we get colonoscopies, but they'll be a heck of a lot more fun. 

[00:10:18]


[laughter] But what can you do now to know about the health of your brain without a scan? In the program materials, I've included sophisticated tests to help you learn about the health of your brain, and then, depending on how you score, I'll give you a personalized program to strengthen your brain. For now, I've come up with several warning signs that your brain may be in trouble. See if any of these apply to you. Having a poor memory is the first warning sign, especially if it's worse than it was ten years ago. Many people think that having memory problems in their 50s AND 60s IS NORMAL, But it's not. It's a sign that your brain is struggling. How many of you want to live until you're 85 or beyond? The rest of you suicidal? 
[laughter] Did you know that 50% of people 85 years old will be diagnosed with alzheimer's disease? And with the baby boomers aging, alzheimer's is expected to triple in the coming decades, and there is no cure for it on the horizon. In fact, researchers think that alzheimer's disease actually starts in the brain 30 to 50 years before you have any symptoms. Can you see the problem here? You have no symptoms at all, but your brain is already starting to deteriorate decades before you have any signs of trouble. The woman here who was diagnosed with alzheimer's disease at age 59 likely started to show trouble in her brain by the age of 30. This person was diagnosed with alzheimer's disease in his EARLY 70s. He likely already had brain CHANGES IN HIS 40s. Losing your memory or developing BRAIN FOG IN YOUR 40s, 50s, 60s, 70s, OR EVEN 80s IS NOT NORMAL. It is a sign of trouble. A lot of people ask about the difference between alzheimer's disease and dementia. Dementia is the big umbrella category; alzheimer's disease is one of the causes. You can also lose your memory from head trauma, alcohol abuse, vascular disease, parkinson's, and other causes. All of these illnesses rob you of your memories that tell the story of your life, who you are, where you came from, what's important to you. Imagine losing it all. This is very serious. New research suggests that by doing the steps in this program, more than half of the cases of alzheimer's disease and other causes of dementia can be prevented. Depression is another very important warning sign of brain dysfunction. We all have sad days. But if the sadness comes and stays for more than a few weeks, it is critical to get it evaluated and treated. Depression doubles the risk for alzheimer's disease in women and more than quadruples it in men. Depression is also one of the treatable causes of memory loss. Matilda was diagnosed with alzheimer's disease at age 69, and she was getting worse. The dmv had revoked her driver's license after she got into four accidents. When she almost burned down her house by leaving something on the stove, five of her six children wanted to force her into a home to protect her. One of her daughters, however, had heard about my work and brought her for more testing. "You are our last hope," she told me. This is something we hear a lot. From her history, I thought matilda had alzheimer's disease too, but the results of her spect scan showed good activity in the areas of the brain usually affected by alzheimer's. Her scan was more consistent with depression. Sometimes in the elderly, it can be difficult to distinguish between the two. When I treated her depression, her memory started to get better within three weeks. After six weeks, she was much better. Everyone was so excited. At that point, matilda asked me if I would write the dmv to help her get her diver's license back. "I drive on the same highways you drive," I told her. 

[00:15:07]


[laughter] "If in six months, you're still better, I'll write the letter." Six months later, e was doing great and was able to drive for another decade. Being overweight or obese is a very concerning warning sign, as it increases the risk of depression and dementia. More than ten recent studies, including one we've published, have shown that as your weight goes up, the actual physical size and function of your brain goes down. After teri heard me talk about this, she lost 83 pounds. Her father had died of alzheimer's disease, and she had no idea that she was increasing her own chances of getting it. That really got her motivated. If you want a healthy brain, it is critical to get your weight under control now. Another warning sign is chronic insomnia or sleep apnea. Good sleep is essential to healthy brain function. Less than six hours of sleep at night is associated with lower overall blood flow to the brain. Insomnia puts you at risk for obesity and depression, and it can impair your judgment. Sleep apnea, where you snore loudly, stop breathing at night, or are chronically tired during the day, doubles a person's risk for alzheimer's disease. On scans, we often see that sleep apnea looks like ear alzheimer's disease. One of my favorite uncles acted like he had alzheimer's disease, but on testing, we found that he had severe sleep apnea, and he did much better once it was treated. 
Step number one: You have to know about the health of your brain. If you have any of these warning signs, make sure to get them evaluated and treated. 

[00:17:14]


Step number two: Start making better decisions today. The single most important factor in determining your health is not your parents or even your environment. It is the quality of the decisions that you make every day. In 1921, researchers evaluated over 1,500 ten-year-old children and then followed them over the next 90 years, looking for the traits associated with success, health, and longevity. The number one trait associated with longevity was not happiness or lack of worry. It was conscientiousness, or your ability to consistently make good decisions over a long period of time. Moderate worry, which means you care and think about the future, was especially important to staying healthy. The "don't worry, be happy" people died the earliest because they did not take their health seriously and were more likely to die from accidents or preventable illnesses such as diabetes or hypertension. So how do you improve the quality of your decisions? Here are some surprisingly simple brain-based strategies. Always keep your blood sugar stable. Low blood sugar levels are associated with lower overall blood flow to the brain, which means more bad decisions. Researchers found that drug addicts were much more likely to relapse when their blood sugar levels were low. To keep your blood sugar stable, make sure you eat high-quality food with some protein four or five times a day. There are also a number of supplements, such as alpha lipoic acid, that have been found to help balance blood sugar levels and help the brain. Get at least seven or eight hours of sleep at night. Less than six hours of sleep is associated with lower overall blood flow, which means more bad decisions. Protect your sleep at all costs. Eliminate toxins. Have you ever wondered why they serve free alcohol at casinos? 

[00:19:33]


[laughter] It's because if you drink it, you're much more likely to make bad decisions and give them more of your money. In addition, I have my patients remember the two most important words in the english language when it comes to their health: "Then what?" If I do this, then what will happen? If I say this, then what will happen? Does eating the third piece of pizza, skipping the workout, staying up late, or being a jerk to my wife help me with any of my goals? Of course not. The most effective people in life are conscientious. They know what they want, and then they act in consistent ways over time to get it. Always protect the health of your brain, and put these two words up where you can see 
them every day: "Then what?" Lastly, ask yourself why you care. What's your motivation to live long, be healthy, and to have a great brain? For me, I have a wife I adore, four wonderful children, and now five grandchildren. Plus, one of my grandchildren is sick. I need to be here to help emmy and my daughter breanne for as long as I can. If I'm not healthy, I'll never be my best for the people who need me. I never want to be a burden to my children. I want to be the leader of my family. But the only way that is possible is if I have a good brain. When I come back, I'm going to talk about how to overcome grief, loss, and depression, as these are some of the most common triggers for aging. I'll also talk about the brain-skin connection. Hold the plastic surgery until you hear what I have to say. Don't change the channel. You're going to learn how to extend the warranty on your brain and lengthen your life. 

[00:21:47]


[cheers and applause] 
>> You know it's true: The only way you can be there for the people you love is if you keep your brain in great shape. Hello, I'm greg sherwood, and I'm delighted to be here with dr. Daniel amen. Daniel, thanks so much for being with us once again and bringing us this great show. 
>> Well, thanks for having me. I love being here. 
>> I can't wait to talk to you more. You know, we're watching dr. Amen's powerful new show use your brain to change your age,but first we're asking you to support this public station with a donation that will help us bring you more informative programs like this one. And we've got some great ways to say thank you with gifts that'll help you make the most of dr. Amen's experience and advice. For example, donate $75 to receive a double dvd set that brings you the complete program we're seeing now and a bonus dv of questions and answers and interviews. Now, you can also donate $90 to receive the hardcover copy of use your brain to change your 
age: The secrets to look and feel younger every day. Or you can support us with a $250 gift to enjoy the amen clinics high performance brain master package, a great collection of tools and resources. And we're going to hear a lot more about that as we talk with dr. Amen. So, please, let us hear from you on the number right on your screen. And, daniel, it is so fascinating. I mean, your work, your life changed when you started to look at people's brains. And it's such a blinding flash of the obvious that it's the most important organ on our body and yet most of us can't see into it. 
>> Well, it's amazing. When we first started doing our brain imaging work in 1991, it just changed everything in my whole life. I mean, helped me be a better doctor because I could actually look at what was going on inside my patients' brains. So if they had depression or temper problems or marital problems or a.D.D. Or memory problems, I could see and then target treatments specifically to their brain. But it changed me because, as i talk about in the show, i totally developed brain envy. You know, I wanted a better brain, and I realized that my habits day in and day out were either helping my brain and my memory and my mood and my energy, or they were hurting it. And it's really from there that I developed this program to teach people how to boost their brains, because then when they do, everything in their life is better. 

[00:24:20]


>> And, you know, what I'm really excited about some of the elements in the master package is that what you've done is online, and with the questionnaire, you've given those of us who will never get a brain scan the tools to self-identify the issues that might be of concern to us and our brain. It's brilliant the way you've done it. 
>> Well, you know, at the clinics, we've now seen people from 90 different countries. And what I realized a long time ago is, not everyone's able to get a scan, either because they don't live near one of the clinics or because of the cost. So, based on tands of scans, I developed a series of questionnaires and tools to help people really learn about the health of their brain. And in the master package, there are great questionnaires. There's a preventing alzheimer's risk assessment. There's a questionnaire on, how is your memory? There's questionnaires on knowing about my brain, my specific brain. And then what we did is, online, we actually put tools to measure your attention, reaction time, processing speed, memory. And then, based on how you score, we'll actually give you exercises in the form of fun games to optimize your specific brain. So it goes with the first principle of this program is, you have to know about the health of your brain, because so many people have trouble and they have no idea that they're in trouble. They're 50 or 60 or even 70, and they go, "you know, my memory is no good, but that's normal." And what we've discovered is, that's not normal. That's the sign of trouble. 
>> And that's what I found really exciting and fascinating about what you say in the lecture and in the other material is that a lot of those things that we just, as we grow old, think are just inevitable parts of growing old, you are arguing quite compellingly that they're not. 
>> Well, and what we see-- we have this whole group of 80-year-old brains, and some of them, most of them, are awful because people haven't thought about their brain; they haven't taken care of their brain. But we have this whole other group of people who have stunningly beautiful brains, like I talked about in the show, and there's a reason for that. And if you engage in those kinds of behaviors that I talk about in the show and in the thank-you gifts, it can make just a dramatic difference for your life. 

[00:26:41]


>> Well, what I love, having had the chance to go to the website and see the technology and take those tests, what I ended up getting was a very customized program for me. And I thought that was great. I'm just not reading what the average person should do. I'm reading what I should do. 
>> Well, and it gives you those steps very clearly. And as I developed the master package for people, I really thought about, "well, what are the tools that you need not only for yourself"--'cause you're going to hear me say later in the show, "you need to do this with a partner. You need to do this as a family"-- "what about the tools for the other people as well?" So there's the dvd of the show that has an hour of bonus material, lots of questions and answers I did with the audience. Plus, there's an interview with my own personal trainer, because exercise is very important. Also an interview with my wife, tana. She has created for this show a wonderful brand-new cookbook called live longer with the brain doctor's wife. There's the hardcover book that comes in the package. There's an all-day seminar. I mean, it's a live seminar-- I filmed six hours--called high performance brains. I mean, who doesn't want that? And give you all the tools to have a high-performance brain. There's the questionnaires, and then there's this great online program. So why don't we look at the whole package so people can know what they have when they call in to this station and say thank you? 
>> announcer: THE AMEN CLINICS High performance brain master package contains all the tools you need to help you live longer, look younger, and boost your energy, memory, mood, and focus. It includes the two-dvd set of use you brain to change your age,which has an extra hour of bonus material; dr. Amen's latest hardcover book, use your brain to change 
your age: The secrets to look and feel younger every day; a new six-hour six-dvd course called high performance brains, exclusive to public television, that shows you how to boost your brain, energy, memory, mood, and focus while at the same time decreasing your risk for alzheimer's disease and other diseases of aging. Also included is a new cookbook from nurse and health expert tana amen which contains over 100 amazing recipes designed to boost brain function and longevity. And you will receive a one-year membership to dr. Amen's revolutionary new online program "the amen solution at home," designed specifically to boost your brain in just minutes a day. It is a $360 value and includes sophisticated tests to help you know about the health of your brain. And then, based on your scores, you will be given a specific set of exercises to enhance your memory, mood, and focus in our award-winning 24-7 brain gym. You also get your own interactive daily journal to help keep you on track. This is one of the most important tools for improving the health of your brain. Plus, you get unlimited access to the online relaxation room, where you can log on anytime to reduce stress, anxiety, and pain with our guided hypnosis and meditation sessions. Plus, there are exercises to help you eliminate the negative thinking patterns that drive depression and aging.

Just ten minutes a day on the site is all it takes to boost your brain. And you get all of these tools for a year to make your new habits part of your life for the rest of your life. 

[00:30:21]


>> Daniel, I got to congratulate you for getting so much great material into that $250 master package. So many tools that not only let you assess where you are and where your brain's at but then the really easy steps for moving from where you are to where you want to be. 
>> Well, that's really the very exciting thing for me. You know, so many people want to come to one of my clinics and get a scan, but it's not practical. So for less than about 7% of the cost of coming to one of our clinics, you get all of these great gifts plus assessment tools to know about the health of your brain and then, based on the assessment, very specific exercises to enhance your brain. So that's the exciting thing. You know, too often, you know, people have read my books and they underline them and they think about them and then they close the cover, and when they close it, they never think about it again. So that's one of the reasons i developed this onlinmmunity. I mean, there are thousands of members now on the community that really help people stay engaged to become a warrior for the health of their brain. 
>> And actually, when people do make this investment in their own brain, they're making a great investment in public broadcasting that may be the way so many of us were first introduced to you. So it's a wonderful opportunity for people to support a great place on the television dial and do something phenomenally healthy for not only their brain but the brains of their family members. 
>> Well, and it's important for public television, because it's only on public television you'll see a show like mine, where, you know, I actually have an hour longer to really teach you about how to take care of the most important organ in your body. You know, you can do a heart transplant, but you can't do a brain transplant. 
>> Well, I have to say that over the years that I've known you, I've really desperately wanted to get one of those brain scans. But now, after doing the questionnaires online and the questionnaire that comes with the master package, I really feel like I got assessed in enough of a clear way so I know what the next steps are for me and you show me exactly what to do. So I really think that that tool or that set of tools is-- for anybody who's been curious over the years of watching you or is coming--confronting issues in their life, this is a great move forward. 

[00:32:38]


>> Well, and not only can you slow or, in many cases, even reverse the aging process and decrease your risk for alzheimer's disease. In my mind, it's always about vitality and, how can I have a vibrant brain, really a high-performance brain so that my energy and memory and mood are always at the top of my game? You know, I closed this last segment talking about my granddaughter who has a pretty serious genetic disorder. And it's so important to me to be healthy so that I can be really present to love the people in my life and not be a burden on them. And I think it's just an important point for people to really be a warrior for the health of their brain because it just means so much to the people you love. 
>> And I totally agree. And what I love about your program is that people now have the tools to do that. You don't have to give up on your brain. You don't have to fall into the belief that, "okay, I'm 55. I'm 60. My brain doesn't work as well. I have no memory. I can't do the things I want to do. I'm not as sharp as I used to be." This is all changeable. 
>> Well, and that's the exciting thing. And I'm going to talk about in the next segment the big nfl study that we have been doing at the amen clinics, where we have 115 active and retired players. Some of these players are 85 years old and have been hit in the head thousands of times, but when they do this program, we often see significant improvements in 80% of them. I mean, how exciting is that, that you can take a brain that has been troubled either with trauma or a stoke or early dementia and with these interventions, you can slow the process or, in some cases, reverse it? I mean, that's what's really exciting to me. And the scans we do have been able to prove it. I mean, that's what I really like. You know, can I make your brain better? And the answer is yes, with a very smart program. 

[00:34:40]


>> And people don't have to go spend the many, many hundreds of dollars it would cost to get a scan at one of your clinics or the $700 that would be the retail value of this high performance brain master package. They jus to show their support. At that $250 level right now, they'll be supporting this station but also getting all these tools. 
>> Well, it's the perfect thank-you gift. You know, as your-- our way of saying thank you for supporting this station, we're going to help not only the station be healthy, but we're going to help your brain and your body be healthier as well. 
>> So what's coming up next? 
>> Well, I'm very excited about this segment because I'm going to talk about the brain-skin connection. You know, the things that are good for your brain also help your skin look younger and more beautiful. We're also going to talk about depression and things to do and things not to do. 
>> I mean, there's--it's hard to find something that isn't related to some--the health of somebody's brain, right? 
>> It's related to everything we do. 
>> Yeah, well, you know what? Your success and our success are really related to what you do right now, and I hope that one of the things you're thinking about doing right now is getting over to the phone and making that gift of support, because our health here at this public television station is largely dependent on those ongoing gifts that we get from not people just like you but from people just like you. You, yes, you. Now, dr. Daniel amen is our guest, and he's about to share some wonderful insights about the brain-skin connection and what not to do if you want your brain to stay healthy. So please join us back here after more of use your brain to change your ageon this public television station. 
[cheers and applause] 
>> Welcome back. Joni started attending one of the groups at the amen clinics to get healthier both physically and emotionally. After about ten weeks and ten pounds down, she told me that she went out to breakfast with her twin sister, who asked, "okay, joni, tell me the truth. Did you have a mini face-lift?" Joni said she was so surprised and flattered. "No, I promise I haven't." "Seriously?" Her twin replied. "Even my sons thought you had some work done." All joni had done was change her diet, exercise, add some high-quality supplements, and be more conscientious about her health. In the process of getting her brain scan, joni found out that she had a.D.D., Or attention deficit disorder, which shows up as low activity in the front part of the brain. The symptoms of a.D.D. Include short attention span, distractibility, disorganization, restlessness, and problems with impulse control. It explained so much to joni, including a problem she had impulsively running up her credit cards. The only plastic surgery she had, she told her sister, was cutting up all of her credit cards. 

[00:37:47]


[laughter] Joni's advice, and I agree: If you're considering pltic surgery to look younger, wait six months, do this program, and see if you still need it. As it turns out, what keeps your brain young also keeps your skin young. And even though there are no beauty contests for the brain, without a healthy brain, you'll never look your best. Anger, depression, anxiety, and brain fog all show up on your face. Getting your brain healthy will also help your skin look younger and more beautiful. In the last segment, I gave you the first two steps of my 
program: Know about the health of your brain, and start making better decisions today. 
Step number three: Avoid anything that hurts your brain. Obviously, you want to avoid brain injuries. Ur brain is soft, about the consistency of soft butter, and it is housed in a really hard skull that has many sharp, bony ridges. Past brain injuries are a major cause of homelessness, alcohol abuse, depression, anxiety attacks, suicide, premature aging, and dementia. In some studies, brain injuries have been found to double your risk for alzheimer's disease. I am very worried about all of the soldiers coming back from iraq and afghanistan who've had blast injuries who suffer with depression and memory problems. They are at a very high risk of getting early dementia. But there is hope. Captain patrick caffrey was exposed to multiple blasts while serving in afghanistan. His symptoms included intense daily headaches, irritability, and trouble with sleep, focus, and memory. He read one of my books and came to the clinic for help. His brain scan showed clear evidence of damage. On this program, all of his symptoms either vanished or dramatically improved over time. You want to protect your head at all costs. And if you've had a brain injury, take it seriously. Avoid toxins, such as illegal drugs, which are a disaster for brain function. When I first started our brain imaging work, the scans of substance abusers looked so awful. I brought them home to my children and effectively induced anxiety disorders... 

[00:40:27]


[laughter] In all of them when it came to drug abuse. Avoid much alcohol. Alcohol is not a health food. According to the harvard school of public health, alcohol-related problems are one of the leading preventable causes of death. Alcohol abuse doubles your risk of alzheimer's. And avoid environmental toxins, such as pesticides and paint fumes. Recently, todd came up to me at a lecture to show me his scan after coming to one of my clinics. Todd's brain looked awful. As I looked at his scan, todd said, "you think I'm a drug addict, don't you?" "Well, the idea had crossed my mind," I told him. "But I've never used drugs, and I don't drink. Before I came to your clinic, I used to paint my cars in my garage without much ventilation. I don't do that anymore." "Now, that is the sign of intelligent life," I told todd. New information causes you to change your behavior. Avoid anything that decreases blood flow to your brain, such as caffeine, nicotine, obesity, hypertension, heart disease, and diabetes. Anything that decreases blood flowo an organ prematurely ages it. For example, as smoking prematurely ages your skin, it is doing exactly the same thing in your brain. Avoid having low hormone levels. Thyroid, testosterone, estrogen, and progesterone are all critical hormones for brain function. Menopause in women and low testosterone in men and wome are associated with memory problems. In the program materials, i have a list of all the lab work you should have to check your hormone levels and other important numbers. Avoid too much stress or anxiety. Some anxiety is good if it helps you make good decisions, but too much has been found to kill cells in the hippocampus, the major memory center in the brain. With the high levels of stress in our country, now more than ever, it is important for all of us to have a regular stress-management practice. We published a study recently showing that a simple daily 12-minute meditation boosts blood flow to the brain and can help your memory and lower your stress. Cancer chemotherapy can also hurt the brain. How unfair is that? Obviously, you can't avoid chemotherapy if you need it, but brain fog can take a terrible toll on your quality of life. If you've had chemotherapy, it is critical to be on a brain-healthy program now. Lastly, you want to avoid spending too much time around unhealthy people. People are contagious. And if you spend a lot of time around people with bad habits, you are much more likely to have them yourself. This doesn't mean you have to get rid of all of your family and friends. 

[00:43:50]


[laughter] Stay tuned. I will talk more about how to deal with them. 
Step number four: Engage in regular brain-healthy habits. These have been found to add up to 14 years to your life. The first and most important habit is to use food as medicine. If you are not careful, the wrong food will steal your health. Last year, my sister-in-law called my wife, tana, crying. For years, tamara had been unhealthy and resistant to change. She was 5'4" tall and weighed 206 pounds. On this day, her doctor told her that she had high blood pressure, high cholesterol, very high triglycerides, and a seriously low vitamin d level. In addition, her c-reactive protein, which is a measure of inflammation, was sky-high. Tamara's doctor wanted to start her on three medications at once and told her that she was headed toward heart disease. Her knuckles were swollen and splitting, and she had no romance with her husband, no energy to play with her children, and she was unable to work. Tamara's diet was terrible. But now she was frightened enough to listen. Tana told her to start using food as medicine and to eliminate--get this--sugar, pasta, bread, dairy, soy, grains, coffee, and alcohol. Tamara said that pretty much included everything in her kitchen. 
[laughter] To make it simple, tana told her to eat like a gorilla, with lots of vegetables, some fruit, nuts and seeds, and lean protein. A week later, the swelling in her hands was gone. Within two weeks, she'd lost 14 pounds and was working full-time, and her energy was through the roof. After five weeks, tamara had lost 30 pounds, and all of her lab values were completely normal without using any medication except highly nutritious food and some targeted supplements. There is much more about brain-healthy nutrition in the program materials, including tana's new book, live longer with the brain doctor's wife. But for now, I want you to keep one rule in mind. Only put whole, high-quality food into your body and not too much of it. Think crond, which stands for calorie restricted but optimally nutritious and delicious. Calorie restriction has been shown to enhance longevity from mice to monkeys to humans. A 20-year study on monkeys found that they not only lived longer, but their brains looked younger, as did their hair and their skin. Too many calories causes waste to build up in your cells, making everything look and feel older. But in order for you to thrive, the food needs to be nutritious and taste amazing. Great nutrition is never about deprivation but always about abundance. If you had a million-dollar racehorse, would you ever give it junk food? Of course not. You are worth so much more. Foods that help both your brain and skin include omega-3 rich seafood, nuts and avocados, green tea, berries, and green leafy vegetables. Exercise is another habit to make part of your lif it pumps up your brain and makes you smarter. But the thing I find most interesting about exercise is that you don't have to go crazy with it. You just have to be consistent. I walk like I'm late for 45 minutes four times a week. The faster you can walk as you age, the less likely you are to die early. I also lift weights with a trainer for about a half an hour twice a week. Another predictor of longevity for men and women is the amount of lean muscle mass on your body. The stronger you are as you age, the less likely you are to get alzheimer's disease. Weight training also increases your metabolism and your hormones, such as testosterone and growth hormone. 18 months ago, I could barely do two pull-ups. Watch this. I have 22 pounds around my waist, and this was my fourth set. 

[00:48:49]


[applause] Not bad for an old guy. 
[laughter] One of our patients with memory problems had terrible activity in his hippocampus, which is one of the first areas of the brain to die in alzheimer's disease. It was only 4% of what it should have been. After he dedicated himself to brain-healthy habits, especially exercise, the size of his hippocampus jumped to 45%, which is 1,000% improvement. Lifelong learning is also important to keeping your brain young. Whenever you learn something new, your brain makes a new connection. When you stop learning, your brain starts to disconnect itself. But this does not mean just doing crossword puzzles. You have to use your whole brain. Just doing crossword puzzles is like going to the gym, doing right bicep curls, and then leaving. Meditation boosts the judgment part of your brain. Playing word games enhances your language centers. Memory games work the hippocampus. And learning a new dance step can activate your coordination centers. To work your brain, spend 15 minutes a day learning something new. High-quality smart supplements can also be a big help in keeping your brain and your skin young. I recommend that all of my patients take a high-quality multiple vitamin every day. B vitamins in particular have been found to help memory. I also recommend fish oil, as it decreases inflammation and helps your mood. Plus, I want you to measure and optimize your vitamin d level. You should know your vitamin d level like you know your cholesterol level. I've also found that a combination of brain-smart nutrients, such as gingko, vinpocetine, huperzine a, and acetyl-l-carnitine, can help revitalize your brain. It was this combination of supplements, together with a brain-smart program, we used to help our group of 115 active and retired nfl players who struggled with mood and memory problems. We published our study last year, and 80% of our players showed improvements in memory, mood, motivation, focus, or sleep. Here is an example. Anthony davis is the hall of fame running back from usc. He is called "the notre dame killer" because he scored six touchdowns against the university of notre dame. Anthony retired after an eight-year career in professional football. He came to see me because he saw that many of his friends had cognitive problems and he wanted no part of it. At age 54, anthony's brain looked like he was 85, and it was bad for 85. Like almost all of our players, there was clear evidence of brain trauma. On our program, anthony's follow-up brain scan looked dramatically better, and he reported that his mood, memory, and energy were better as well. These supplements worked so well for our players that I started taking them myself. 

[00:52:48]


[laughter] But for those of you who are waiting for a pill oa supplement to rescue you from your lousy lifestyle, I have really bad news for you. They never work as well as when you take them in combination with the whole program. Step number five: Treat brain problems early. There is another very important finding in the longevity 
research: People who react to a loss or illness with depression, anxiety, or drinking die earlier than others, while those who stay healthy after a period of grief get a resiliency boost and live five years longer than average. Treating brain problems early and learning how to deal with stress and loss is critical to staying healthy. Here is an example. I met chris at one of my lectures, where she told me that two years ago, she lost her 12-year-old daughter sammie to bone cancer. Chris had no idea how hard sammie's loss would hit her. She went to bed, where sammie's illness and death played over and over in her mind. Chris ate and drank as a way to cope. Most mornings, she woke up in a panic. She felt so useless and so depressed that she was secretly planning on killing herself on the two-year anniversary of sammie's death. Then chris met a friend who told her about my program. It made sense to her, and she did everything I said. She got rid of all the alcohol, ate no processed food, and began taking fish oil and vitamin d. The change was immediate. Within eight days, she felt free of the depression, and her cravings for bad food and alcohol went away. She slept through the night for the first time in years and didn't wake up in a panic. After ten weeks, she had lost 24 pounds and was running four days a week. After five months, she is down 35 pounds and lost eight inches off of her waist. Her skin is brighter, and she feels like a completely new woman. Of course, she will never forget her daughter, but there is no way sammie would have wanted her mother to be in such pain. Now she believes that sammie would be proud of her. The best time to start healing from a crisis is before it starts. Giving yourself the excuse to eat bad food, drink alcohol, or smoke p to deal with the pain only prolongs it. Never let a crisis be your excuse to hurt yourself. Whenever you feel sad, stressed, or out of control, make sure to take care of your brain first. Remember, depression is a risk factor for alzheimer's disease. It is also common with heart disease. And when it goes untreated, it more than doubles your risk of sudden death. Growing up, my grandfather was my best friend. I was named after him, and he was one of the happiest, most gentle people I've ever known. After he had a heart attack, however, everything changed. He became sad, couldn't sleep, and would start crying for no reason. In retrospect, it was clear he was suffering from depression and died shortly thereafter. His death still haunts me, because I know if someone would have aggressively treated his depression, it is likely he would have lived longer. If you or someone you love has depression, make sure to get it treated. This does not necessarily mean you have to take medication. There are good scientific studies that report taking fish oil, exercising, correcting negative thinking patterns, and targeted supplements can be effective with a lot fewer side effects. In my experience, if you follow the whole program like chris, you can feel better in a very short period of time. When we come back, I'm going to show you how to influence those you love to get healthy. I'm also going to show you a before-and-after photo that will completely blow your mind. Stay tuned.

But even the book itself, which I just finished--you realize that the lecture itself is just the top line. There's so much more great information in the book. 

[00:59:37]


>> Well, there's about ten times the amount of information in the book. And the book is really centered around ten very important stories of how people have really changed their brain and, in a sense, changed their age and changed their lives. But it gives you a very specific outline on, what are the things I need to do today to have the best brain possi 
>> so they can get the hardcover book at the $90 level. If $75 is more comfortable, they get the dvd. Now, obviously, we're watching the dvd right now, but there's a second dvd, and there's a couple of interviews on that. 
>> Well, there's an interview. So people actually saw me, in this last segment, do all those great pull-ups with with that big weight around my waist. 
>> Yeah, right, congratulation by the way. 
>> So I interviewed my trainer. And I always tell people this isn't hard. You just have to be consistent. I work out for about 35, 40 minutes twice a week. That's it. 
>> Right. 
>> You know, besides some of the walking that I do. This isn't hard, but you have to do it in a very specific, scientific, brain scientific, way. And then there's a great interview with my wife, tana, who created this new wonderful cookbook, live longer with the brain doctor's wife. And this is how we eat at my house. There are recipes for shakes. Every morning, I start the day with a great protein and vegetable shake. The stuff she puts in there-- first time she made it, I went, "i'm not drinking that. I'm not a cow." But it tasted great, and it's good for me. There are recipes for lunch and dinner. Great salads, great fish recipes. Brand-new study just came out that the more fish you eat, the bigger your brain. I mean, how exciting is that? 
>> Whoa. 
>> So she puts a lot of science along with what are brain-healthy spices that you can cook with. So it's just an amazing cookbook. I'm so blessed to have her as my partner. And in addition, there-- as you were talking about-- the six-dvd course, high performance brains. It's an all-day seminar that i taught that people paid hundreds of dollars to come and see, and it's exclusive to this package for public television. Nowhere else in the world can you get that dvd set. And people will learn how to decrease their risk for alzheimer's disease, how to decrease things like depression, how to get in physical shape but also get your brain in physical shape. In addition, a lot of people go, "well, I want a scan." 

[01:02:16]


>> Yeah, that's exactly what I did. 
>> They saw the scans of the military captain, the marine corps captain. It's like, "well, I want a scan, but I can't afford it," or, "i'm not near one of your clinics." And so, based on thousands of scans, I developed a whole series of questionnaires to help you know about the health of your brain. There's a preventing alzheimer's risk assessment. There's also a memory questionnaire. And there's a questionnaire to know specifically about the health of your individual brain. In addition, there's this whole online community that I created that will test your brain. And then there are hundreds of brain-healthy recipes. There's a food journal. There's a brain journal. There's--okay, step one through ten. These are the steps to do to get yourself healthy. It's critical. In fact, why don't we show them a rolling of the whole package so that they can see what they get when they--what they get as our gift for supporting this great station?

[01:05:29]


>> Daniel, I've got to tell you, I've had a chance to spend time in the online world that you've created in this high performance brain package. And it's just extraordinary to me that--'cause I've had envy-- I'm like everybody else who watches your shows. I wanted to get a brain scan. It's really expensive. It's not in the cards for me. But with this interactive questionnaire, the questionnaires, and the program, I really feel like I'm on track to do the things I want to do to increase the vibrancy of my brain, and it's very, very customized to me. And it's really cool that you've got the technology there to not only give me the questionnaire but then assess it and get me moving forward. 
>> Well, that's really exciting. And we have thousands of members on the site, and I get these wonderful testimonials. So I do exactly what you say. And we actually study it. If you are compliant and you do the things we ask you to do, there's a very high chance that your important numbers will get better, that your memory-- and you can take these tests over and over to go, "well, how am I doing?" So you start with the baseline, we then give you specific exercises to optimize your brain, and then you can test it again and go, "well, how am i doing?" So people can actually see the progress they make, and they can earn points, which, you know, then comes with gifts and things like that. So we're trying to use all the online technology. But in addition, you know, if somebody's, like, not--they're afraid of the computer or they don't really like it, we give them all of the other gifts, from the dvd and the book and the questionnaire on paper and the all-day seminar, to really make this information part of their life for the rest of their life. See, this is--you know, I always say my programs are never about losing ten pounds. If you want to lose ten pounds, do it somewhere else. I want you to get control of your brain and your body for the rest of your life. And over the last couple of years, I've been thinking about how important your body-brain connection are, because if your blood pressure's healthy, your brain's better. If your blood sugar is better, you brain is better. If your heart is better, your brain is better. And without a good brain, you make bad decisio, which then steal your life and they kill you early, as I talked about in the first part of the show. The number one predictor of longevity is the quality of the decisions you make throughout your life. And that comes directly from the health of your brain. 

[01:08:02]


>> And--so I don't want somebody listening to that and going, "well, jeez, I'm 55 years old. I've made so many bad decisions." It's--another bad decision would be to say it's too late to change. 
>> Well, you know, I open the show by talking about a conversation I had with a 76-year-old woman. So I'm sitting on a plane, she recognizes me from my shows, and she leans over, and she says, "is it ever too late?" And I'm like, "too late for what?" She said, "i'm 76 years old. Is it ever too late for me to have a better brain?" And what we have seen over and over--so we now have a database of 70,000 scans of patients from 90 different countries that have come to see us, and even if you're 70 and you work the program, you can have a better brain. If you're 90--in fact, you know, I have a great story of my grandmother, who was 92, who was always difficult. I always wondered, what was the matter with her? Why was she so mean? And so I actually got the chance when she was 92 to scan her, and I went, "oh, that's why she's mean," and put her on the right supplements, the right treatment for her brain, and she became, like, one of the nicest old people that I'd met. And I'm just, like, amazed. And in the questionnaire-- so we'll actually test your specific brain. So, based on thousands of scans, I developed this questionnaire to know, well, what system in your brain is working right or not so good? And then, based on how you score, I'll then give you very specific recommendations, whether it's supplements or certain kinds of exercises, to optimize your brain. And, you know, for her, her brain worked too hard, so she was rigid, worried, inflexible. Things don't go her way, she gets upset. And on some simple supplements, she just became sweet, and I'm like, "wow." 
>> Too bad you hadn't done that 40 years ago, huh? 
>> I know, 'cause my grandfather wouldn't have suffered so much. 
>> Yeah, well, that's the amazing thing is that what might be right for your brain may not be the solution for my brain because I've got a different operating system than you. 

[01:10:11]


>> You know, it's so important. One treatment never fits everyone. You have to know about your brain and then target treatment to you. So on the paper questionnaire, you can do that or online. It's really cool online because you don't have to go score anything. Automatically scores it for you and then gives you specific recommendations to your brain and then specific exercises in the form of games. I mean, they're fun games-- I love playing these games-- that are really enhancing your brain, from memory games, reaction time, attention, mood. And on the website, there's this whole relaxation room. So for people who struggle with anxiety or depression, we'll actually give them the kind of tools I use in my office day to day with people. So if people just spend ten minutes a day on the website and they do it for a couple of months, it's like spending a year seeing me twice a week. You get the exact same tools that I use in my office that would cost people thousands of dollars. And this way, they can do it in the privacy of their own home. They don't have to get in the car. They don't have to wait in a waiting room for someone. 
>> And they can do it when they have the time. 
>> And they can log on 24 hours. The food recipes they like, the brain games that they like, the relax--in the relaxation room, there's five individual hypnosis audios that I do for them: One for anxiety. One for sleep. I get so many letters where people go, "i love going to bed with you every night," and my wife doesn't object, 'cause I'm at home. So sleep, there's one for pain, for people who struggle with pain, another one for weight, and another one for high performance. 
>> Man, there are so many things going on here, daniel. I just want to let people know that the one thing we'd like your brain to be doing right now is quickly calculating the incredible value that this package would bring into your life and how important your gift to us, to this public station is right now, whether you join at the $75 level to take advantage of getting the dvd of the program we're enjoying now plus the extra dvd with the interviews and the question and answers or you move up to the $90 level to get dr.

[01:12:39]


level to get every element: The DVDs, THE BOOK, BUT ALL THESE Other elements that daniel's been outlining and this extraordinary opportunity to be in this community you have created. It really is one of the most phenomenal online experiences I've ever had anywhere just because it's so rich and it's so customized. 
>> Well, let's take a look at it one more time. So let me show a woman actually on the online community working through the different exercises. 
>> announcer: AS PART OF THE Package, you will receive a one-year membership to dr. Amen's revolutionary online program, "the amen solution at home," designed specifically to boost your brain in just minutes a day.

>> I just--i have to say again, I just--i had so much fun the last couple of days playing in this world that you've created 'cause I really felt I was doing the right thing for me. And the fact that you've created a community, I feel like I'm having a shared experience. I'm not doing this all by myself. You're there helping out, along with a lot of other people. 

[01:14:54]


>> Well, and we have coaches, my coach that helped me get the body that I have, that I'm, you know, excited about. My wife is a coach with great food. There are other coaches.

There's a lot of exciting things coming up. 
>> Well, there's a before-and-after picture and a before-and-after story that'll really just blow your mind. So for all of you that have tried and failed, this story inspires me every day. I'm also going to talk to you about a great program that I've been doing with a huge organization, and the results are just phenomenal. So a lot of great things coming up. 
>> There's not really one thing that you talk about that not any one of us cannot do. That's what's great about this. 
>> It's very easy. 
>> It's very easy, and I hope you realize that. The other easy thing for you to do is to get right on over to the phone and make that gift of support, because by doing that, you're improving the health and vitality of this organization, an organization I know you tune in to on a regular basis. And we're going to hear more from dr. Amen as his program continues, but we'd also love to hear from you with that contribution that will keep our service going strong. So please do your part after more of use your brain to change your ageon this public television station. 
[cheers and applause] 

[01:16:58]


>> Welcome back. 18 months ago, steve was 40 years old and weighed 630 pounds. He was struggling with depression and a 25-year addiction to alcohol and nicotine. He suffered with sleep apnea, hypertension, diabetes, and chronic pain in his feet that tortured him day and night. He was so big that whenever he fell, one or two people could never get him up, and he would have to call 911 for a team of people to help him. At the time, he was thinking of suicide, but he could not get up the stairs to get his gun. His sister saw me on tv and got him a copy of my program, which he followed religiously, and over the next 18 months, steve lost over 380 pounds, all without any surgery. In addition, steve has gone from ten medications to two, and he's lost his pain, diabetes, alcohol, cigarettes, and depression. Not only does steve look and feel dramatically younger, but his brain is younger as well. He has better focus, energy, and memory. Ultimately, steve used his brain to change his age, and in the process, he saved his life. So what was steve's secret to success? He started by making better decisions. He avoided anything that hurt his brain, including alcohol and bad food. He engaged in regular brain-healthy habits, like exercise and new learning. And even though he was 630 pounds, he started by dancing in his chair to music. Plus, he learned as much about his health as possible. He ate only whole, high-quality food and not too much, took brain-smart supplements, and he checked his important numbers. You need to know your vitamin d level, thyroid, and testosterone levels. All of these were low for steve. In fact, his testosterone level was so low, his doctor actually measured it three times. By getting his blood work balanced, he felt so much better and was able to stay on the program. Plus, steve never saw this as a diet. He saw it as changing his life for the rest of his life. The first three letters in the word "diet" are "die." Diets don't work long-term. I want you to get control of your brain and your body for the rest of your life. That is the only way you will truly decrease your risk of getting alzheimer's disease and the her diseases of aging. If steve can use these principles to get healthy, I know you can too. In this segment of the show, I will talk about the last two steps of how to use your brain to change your age. 

[01:20:14]


Step number six: To be the most successful, you have to help someone else change. Doing this program with a partner is the secret to long-term success. Steve was masterful in eliciting social support, and he is now one of the coaches on our online community. He stays healthy by helping other people change. I had an experience last year that was very disturbing. I went to my own church one sunday and watched them serve such bad food to the 
congregation: Doughnuts, sausage, bacon, hot dogs, cupcakes, and ice cream. And I wondered if they were trying to send people to heaven... 
[laughter] Early. 
[laughter] I was so upset that day that i prayed god would use me to help change churches be healthier places. Then--no lie--two weeks later, pastor rick warren called me from saddleback church. 
[applause] He asked if I would help get his church healthy. Saddleback is one of the largest churches in america with ten campuses across southern california. Pastor warren is the author of the purpose driven life, which was the world's best-selling book four years in a row. "Wow," I thought, "now, that is an answer to prayer." Pastor warren said that when he heard me talk about how when your weight goes up, the size of your brain goes down, that convinced him that he and his congregation had to get healthy. Together with my friends dr. Mehmet oz and mark hyman, we developed a 52-week program called "the daniel plan." It launched in january 2011, and to date, we have over 15,000 participants. So far, the results have been stunning. In the first six months of the program, the churches lost over 200,000 pounds. And people report improved energy, focus, memory, sleep, and mood, plus reductions in pain, stress, blood pressure, diabetes, and many medications. The plan is filled with great content, but the secret sauce is that it is centered around a small-group format, where five to eight people meet weekly to support each other. We have leveraged one of the most effective tools for change, the power of human connection. When you make a commitment to walk or work out with someone else, you're much more likely to show up. If you really want to change, teach someone else how to do it. Your relationships have a dramatic impact on your health. And for people who really want to be healthy, associating with other healthy people is the strongest and most direct path to change. This doesn't mean you have to give up your friends who are struggling with their health. Share this program with them and offer to do it together. Right now, I want you to think of the people you love most in this world. Who do you call when something good happens or when something bad happens? For me, I call my wife, my parents, and my children. For each of these people, ask yourself, are you their friend or their accomplice? A friend is someone who helps their loved ones be successful, while an accomplice is someone who helps them maintain their bad habits. "Oh, come on, it'll be fine. It's just one more time. I cooked for you all weekend. Have more. Don't be a party pooper. It's the weekend. You've worked hard. You've earned it." Are you helping those you love prevent devastating illnesses like alzheimer's disease and depression? You can lead the change in your family. Fatima learned about my program through her work. At the time, she was encouraging her husband to get healthy, but like many husbands, rob was not paying attention. He was 44 years old and had back problems, arthritis in his knees, insomnia, and a sluggish memory. After knee surgery, his doctor told him that he would never run again. His father had his first heart attack at age 40 and died at 58. In addition, their boys, ages and 13, were both struggling in school. As fatima watched my programs, rob and the boys decided to join her. Since then, everything in their family has changed, from their diet to their activity level to making smarter choices. After just a few short months, rob's pain was gone, and he has just finished his second triathlon this year, both times, coming in first for his age group. He's lost 39 pounds, and his sleep and memory are better. At work in a meeting recently, he was able to come up with the name of a client they had seen 12 years earlier. Both children also perform better in school. For one of the boys, all seven of his teachers noticed a dramatic improvement, and he BROUGHT HOME STRAIGHT "A"s. When you get the message in this program, it changes everything in your life and in the lives of those you love. For your friends and family who are resistant to change, give them a copy of this program. When people see the brain scans, they develop brain envy, and getting healthy becomes much more important to them. Step number seven: Never stop being a warrior for the health of your brain. I recently met a woman who told me that now that she's 60 years old, she doesn't want to have to worry anymore about what she eats and exercising. If that is you, you just want to make sure you're okay with the consequences of having an

older brain: Less energy, brain fog, depression, and more bad decisions. As we age, we have less room for error. To be better, you have to constantly be vigilant for your health and not let others steal it. There are so many forces in our society that are against us, from our churches serving toxic food to the explosion of fast-food restaurants. According to timemagazine, 75% of our health care dollars are spent on preventable illnesses, illnesses that are caused mainly by a lack of conscientiousness and many bad decisions. I want to share one more important strategy with you today. I want you to stop lying to yourself. How you think dramatically affects how you feel and every decision you make. And the lies you tell yourself are one of the biggest factors that drive aging. Here are some of the common little lies I hear that make people old, fat, depressed, and feebleminded. "My memory is no good. That's just normal as you get older." No, it's a big sign of trouble. "My dad is 92. We can't do much for him now." I hate this lie. I've seen people 100 years old improve on the right strategies. "I can't eat healthy because I travel." I'm always amused by this one, because I travel a lot. It just takes a little forethought and planning, conscientiousness. "My whole family gets alzheimer's disease. It's in my genes." This is one of the biggest lies. Genes account for only about 20% to 30% of your health. The vast majority of health problems are driven by the bad decisions you make. My genes, too, say I should be fat, but I don't make the decisions now that make it likely to happen. "I can't afford to get healthy." Being sick is always more expensive than getting healthy. "I can't find the time to work out." You'll have plenty of time when you're dead. "It's easter, memorial day, july fourth, labor day, thanksgiving, christmas, friday, saturday, sunday, monday." There is always an excuse to hurt yourself. When you stop believing these lies, the quality of your decisions and your health go way up. I gave you two words that are critical to your health: "Then what?" If I do this, then what will happen to my health? I want to give you one more 

[01:29:35]


word: "Now." So many people keep telling themselves they'll get serious tomorrow. I know. I said that to myself for about 30 years. I'll start monday, next month, january 1st, when I turn 40, 45, 50. Tomorrow never comes, and when I discovered that my own brain was not healthy and that alzheimer's disease starts 30 to 50 years in the brain before people have any symptoms, i realized I don't have tomorrow, and neither do you. Now is the time to get healthy. You literally have no time to wait. Now is the time to get your brain tested to get a baseline on how it functions. Now is the time to start making better decisions. Now is the time to avoid anything that hurts your brain and to engage in regular brain-healthy habits. Now is the time to get any brain problems treated and to do this program with a partner. And now is the time to be a warrior for the health of your brain. I want to close by asking you two very simple questions. 
One: If you don't do the program as I outlined it, if you just keep doing what you've always done, what will your life look like in a year, in fivars, in ten years? I want you to imagine your brain continuing to get old and all that goes with that. 
And two: If you do the seven simple steps in the program, what will your life look like in a year, in five years, in ten years? Smart people think ahead. I want you to imagine yourself with better energy, a brighter mood, healthier skin, and a younger brain. I know you can do this and be like marianne, who got her brain back and kept the job she loved; carlos, who looks and feels better; andy, who dramatically reversed the aging process in his brain; teri, who decreased her chances of getting alzheimer's disease; chris, who overcame her grief; and steve, who literally saved his life. I am rooting for your success. With a brain-smart plan, I know that you, too, can slow or even reverse the aging process in the brain, making you look and feel younger every day. May god bless you. I'm dr. Daniel amen. 

[01:32:16]


[cheers and applause] 
>> Hey, we all know how easy it is to put things off, but if you've gotten a wake-up call from this program, now is the time to be a warrior for the health of your brain. Hello again, I'm greg sherwood, and once again, dr. Daniel amen is with us to remind you that now is also a great time to support public television with a donation that says thanks for this program. Daniel, once again, great to have you here helping us raise some money for public broadcasting and hearing more about this fantastic program. 
>> Well, I'm so excited to bring it tpublic television viewers, because it's only on public television you'll see a show like this one. 
>> And I think that's why we deserve your support. Dr. Amen is here, obviously, to share more of his insights. And you know what? You can revisit this program with our gift at the $75 gift level. You'll get the double dvd edition of use your brain to change your age. Now, if you can give a gift of $90, you can receive the hardcover copyhis book that details all the things that he went out in a great deal more detail about this program for enhanced brain health. But if you can see your way to supporting us with a gift of $250, we'll send you the amen clinics high performance brain master package. Along with the dvd and the book, you'll receive a cd-rom cookbook, a six-dvd course that can help you understand and develop a high-performance brain, a questionnaire that you can use to gauge your own brain's health, and a one-year membership "the amen solution." This is an online program. It's really an online world that you can enter to help keep your brain fit. Now, we're going to hear more about all these gifts, so please make your call now. And join us then back here as i spend a few short more minutes with dr. Daniel amen. We're getting down to the wire here. People have now heard the entire lecture. I think people should be excited about the opportunity. But as you said in the show, now is time. 

[01:34:27]


>> Well, it's absolutely essential. People keep putting things off. You know, "i'll do it when I'm 40, 45, 50," and, you know, pretty soon, tomorrow never comes. Now is the time to make that decision to change, because what you can see in a very short period of time that your energy will be better; your mood will be better; your memory will be better; even your skin can be better by doing the things that I outline in the course. And none of these things are hard. You know, as I've gone through these seven steps, none of them are hard. You just have to do it in a brain-smart way. And in addition, it makes a great gift, because if you give the gift of brain health to those you love, they also become your support community. Because, you know, as I talked about it in the show, people get better together. So I was at another station, and a 91-year-old woman called in, and she ordered six packages, for all six of her kids, because she said, "we're going to do this together." I mean, can you imagine a better gift to give someone than the gift of brain health and the gift of getting your family healthy or the people in your church or the people at work? And it's not hard. Here you have all of the tools to do that. From the dvd of the show, that's a great place to start. You have someone who's resistant in your life, show them the dvd of the show. People see the scans, and they get brain envy. They want a better brain. Get them the book, because the book just has ten times the information. Or what you really can do is the whole package that you can share in your community. There's a paper and pencil questionnaire that you can give to everybody to know about the health of their brain. So let's go to see all of the elements of the package that you get as a gift from us when you support this amazing station. 

[01:36:38]

[01:38:48]


>> You know, daniel, I'm amazed that you put that whole package together for a gift to this public station of $250, which is a good chunk of change, but the retail value of the whole package nominally is $700. But if this changes somebody's life or many people's lives, it's incredibly priceless. 
>> Well, and I get letters and emails, and when people see me in the airports, they tell me how this information has changed their lives. I mean, that's what keeps me going. I love that part. But it is priceless for them not only if it helps change their life, but if you change your life, if your habits are better, that influences your husband or it influences your wife, it influences your children and influences your parents, those people that you work with, you're really creating your own support community of brain health, which, you know, it's not just brain health. It's every kind of health. You know, you're healthy physically, emotionally, spitually, intellectually because your brain is better. But you need support. There's this great study out of stanford where they looked at people over 90 years, and one of the big predictors of longevity wae health of the people you spend time with. 
>> Oh, yeah. 
>> So if you spend time with healthy people--so why not be smart and create your own brain-healthy community? And here I give people all the tools that they need, from the dvd and the book, the questionnaires, this six-dvd course. This is an all-day course. People paid hundreds of dollars to come to hear me live all day. 
>> And this is the whole day? 
>> This is the whole day, six hours on how to create a high-performance brain. And this is exclusive to public television. So I'm not letting them out anywhere else for the next few years, because I love public television. You know, I'm a member of my local public television station, and you should be too, because itnly on public television you'll see a show like this. So you want to be part of the public television support community, we need your sut now more than ever, but this will also help you. I mean, share it with your family and your friends. And, you know, speaking of community, I talked about this big program I'm doing with saddleback church. 

[01:41:18]


>> I know, with pastor warren and the saddleback, yeah. 
>> And I love it. You know, saddleback's one of the largest churches in the world, and a lot of churches are not healthy. You know, they're trying to get you healthy spiritually, where I'm saying, "you're trying to send people to heaven early. You know, this is not a good thing." And when I said that prayer and pastor warren called me, I'm like, "thank you." And we have made such a difference in the health of this church. Now they've lost 250,000 pounds, and the stories are just unbelievable. In fact, in the hardcover book, there's a whole chapter i dedicate to "the daniel plan" and pastor warren and his story and the church's story. And one of the women came up to me, and over this last year, she's lost 90 pounds. And she said she did it because she wanted to avoid the dinosaur syndrome. So in the book, I talk about the dinosaur syndrome. 
>> This was something that really inspired pastor warren too, right? 
>> Inspired him because what we found is, as your weight goes up, the actual physical size and function of your brain goes down. And I'm like, "whoa." When I read that first study, I lost 30 pounds. I'm not having a smaller brain. But teri had a father who had alzheimer's disease. And she came up to me recently, and she said, "you know, I knew I was fat, and I knew I was ugly, but I thought I was smart, and I had no ithat my own behavior was putting me at risk to get alzheimer's like my dad." And the transformation that she has made over this past year, losing 90 pounds--so she looks great, feels great, and at the same time, she's decreasing the age of her brain and decreasing the risk that she's going to get alzheimer's disease. And that's how I hooked pastor warren. I talk about this in the book. He said, "you know, I've been on hundreds of diets." And he said, "you know, getting well for my heart just never did it for me. Getting well to live longer? I'm going to heaven." He said, "to be sexier? Look at me." He said, "but when you said the health of my brain was going to deteriorate and I wasn't going to be as smart," he said, "that hooked me." And the same tools that we used at saddleback church, they're on the online community, because it's critical to get better together. And we have thousands of people on the community now, brain warriors, people who want a better brain and a better body, and you can do that too. So let's see a small clip of the online community that people get when they get is master package. 

[01:44:01]


>> announcer: AS PART OF THE Package, you will receive a one-year membership to dr. Amen's revolutionary online program, "the amen tion at home," designed specifically to boost your brain in just minutes a day. It is a $360 value and includes sophisticated tests to help you know about the health of your brain. And then, based on your scores, you will be given a specific set of exercises to enhance your memory, mood, and focus in our award-winning 24-7 brain gym. You also get your own interactive daily journal to help keep you on track. This is one of the most important tools for improving the health of your brain. Plus, you get unlimited access to the online relaxation room, where you can log on anytime to reduce stress, anxiety, and pain with our guided hypnis and meditation sessions. Plus, there are exercises to help you eliminate the negative thinking patterns that drive depression and aging. And through "the amesolution at home," you'll also have access to an interactive community of thousands of people dedicated to brain health and get ongoing support and much, much more. Just ten minutes a day on the site is all it takes to boost your brain. And you get all of these tools for a year to make your new habits part of your life for the rest of your life. 
>> So, daniel, again, I want to emphasize to people, because i think this is such an incredible opportunity, having spent some time in that community and in that world, getting a customized assessment of my own brain and customized exercises to do, it's just so phenomenal that there's a community there; there is a resource there. Now, the nominal value if I was to go out and just join that would be $360 just for the online community, not the book, NOT THE DVDs. So what's neat here is, for $250, they're getting everything and an entire year of that extraordinary community you've created. 
>> Well, and I did that so that people would call and support their public television station, because when you do that, you're telling public television that you like shows like mine, and then we can go create more shows. But I wanted to eate the maximum value, because I'm really interested in creating warriors for the health of their brain, that you can create your own community. That's really what I want for you. I want you to create your own community of healthy people, because if you get brain-he that will affect your spouse, it will affect your children, your grandchildren, and people that you love. And, you know, the health of our country is going the wrongay. 

[01:46:44]


>> Exactly. Right, I think we are all aware of that, right? 
>> But individuals can make a big difference, but they start where they are. Get themselves healthy, their families healthy, and then it just spreads from there. We need to create this movement, which is why I tried to create this value at a great price, so that people could afford it and then share it. 
>> Well, you know what? You said something very poignant to me. You talked about how you want to be alive and as vital as possible for the people in your family. I have somebody in my family who's struggling with alzheimer's, and when you see what that's like and what it does to somebody, you don't want to go there, and you realize you don't want to be--as you said at the last part of the talk, you dowant to be a burden to your family like that if you can possibly help it. And if this is a way out or a way of fending that off so you're a vital member of the community, you're a supportive member of the family and not a burden, what a gift. 
>> Well, and so many people are in denial. You know, "that's not me. I can work on this later." But when you really see alzheimer's disease up close, it's a nightmare. And I want people--and i specifically wrote this show to raise people's anxiety, because what we discovered is, some anxiety is good. It's important. The "don't worry, be happy" people, they die the earliest. If you're concerned about the health of your brain, good. Now is the time to get it looked at, to get it tested. And not everybody can come to one of my clinics and get a scan, so that's why we developed these great assessment tools online and in the paper and pencil questionnaires that we get, so you know where you're starting from. And then we'll give you very specific exercises to work your brain. 'Cause as we were talking about, not everybody's brain's the same. You need to have a personalized program for you, which is exactly what we're going to give you, a personalized program to you. And it's fun. And, you know, getting rid of the bad food in your life, what you find is, in this cookbook, there is over a hundred, like, really delicious recipes. I am all about abundance. I hate deprivation. I only want great food in my life, but we'll show you exactly how to do that. None of this is about depriving yourself. It's about so you can have vibrance and vitality. You know, I had to get rid of the deprivation mind-set, "you know, I'm just going to be eating celery and carrots." I happen to like celery and carrots, but it's like, this is so much better. You know, I had a vegetable soup last night that was just incredible. Or there's a bison meat loaf that will just knock! Your socks off. There are soy-- or goji berry truffles. I mean, it's like, "you're kidding." I can eat better than before. And when you get rid of all the bad things in your diet, your taste buds now become alive, and your cravings don't taunt you anymore. My cravings used to taunt me as I'd walk by the refrigerator. 

[01:49:50]


>> Right. 
>> So from food to exercise to better memory to looking better in your clothes--i'm totally vain. You know, I like the fact that i look better, that I'm at the same weight as I was when I'm 18, and I have the same muscle mass. I like that, but what I'm doing, I'm really not exercising for my butt. I'm exercising for my brain, because with a better brain, i can fulfill the mission I have in my life to share this, but i can also be a good husband. I can be a good father. I can be a good granather, which-- you know, now I have five grandkids--is so vital. It's important to me. 
>> I think it's just wonderful. And I was taken by that story that you started the last segment. Steve, 650-pound young man who lost literally half of his weight, and he doesn't think of it as a diet. I just thought that was an extraord--he thought of it as a way to change his life and to get a life back. 
>> For the rest of his life. He literally saved his life. So if you have been bad to your body, if you have been bad to your brain, there is hope. I mean, if you look at steve's story-- he lost 380 pounds, my goodness. No surgery, no drugs. He went from ten medications to two. Pair that with the nfl study we did, where we saw many people who had brain damage. And after just a couple of months on the program, we saw 80% improvement in our players, in their memory, in their mood, in their sleep, their motivation. You can do this. None of this is hard. That's why I am so excited to share it, especially on public television, because your gift of support, we will give you great tools to literally change your brain, and when you do, you change your body and your life. 
>> And this is an opportunity, as the wind-down with our time together, for people to really help this station as well. You know that this station exists largely because people just like you make the effort to make that gift of support. In this case, I encourage you to do it for us so we can continue to be here for you, but to do it for yourself, because your gift--particularly at that level of the $250 level or all the tools we've been talking about--but if $75 makes more sense for you, please come in at that level and know that not only will you get the dvd of the lecture that we just enjoyed. You're going to get an entire second dvd with some great interviews and lots of q&a. Lots of questions you probably have on your mind right now will be answered. Move up to the $90 level, and you can get the book, which i just finished reading yesterday. And what it shows you is, there's so much more to know. This lecture, as fascinating as it was, there's tons more information, lots more background and details in the book. And of course, you get the book AND THE DVDs IF YOU COME IN AT The $250 level. And that's really the one that excites me, daniel, only because I've been on the online environment now for a few days, and it's just so cool and so much fun. And I think anybody who's seen what you do wants to have that customized insight about their own brain, and that's what you provide for us. 

[01:53:10]


>> Well, and you want to be a part of the online community, because it will test your brain, and then, based on how you score, we'll give you very specific exercises in the form of games to enhance your brain. So there's our 24-7 brain gym, but that's not all. There's a relaxation room. So if you're feeling anxious or if you're feeling stressed or you can't sleep, you can log on anytime and listen to the hypnosis downloads. You can play the relaxation games. There's a room I call "THE KILL THE A.N.T.s ROOM." A.N.T.s STANDS FOR AUTOMATIC Negative thoughts, the thoughts that come into your mind and just ruin your day. And these negative thoughts drive aging, and they drive depression, and we teach you how to kill them. There's lots of great exercise. There's a food journal, an exercise journal. There's a brain journal. And these three journals, they don't take long, but they have been shown to double weight loss in just ten weeks, so they're these great tools. I'll tell you what numbers that you should get, you know, what lab values you should get, why you should, what's a good value, what to do with it if it's out of whack. All of these tools--it's a $360 value, and you get it as part of the master package, which is $250. So it's less than $1 a day, much less than $1 a day, for the health of your brain. But in addition, you get the dvd of the show. So a lot of people saw the show, but, you know, they may have come in late. Here you get the whole show that you can show to your family, you can show to your loved ones. This is--it's a great gift. And a lot of people have questions. Well, I stayed around for an hour with the audience, and I answered questions from the audience. Then I did an interview with my wife, tana, on creating brain-healthy families, an interview with my personal trainer on, "how did you transform my body? How can people do this in a sile way?" And in addition with the big package, my brand-new book, use your brain to change your age, that has about ten times the information, so you can underline it, go back to it, read it over and over again, and then share it. There's this great cookbook. And this is important because it gives you all the recipes you need that are with spices to enhance brain function. So, like, sage has high-level scientific evidence that it improves your memory. Cinnamon helps with focus. So tana goes into all of those things, and the recipes ar amazing. Then exclusive to public television, you get the six-dvd course. You're with me all day, going through how to decrease your risk for alzheimer's disease. "How do I know about my brain? What if I'm anxious? What if I'm sad? What if I'm rigid? What if I can't concentrate?" I go through all of these things. Plus, there's this great questionnaire to know specifically about the health of your brain. 

[01:56:09]


>> And what I want to let people know is, we are getting right down to the wire. We have less than a minute to go. So I want people to get to that phone right now. Pick the level that makes sense to you, knowing that every dollar that you gift to us will be put back into the works here, delivering great programs for you. This is your public television station. Dr. Daniel amen, thank you so much for making this program and bringing it to us. Any brief words of wisdom you'd like to share? 
>> Well, you know, I play this game with my daughter: Is this good for my brain or bad for my brain? You want to play that. And supporting this public television is so important so I can bring you more shows. 
>> Thank you, dr. Daniel amen. And of course, we want to thank everybody who called with a contribution during this break. Now stay with us for more of the programs your donations make possible on this PUBLIC TELEVISION STATION.erDEMATEO Family.
