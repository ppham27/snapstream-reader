Becky, how you doing? Hello. I'm doing well. Cooking frogs legs is sometimes more difficult than cooking fish, as a protein. It overcooks only seconds, it goes dry. So it's a very delicate, dainty protein. Right. Understand it properly. Okay. What are you doing? I'm gonna do confit potatoes. Then I'm going to do pan-fried frog legs with garlic and butter, and just make a little fresh salad. Good luck. Thank you, chef. She's awesome. (Graham) All right, guys, 15 minutes to go. [cheers and applause] Oh, man, that's good. [sizzling] Christine, becky, josh, only two of you are going into the masterchef final. Come on. All right, guys. Come on, christine. Joe, who's going home tonight? I think that if becky can really kind of ramp it up again, I think christine might be a bit in jeopardy because josh is like a freight train full of speed right now. [cheers and applause] You're all coming into your last ten minutes. Come on. The lamb has been cooking for a long time, and it should be cooked by now. I'm running out of time. See if it's ready. Is that cooked, josh? I'm gonna see. No. Oh, my goodness. Yeah it's cooked. I don't know how that guy pulls it out of the bag. I won't have time to let it cool and shred it, so I'm just gonna have to chop it up, stuff it in the yuca, and fry it. Come on, josh. Snap, this is like my tortellini. Hurry, josh, hurry. Every moment counts. Let's go. Focus. 2 1/2 minutes to go. Come on! Go, chris! Come on, guys. Whoo! (Gordon) Remember what's at stake. Oh, wow, christine-- christine, it looks delicious. Thanks, guys. 

[00:02:00]


How's becky doing? She's kicking butt, man. Come on, josh. I'm letting it fry till the last possible moment. I don't know if I'm gonna make it. Come on, 59 minutes gone, one minute to go! FRY [bleep]! Ugh! Josh, you've got to plate. Get 'em out, big man. Get 'em out. [cheers and applause] (Gordon) Ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one. And stop! [cheering] (announcer) Are you the next masterchef? We'll be coming to a city you soon. Go to fox.Com and apply for season four now. set? I've got two tickets to para! Pack your bags, we'll leave tonight. Uhh, it's next month, actually... EDDIE continues singing: Two Tickets to... Paradiiiiiise! No four. Remember? Whoooa whooaa whooo! You know Ronny, folks who save hundreds of dollars by switching to GEICO sure are happy. And how happy are they Jimmy? Happier than Eddie Money running a travel agency. Get happy. Get GEICO. Fifteen minutes could save you jifteen percent or more.

(Gordon) Ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one. And stop! Well done! (announcer) In the final elimination challenge, all three home cooks will each make one dish, with the best two moving into the grand finale. You are about to find out the consequences of win will be going on to the mastercheffinale. For one of you, you've just cooked for the very last time inside the masterchef kitchen. We cannot wait to taste these amazing dishes. Christine, let's go. Yeah. All right, christine! [cheers and applause] [chuckles] Fried chicken? THIS [bleep] BETTER BE Amazing. Right. What is it? Um, I did, like, a southern-style buttermilk-battered fried chicken with creamed kale. Yeah, what can you do with a drum? I mean, you can't bone it out, you can't stuff it. It has to be fried, roasted. Christine, to get you into the final, this had better be a bloody good fried chicken, let me tell you. So the seasoning around the chicken is what? Paprika, cayenne, thyme, and sage, and blood orange. Christine, it's delicious. The seasoning is absolutely perfect. Thank you. It's got the heat in there. It's crispy. It's moist inside, and it's cooked perfectly. I love it. I was a bit nervous about the blood orange aspect, especially that sort of fragrant blood orange. Thank you, chef. What would I change? A little less cream in then kale. Okay. 'Cause you've got the tomatoes and the onions, and with that cream in there, it's almost over-masked. Okay. But the fried chicken was delicious. Thank you, chef. Modern home comfort food. I mean, only you could glamorize a drumstick. Let me tell you. Thank you. 

[00:08:29]


Christine, how you doing? I'm nervous. Smells good. You're making us jealous up here. That's delicious. Thank you. It's cooked perfectly. Being able to use blood orange, buttermilk-- trying to impart some acidity that comes from the zest-- it really works with the spices that you chose. Thank you. I would say the only thing that I would do to change the greens is less of that creaminess. The chicken is absolutely badass. Good job. Thank you, chef. [cheers and applause] As far as the fried chicken goes... It's quite good. Thank you. It's crunchy, it's moist on the inside. The kale's cooked well. They way you blanched it, and I saw you put it in ice. It's got a perfect crunch to it. It's got a nice consistency. Um, but it's just too creamy. Could you taste the ratio when you put it in your mouth how much--how creamy that kale is? Actually, I was pulling the kale out, and when I was plating it, I was trying to strain the cream out. So you know there's too much cream ithere? Uh, well, now I know. But you knew that when you plated it. Mmm... So you didn't taste it? So my fried chicken gets pretty rave reviews from all three judges, so I'm really happy about that. But my creamed kale, they say, is too creamy, so I am worried that the creamed kale could send me home. (Graham) All right, coming up next, the person that had the second pick of the legs. That is josh. [cheers and applause] Come on, josh! Damn, this is a sexy plate. This is the kind of dish 

[00:10:29]


that becky should be taking pictures of. What did you make? I made a leg of lamb carimanolas with mango salsa, tomato salsa, and a tomatillo salsa. We're cooking to get into the finale. You pick a leg of lamb, and then you bring me this. This is the last recipe in the last page in the last chapter of the lamb cookbook. Hmm. It's so risky. Yuca, starchy-- difficult to work with. Braising lamb in under an hour. Why take all those risks? I felt like I could do it. I've never eaten anything quite like this. It's crispy, without being doughy, and your lamb is tender, your sauces are pure. They scream of their ingredients. Once again, josh, you've astounded me. Nice. Because this is really quite delicious. Thank you. Congratulations. Good job. Thank you, chef. [cheers and applause] Kill it. Straight off the bat, visually, I think it's beautiful. Nice crunch on the outside. They're nice, they're consistent, and the sauces are rockin', this is really, really good, josh. I'm proud of you for being able to put that up. Good job. Thank you. And the three sauces? Salsa roja with tomatoes, red chile peppers, garlic, and curry. Salsa verde, tomatillo, poblano, jalapeno, lime, and cilantro, and mango. 

[00:12:31]


Have you been to panama? I have. Yes. You have? I mean, growing up, my dad used to take me down there. He had a house, and he used to make me eat. He used to knock coconuts down from the tree and make me drink the water, and I hated it. I was, like, a hot dog and chicken nuggets kinda kid. Josh, it's delicious. The three sauces are very clever. Your father from panama, right now, would be incredibly proud. Great job. Thank you. [cheers and applause] Yes. Good job, josh. [chuckles] Damn. (Joe) And finally... Becky, step forward, please. [cheers and applause] (Becky) Josh got a really great review, and christind okay, so I'm hoping that mine's better than christine's. What did you make? Garlic-butter fried frogs legs with confit potatoes, mushrooms, and a bitter green salad. I ally, really, really want to be in the final two, and I think I deserve it, and I know that i-- I could create some amazing food in this finale. And I just want that opportunity so bad. claims. flo. I need you. I feel so alone. But you're not alone. I knew you'd come. Like I could stay away. You know I can't do this without you.

[00:17:32]


Had you had the choice, would you have picked frogs' legs? No. Um, the frog is-- is good. It's good. It has nice color, it's cooked through, it's still moist on the inside, which is really very easy to overcook these. The shallots are caramelized perfectly, the mushrooms are crunchy and good. Your salad is interesting. But these potatoes look pretty soggy and greasy. I deglazed them and let them cook in the oven with wine. Wine with potatoes? Well, I thought that it would, like, kind of add a richness to them. Something you invented? Um-- because they're definitely soggy. It's a tough call to present a dish worthy of a place in the final having never cooked it before. No one can underestimate the pressure involved there, and you-- yeah, you nailed it. Visually, it's got that impact. Love the seasoning. It's got the perfect amount of acidity. Yeah, I mean, I love it. Tasty. But the potatoes, slightly too soggy. When I taste your frog legs, it doesn't strike me that you've never cooked them before. And more importantly, you didn't let these legs get the better of you, let me tell you. Good job. Really good job. Thank you. [cheers and applause] The frog legs are good. I like the texture. You didn't overcook it. The potato-- doing them too early and leaving them in that pan, I mean, literally, if you squeeze and just see... It's like a sponge. It's, like, really just kinda greasy and buttery. With what you were given, you made something that was rustic and homey. Good job. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. All right, becky! 

[00:19:33]


(Gordon) It's a tough call. Those frog legs were good. They really were. I mean, the sear-- (j) she should have more. We needed more from that dish. I mean, if you dissect it, it's like potatoes with a little bit of salad. /C(Joe) The big surprise for me was josh's dish. The sauces were delicious. It was really good. The only thing I didn't like was the lamb-- could have been a touch more. It should have been shredded. (Graham) The fried chicken was great. (Gordon) Do you think that christine should have played to her strengths-- vietnamese, or-- (Graham) I like that she went wn south. (Joe) Very simple dish at I surprisingly liked more than I thought I would have. Mm-hmm. The chicken-- the breading was exquisite. It was spiced and it was crunchy. It was really, really good. (Graham) The kale was too creamy. Too creamy. It didn't work for me, that last--that didn't work. We have to judge this challenge on those dishes alone. (Graham) Yeah. (Gordon) Christine, josh, and becky, three incredible dishes that have just made for some very heated discussion. Well done. all: THANK YOU. The first person through to the mastercheffinal... Is... Josh. [cheers and applause] Good job, josh. Me going to the final validates everything that I came to this competition to do. I put my whole life on hold to be here, and I've gotta win. There's nothing and nobody that can stop me. Vibrant, delicious, authentic. You left this competition on a frikkin' boiled egg, but you won your apron back. And look at you! Wow. Wow. Wow. How do you feel? It's like a dream come true. You deserve your place in the final. Well done. (Joe) Good job. Good job. Thank you, chef. It's me and christine standing here, and I'm just scared-- I'm really, really scared. Two gifted individuals. (Christine) Definitely a nervous feeling. 

[00:21:34]


I can hear becky next to me breathing and sighing. And I'm sort of the same way. My heart's racing. Whatever happens from now on in, you both should feel incredibly proud. But only one can join josh in the grand finale. The person joining josh... In the mastercheffinale... With the potential to publish your very own cookbook-- the $1/4 million and the right to call yourself masterchef... That person is... Congratulations, christine! SHUT THE [bleep] UP. [cheers and applause] Oh, becky. (Christine) It's really surreal. I just can't believe I've made it this far. I've definitely surprised myself just coming here and beinable to kick butt. Good job, christine! Good job, girl. I'm just completely, completely floored and, uh, devastated. Becky, honestly, your frog legs were delicious. But the plate was somewhat lacking. Unfortunately, the potatoes got the better of you. Too soggy and greasy. What happens next, becky? Go home and try to find a restaurant that I can kind of go sneak in and hopefully work at for a little while. I've got a few restaurants. Trust me, each and every one of those doors are open, whether it's the cen]er of europe, paris, new york, I don't care. The door is open. Anytime you wish. You have a gift, and you should be in the food industry. 

[00:23:35]


Thank you so much. Come here, you. Well done. Thank you. Come on. I truly felt like this was my path, but top three is pretty good. [cheers and applause] All right. Okay. (Becky) This has definitely been a life-changing experience. I could serve this as an appetizer in a restaurant. Thank you, chef. (Becky) The confidence that was instilled in me... Oh, my god! Is priceless. Congratulations, becky! This is a confirmation that even though I am a home cook... It's restaurant quality. Thank you. I have what it takes to be a chef. See you, guys. (Becky) I will get back up and I will always keep going because that's all I know how to do. (Gordon) Christine and josh, our mastercheffinalists-- well done! [cheers and applause] It's an amazing feeling. I have a lot of strength in me. No matter what knocks me down in life, I've overcome it, and josh is just another hurdle that's in my way, so I'm gonna go all the way and win that thing. Now, you've got one hand on that amazing trophy. Christine has a hard freakin' battle in front of her. I feel like I'm a better cook than I ever even thought I could be. The mastercheffinale is gonna be the biggest day in your entire lives. Good luck and good night. Thank you. Yeah! [cheers and applause] Go, christine! (announcer) Next week on masterchef... You'll face your toughest challenge (Gordon) The winner of masterchefis... (announcer) It's the explosive finale. [cheers and applause] Josh and christine face off in the biggest culinary showdown of the year. Good luck... I got it, though. (announcer) Only one will walk away with $1/4 million... (Christine) I want this more than anything I've ever wanted in my life. (announcer) A book deal... Tonight's the night I make it happen. (announcer) And the title of masterchef.

>> Vamos Al Punto. En este momento. ??Qui??n es el presidente leg??timo de Venezuela? El tribunal supremo de justicia dijo que Hugo Ch??vez, enfermo en Cuba, puede tomar posesi??n otro d??a, y no el diez de enero, como dice la constituci??n. Pero seg??n la oposici??n, esto viola las leyes. Tenemos ambos punto de vista, lo discutimos con la asamble??sta de la oposici??n, Mar??a Corina Machado, y tambi??n se encuentra con nosotros, para escuchar el punto de vista chavista, Ricardo Moreno, partidario del presidente Hugo Ch??vez. Adem??s se llevar?? a cabo este a??o la tan esperada reforma migratoria, o el cono se concentrar?? para pasar una ley que restrinja la compruso de armas. Para discutirlo, est?? con nosotros una de las nuevas caras en el congreso, representante de California, Juan Vargas. El ex presidente de M??xico Felipe Calder??n fue contratado como profesor de la Universidad de Harvard, pero hay estudiantes que no lo quieren ah??, por los m??s de sesenta y cinco mil muertos durante su gobierno. Marie Lloyd, una egresada de Harvard e investigadora de la UNAM en M??xico, nos explica por qu?? ella cree que Calder??n no debe estar en Harvard. Nos acompa??a la colombiana que destap?? el esc??ndalo de agentes secretos en los Estados Unidos involucrados con prostitutas, durante la cumbre de las Am??ricas en Cartagena. Dania Londo??o trae Al Punto su nuevo libro, la chica de Cartagena. Comenzamos. ?????????. 
>> Vamos Al Punto, con Jorge Ramos. 
>> Vamos Al Punto. Lo ??nico cierto en Venezuela es que Hugo Ch??vez no lleg?? el pasado jueves 10 de enero a su toma de posesi??n. Ch??vez est?? enfermo en Cuba, tras una cuarta operaci??n en contra del c??ncer. La constituci??n bolivariana en su art??culo 231, claramente dice que Ch??vez ten??a que tomar posesi??n, pero no lo hizo. La pregunta es entonces... ??Qui??n gobierna Venezuela? El tribunal supremo de justicia dijo en una controversial decisi??n que Ch??vez podr??a tomar posesi??n despu??s. Pero vamos por partes, veamos primero qu?? dice exactamente la constituci??n. 

[00:02:17]


>> Juro por todas las esperanzas. 
>> Esta imagen no se dio. El jueves 10 de enero, Hugo Ch??vez no estuvo aqu??. No jurament?? en la asamblea nacional para un nuevo periodo presidencial, como exige la constituci??n. No estuvo, ni todav??a est?? en Venezuela, porque contin??a en Cuba recuper??ndose de la ??ltima intervenci??n Quir??rgica a la que se someti?? el pasado once de diciembre por un c??ncer del que todav??a no se sabe ni d??nde est?? localizado, ni qu?? tan grave es. La constituci??n venezolana claramente establece en el art??culo 231, que debe haber juramento en la asamblea nacional el diez de enero. El problema es que el art??culo cambia de interpretaci??n si eres opositor o chavista. 
>> Aqu?? no estamos en Cuba, ni aqu?? es que el hermano le cede al otro hermano. Aqu?? no, aqu?? hay elecciones. 
>> Ya el presidente est?? en el ejercicio del cargo de presidente de la rep??blica. 
>> El hecho es que como controlan todos los poderes, tambi??n controlan la interpretaci??n constitucional. 
>> Otra pregunta clave es. ??Qui??n gobierna hoy a Venezuela? La constituci??n dice que si hay una falta absoluta del presidente, deben llamarse a elecciones y debe asumir la presidencia de forma temporal el presidente de la asamblea. 
>> Ni hay falta temporal, ni hay falta absoluta, ni hay toma de posesi??n del presidente de la asamblea, ni hay nada de lo que ellos han propuesto. 
>> Se refiere a lo que ha propuesto la oposici??n, grupo que le mand?? una carta a la Organizaci??n de Estados Americanos, denunciando un golpe constitucional en Venezuela. 
>> Incumplir la constituci??n es lo que es absolutamente ilegal, y nosotros no tenemos la culpa de que una parte del oficialismo no quiera poner a Diosdado Cabello como presidente encargado. 
>> El profesor Gamarra anticipa el riesgo del permiso indefinido que la asamblea nacional y el tribunal supremo le otorgaron al presidente para juramentar cuando pueda. 
>> Con las circunstancias que tenemos ahora, el vice-presidente maduro, cuyo t??rmino tambi??n feneci?? el diez, puede ser presidente indefinidamente. 

[00:04:27]


>> Ante tanta confusi??n e incertidumbre, lo que muchos se preguntan es si vamos a ver un chavismo sin Ch??vez. El profesor anticipa m??s pugnas por el poder dentro del Chavismo, que fuera. 
>> Nunca se preocup?? de mecanismos de sucesi??n, y al no preocuparse de mecanismos de sucesi??n, el chavismo como tal, es mucho menos fuerte que ??vez. 
>> Los chavistas dicen que la toma de posesi??n es s??lo un formulismo, pero es la primera vez, desde 1831, que este formulismo no se cumple en Venezuela. Para hablarnos de todo esto, para hablarnos del punto de vista de la oposici??n, habl?? a finales de esta semana, desde Caracas, Venezuela, con la asamble??sta y ex candidata presidencial, Mar??a Corina Machado. Gracias por estar con nosotros. ??Se viol?? la constituci??n cuando Ch??vez no toma posesi??n, y no se declara al presidente como ausente? 
>> Absolutamente s??, y hoy, 11 de enero, Venezuela amanece... Cabello de asumir de manera interina la presidencia de la rep??blica. Es lo que establece la constituci??n, es lo que todas las fuerzas democr??ticas hemos exigido, y la negaci??n de este mecanismo, hace que hoy exista en Venezuela, unos funcionarios que lo fueron hasta ayer, ministro y vicepresie, intentando seguir, o pretendiendo seguir ejerciendo estas funciones. Esta usurpaci??n de la autoridad, establece en el art??culo 138... 
>> Es un gobierno... ??Qui??n es hoy el presidente de Venezuela, entonces, leg??timamente? 

[00:06:28]


>> Esa es la gran pregunta. No hay... 
>> No hay presidente leg??timo en Venezuela ??Por qu?? el tribunal supremo de justicia no ha designado una junta m??dica que vaya a Cuba a determinar si Hugo Ch??vez puede gobernar o no? 
>> Precisamente porque sabemos que los poderes p??blicos son parte de... 
>> ??Cuba est?? en estos momentos dirigiendo los destinos de Venezuela? ??Son los hermanos Castro quienes est??n en este momento controlando Venezuela, decidiendo qu?? va a pasar y qu?? no va a pasar? 
>> Es que los propios jefes de los poderes p??blicos en Venezuela as?? lo han... El presidente de la asamblea nacional, Bracero, tiene nueve hermanos, . 
>> Dijo varias veces haber viajado a Cuba como tambi??n diosdado a recibir instrucciones el comandante. 
>> Nos preguntamos cual . 
>> Si ??l dijo que no se hab??a reunido con Ch??vez. de los poderes p??blicos en Venezuela? Hasta ayer, del ejecutivo Nicol??s Maduro. 

[00:08:41]


>> ??Hay una lucha de poder en estos momentos dentro del chavismo, es decir, hay una pelea abierta entre Nicol??s Maduro y el presidente de la asamblea nacional, Diosdado Cabello? 
>> Bueno, si la salida constitucional que establece... en su art??culo la constitucion que ante el escenario sea el presidente el que asuma el poder y si ??sta persona es parte del chavismo existe peligro de alg??n levantamiento militar. ??C??mo est??n reaccionando los militares? 
>> Bueno, . 
>> La tensi??n la desconfianza, la lucha de poder es tal que prefieren violar la constituci??n, ante de permitir que una de las dos partes asuma la presidencia de ven e. 
>> ??C??mo est??n reaccionando los miliatares?. . 
>> Nuestra soberan??a ha sido pisoteada, yo confio en nuestros oficiales y soldados. 
>> Como confio enero ??l pueblo de Venezuela, estamos viendo una situaci??n sin precedentes, d??nde se intenta dar legitimidad para dar un barniz de legitimidad a lo ilegitimable, porque hay hoy un gobierno as?? en ven e. . 

[00:10:49]


>> Esto no indica ni cuando ni d??nde. 
>> Indica que no est?? especificado en la constituci??n. 
>> Esto es claro . >E>EL art??culo establece que si el presidente no puede, lo haga en el tsj es para evitar que la asamblea nacional no se constituya, y en segundo lugar es taxativo que el periodo constitucional comienza el 10 de enero. . 
>> Hay una alteracion grave, al ordanamiento constitucional, esto no cierra, pero Venezuela ha cerrado acuerdos y por eso hemos dirigido cartas al secretaria nacional de la oea porque as?? como actuaron r??pido en el caso de Ecuador, Honduras y Paraguay ahora nos dan la espalda a los venezolanos, van a desconocer ??sta violaci??n. 
>> De acuerdo al estdo de derecho. 
>> No hay presidente en Venezuela . 
>> Correcto?. no hay presidente leg??timo, nohay presidente en este momento. 

[00:12:52]


>> Hay un presidente electo. 
>> No hay comandante en jefe de la fuerzas armadas y hay algunos que pretenden usurpar la autoridad, todos sus actos son nulso desdes ese momento . Ricardo Moreno, presidente de la asociaci??n Sim??n Bolivar. Se??or Moreno, gracias por estar con nosotros. 
>> Buenos d??as Jorge, gracias por la invitaci??n. 
>> Acabamos de entrevistar a la asamble??sta Mar??a Corina Machado, y ella nos dijo que el actual gobierno en Venezuela, seg??n sus palabras, es un gobierno usurpador, y que en estos momentos no hay presidente leg??timo en Venezuela. Ese nto de vista de ella. ??Cu??l es su punto de vista? 
>> Es interesante que... ahora los diputados que defienden la constiucion no lo hicieran antes cuando muchos de ellos firmaron un madanto de facto en Venezuela la constituci??n est?? funcionando el art??culo 231 dice que ??l puede juramentarse ante el tribunal supremo de justicia la constituci??n no espec??fica d??a u hora y si hay un imprevisto el tribunal supremo de justicia dictamin?? diciendo que el presidente ocntinua en ejercicio de sus funciones maduro y los ??rganos tambi??n El art??culo 231, perdone que lo interrumpa, claramente dice que el presidente tiene que tomar posesi??n el diez de enero, eso es lo que dice la constituci??n. 

[00:15:15]


>> S??, correcto, pero se lee la primera parte del art??culo. Dice, tiene que tomar el diez de enero... del primero a??o de su periodo constitucional . 
>> Si por cualquer motivo n pudiese tomarlo lo har?? ante el tribunal supremo de justicia . 
>> Pero la fecha no cambia. 
>> Sigue siendo el 10 de enero y Hugo Ch??vez no estuvo en Venezuela el 10 de enero . 
>> Es lo que reclama la oposici??n de una falta temporal. rep??blica no pudiese tomar posesi??n ante la asamblea nacional, lo har?? ante el tribunal supremo ??Pero no es obvio que Hugo Ch??vez no est?? ah??? O sea, Hugo Ch??vez est?? operado en Cuba, est?? recuper??ndose de un c??ncer, Hugo Ch??vez no est?? en Venezuela. ??No es esuna ausencia? Temporal o absoluta, como usted quisiera definirla. ??Pero no una ausencia? Y si es una ausencia. ??No le corresponde entonces al presidente de la asamblea tomar el lugar y no a Nicol??s Maduro, que no fue elegido popularmente? 
>> No, a??n no, porque lo que ocurre es que la . 
>> Le cncedio un permiso. Permiso, tambi??n hay que tener en cuenta que el presidente Ch??vez es un presidente reelecto, es como decir el presidente Obama aqu?? en los Estados Unidos, el 21 de enero va a asumir, es un presidente reelecto, va hacia una extensi??n del segundo mandato. 
>> En eso estamos de acuerdo, pero... 
>> Lo mismo est?? ocurriendo con ??Qui??n gobierna ahora? eso no es un gobierno que usurpa el poder de otro no porque el tribunal de justicia es el final y dictamin?? que el gobierno de Ch??vez contin??a en ejercicio . 

[00:18:00]


>> SI fuera costa rica u otro no habr??a este esc??ndalo . 
>> eN Estados Unidos en el a??o 2000 cuando la reelecci??n del presidente George Bush mando a parar en Miami y Florida por un voto de diferente 5 a 4 que George Bush era el presidente constitucional electo. 
>> Entonces, si la Corte Suprema de justicia . >>EEnero ??l caso de Venezuela, porque no enviar a una junta m??dica. 
>> El tribunal supremo de justicia no ha querido enviar una junta para ver si Ch??vez est?? bien . 
>> Los acontecimientos en Venezuela se est??n desarrollando, no quiero abrir pas?? a especulaciones, a Ch??vez, lo han matado, lo han resucitado, ahora clama porque sae que no le han podido ganar a Ch??vez en ninguna elecci??n. 
>> SIn estar presente en las campa??as se ganaron 20 gobernaciones, si ??l hubiera participado, capriles no ser??a el ganador . 
>> Los ??nico En cualquier. 
>> es un esc??ndalo interncional y en Venezuela dem??cracompa????a ha funcionado. 
>> La asamblea lo considera y ahora el tribunal supremo de justicia lo dictamina . leg??timo de Venezuela en estos momentos sigue siendo Hugo Ch??vez. 

[00:20:14]


>> Sigue siendo Hugo Ch??vez, hasta que no se activen los mecanismos constitucionales de una falta temporal, y luego... una falta absoluta y eso solo puede hacerlo la asamblea constitucional gracias por hablar con nosotros regresamos con una de las nuevas caras hispanas, en M??xico Juan Vargas, sus padres fueronn siinmigrantes . 

[00:24:04]


>> y ahora seguimos con las nuevas caras hispanas en Washington . 
>> Para que se dencuenta de lo que ha logrado sus padres fueron inmigrantes tiene 9 hermanos y. 
>> Gracias por estar con nosotros . 
>> Un placer estar con nosotros . Para que lo eligieron?. 
>> En mi ??rea lo m??s importante es decir, mucha gente que viene de M??xico y Sud Am??rica . 
>> Tenemos que tener una reforma migratoria para que ??sta gentes se pueda quedar y ??sta gente es trabajadores, lo m??s importante en el ??rea, usted es el primer congresista latino que representa a California en M??xico. 
>> Solo nos creemos el cuento o igual no pasar?? nada como hace 4 a??os . 
>> Es triste lo que pas?? hace 4 a??os. 
>> EL presidente prometi?? . 
>> Republicanos dijieron hay que trabajar juntos, pero ahora si nos levantamos como pueblo y nosotros decidimos la presidencia. 
>> M??s le vale que haga algo porque somos muchos, nosotros que estamos en el congreso, vamos a hacer algo, tanta gente trabajadores tiene que hacerse algo . 
>> M??s la vela. 

[00:26:06]


>> ??C??mo mantivueron el espa??ol en casa?. 
>> Su padre, que hablban en casa?. 
>> Solo en espa??ol, cuando fuimos a la escuela en ingl??s, mi mam?? era braba, dijo aqu?? se hablka espa??o. 
>> Lo hablamos muchito, pero lo entendemos bien. 
>> En la escuela y otros lugares el ingl??s. 
>> Lo que usted relata. 
>> Es que eran tan pobres que no pod??an tener ni mascotas. 
>> y usted se hizo famoso tirandolso al aire y luego casandolo . 
>> ??QUIEN le dijo que pod??a llegar a harvard y Obama . 
>> Mi padre y mi mam??. 
>> dijo que aqu?? se puede lograr todo y yo siempre lo cre??, a??n pienso que la gente tiene una oportunidad en este pa??s, y viene mucha gente para hacer algo nuevo y entonces, nosotros tenemos esa responsabilidad de hacer algo grande, muchos por pobreza no pueden, yo por lo menos pens?? que era cierto, mis hermanos y hermanas, ten??amos la esperanza, cual es susue??o. 
>> Si usted fue a pesar de ser hijo de un inmigrante. 
>> Quiz??s la pregunta es si el sue??o americano a??n es importante para ustedes. 

[00:28:11]


>> Tiene que estar presente porque mucha pobre gente trabaja duro . Porque no tienen dinero, y no son ciudadanos. Es decir, porque no tienen papeles, entonces tenemos que cambiar las leyes para que esos sue??os puedan ser reales para todos, porque hay mucha gente ahorita, verdad, especialmente esos muchachos que nacieron en M??xico u otros lugares, y no saben ellos que no son ciudadanos. Entonces yo conozco aqu?? muchos que trabajan mucho en las escuelas, llegan entonces a la universidad y no pueden entrar o no pueden pagarlas, porque no son ciudadanos. Por eso necesitamos este cambio en la migraci??n, para que esta gente puedan ser ciudadanos y puedan lograr este sue??o que es importante para todos. 
>> Congresista, otro de los temas que quer??a hablar con usted es sobre el control de armas. El pr??ximo lunes el vicepresidente Joe Biden, va a dar sus recomendaciones sobre c??mo evitar otra masacre como la de Newtown, en donde murieron veinte ni??os. ??Usted cree que hay que poner guardias armados en todos los lugares p??blicos? ??En cines, en escuelas, en centros de gobierno, en centros comerciales, para evitar este tipo de masacres? ??O por el contrario hay que limitar las armas y que casi nadie en este pa??s tenga acceso a ellas? ??Cu??l es la soluci??n? 
>> Yo creo que la soluci??n es limitar las armas. Es decir, en este pa??s el a??o pasado, mataron m??s o menos como once mil personas con estas armas, es decir, las balas aqu?? mataron a once mil. En Inglaterra, solamente a treinta y cinco. ??Qu?? es la diferencia? La diferencia creo yo, es que all?? se limita qui??n puede tener un arma. Y , en los Estados Unidos, cualquiera puede tener un arma. Si yo quiero ir a comprar diez, veinte armas, yo voy y las compro. ??Verdad? A la tienda, y eso no est?? bien. Tenemos que tener un control aqu?? que no tenemos, es decir, tenemos que cambiar las leyes, porque la ley dice que la constituci??n permite que cualquiera tenga armas. No es cierto, es muy limitado realmente por qu?? uno puede tener un arma, entonces nosotros deber??amos de cambiar la ley, a limitarlo lo m??s posible, porque ahorita hay masacres por todas partes, y esto no debe de ser. En un pa??s como nosotros, desarrollado, no debemos tener este tipo de violencia, como en Inglaterra no hay, en otros lugares no hay. 

[00:30:23]


>> ??Usted tiene armas en su casa? ??Y con su padre, el ten??a arma en la casa? 
>> Bueno no, yo no tengo armas en la casa, menos que estas dos. Pero ah?? en la casa no tenemos armas, mi padre tambi??n... Bueno, mi padre s?? ten??a un arma cuando estaba ah?? en el rancho, y solamente era para los coyotes. Y no m??s tiraba una bala, no m??s era de ese tipo de rifle e uno echaba una bala, entonces la quebraba y le pon??a una de nuevo. Ese tipo de arma es muy dif??cil har masacre, porque las masacres realmente se hacen con las armas que tienen muchas balas, cuando pueden repetir una tras otra, y matan tantos ni??os. Entonces creo que si se limitan estas armas, las armas que solamente pueden tirar un balazo por tiempo, creo que eso ser??a un logro grande. 
>> Congresista Vargas, gracias por estar con nosotros, y ojal?? se d?? cuenta que su ejemplo es maravilloso para muchos hijos de inmigrantes que como usted, llegaron a Harvard y luego al congreso de los Estados Unidos. Gracias por estar con nosotros. 
>> Es un honor estar con ustedes, y especialmente mi pap?? siempre lo miraba, desgraciadamente muri?? como hace un mes, pero siempre lo miraba. Aqu?? viene Jorge Ramos, c??llense. 
>> Congresista Vargas, gracias por estar con nosotros. Hasta la pr??xima. Vamos a hacer una pausa, cuando regresemos, las protestas en contra del ex presidente de M??xico, Felipe Calder??n en Harvard. Miles creen que no debe estar ah?? el responsable de una pol??tica que dej?? sesenta y cinco mil muertos. El brote de gripe ya afecta a los 50 estados del pais.En algunas zonas, se manifiesta como una temporada normal de influenza.Pero en otros, se han agotado las vacunas y la enfermedad ha provocado muertes, mayormente de niqos y ancianos.?Que tal?, Les habla natalia cruz... Vamos al punto de las noas.Las autoridades dijeron que tres hombres de utah, ejecutivos de un banco, murieron al estrellarse la avioneta en la que viajaban.El accidente ocurrio poco despues que la aeronave despego de un aeropuerto en texas.El senador marco rubio revelo partes de su propuesta para reformar el sistema de inmigracion, que incluye un camino hacia la ciudadania para los indocumentados que ya estan en estados unidos.Rubio dijo que el centro de la idea es economico.Y las tasas de nacimientos han descendido a una cifra record en estados unidos.Y la reduccion es mas pronunciada entre los inmigrantes.La causa principal parece ser la crisis economica. Ahora regresamos a la discusion y el debate con jorge ramos. A los pocos d??as de haber terminado su mandato como presidente de M??xico, Felipe Calder??n se fue del pa??s con su familia y vol?? a Boston, donde fue contratado como profesor por la Universidad de Harvard. Es un programa especial, destinado a jefes de estado y pol??ticos prominentes, en ingles le llaman fellowship, es un programa, es s??lo un a??o. Esto no significa una contrataci??n de muchos a??os, ni de por vida. Pero ya se han reunido m??s de trece mil firmas exigiendo que la Universidad de Harvard retire su invitaci??n a Calder??n, argumentando que su pol??tica en contra del narcotr??fico ocasion?? m??s de sesenta y cinco mil muertos en M??xico. Marion Lloyd es una egresada de Harvard, es investigadora de la Universidad Nacional Aut??noma de M??xico, ha sido corresponsal para varios medios en la rep??blica mexicana, incluyendo el Boston Globe, y ella se opone a la presencia del ex presidente Calder??n en Harvard. Nos acompa??a v??a sat??lite, desde el Distrito Federal. Marion, gracias por hablar con nosotros. 

[00:36:55]


>> Muchas gracias a ustedes. 
>> Marion. ??Por qu?? no debe estar Felipe Calder??n en Harvard? 
>> Bueno, yo creo que para empezar, pues quisiera aclarar que no me opongo necesariamente, seguramente al derecho de libre expresi??n del ex presidente, muchos que defienden su estancia en Harvard dicen que pues puede hablar, puede ser libre de hablar de lo que quiere, lo que me opongo es la presencia totalmente a critica, cuando Harvard presenta que va a ser un fellow, dicen que fue un l??der dem??crata ejemplar, que va a iluminar a los estudiantes de Harvard, que fue un l??der pro mercado, que hizo mucho por el medio ambiente, y en ning??n momento mencionan que fue un presidente sumamente controvertido, y ni siquiera tocan el tema de su guerra contra el narcotr??fico, y finalmente yo creo que ahorita van casi cuarenta mil o m??s de cuarenta mil firmas en contra, en dos peticiones distintas, una en espa??ol y una en ingles, por la gente que est?? ofendida, que hay much??simas demandas, cuestiones de acusaciones, de violaciones de derechos humanos muy serios, el propio gobierno mexicano, bueno, sali?? en un reportaje en el Washington Post, con un documento supuestamente interno, que hay veinticinco mil desaparecidos, en reportes extra oficiales hasta cien mil muertos, es una pol??tica que, mientras no me opongo a la pol??tica como tal de enfrentar al narcotr??fico, s?? me opongo al absoluto irrespeto por los derechos humanos. 
>> ??Se puede culpar entonces a Felipe Calder??n desde este punto de vista? 
>> Y creo que al darle esta plaza... ??S??? 
>> Perd??n, Marion. ??Se puede culpar al ex presidente Felipe Calder??n de estos sesenta y cinco mil muertos por su pol??tica anti narcos? Es decir. ??T?? crees que ??l es el responsable personal de estas muertes? 
>> No, no lo creo. Creo que s?? es el responsable por much??simos de los casos de tortura. Una cosa es enfrentar a los narcotraficantes, otra cosa es detener a una persona en su casa, torturarlo, matarlo, desaparecerlo, y de esos casos hay miles. Tambi??n creo que es culpable de no haber aceptado las recomendaciones de su propia suprema corte, de que estos casos sean enjuiciados en cortes, en tribunales civiles. Se hablan de m??s de tres mil casos que han llegado a los tribunales, de los cuales militares, de los cuales se han resuelto como treinta casos. Es risible, es ignorar el dolor y pues... Una total falta de respeto por los derechos humanos. 

[00:39:27]


>> Queda clar??simo que no est??s de acuerdo con la pol??tica del presidente Felipe Calder??n, pero el dean de la escuela de gobierna, John F. Kennedy en Harvard, dio a conocer a los medios de comunicaci??n una carta en la que ??l dice que reconoce que mucha gente como t?? no est??n de acuerdo con Felipe Calder??n, pero que llevarlo a ??l a Harvard, va a permitir que los estudiantes tengan contacto con un ex presidente, y al mismo tiempo que discutan con ??l esto mismo que t?? y yo estamos discutiendo por televisi??n. ??Por qu?? no permitirlo? 
>> No es una cuesti??n de permitirlo. Yo creo que lo que me ofendi?? mucho, por parte de mi alma m??ter, fue la forma en la cual anunciaron este puesto. Si hubieran dicho de un inicio, sabemos que es una figura muy controvertida, que queremos fomentar una discusi??n en torno a temas muy delicados, igual no me hubiera opuesto. Lo que me ofendi?? fue esta presentaci??n, alabarlo de esa forma, como si fuera no s??, el Gorbachov en su momento de M??xico, y finalmente pues es una figura no solamente por la guerra del narco, por la forma en que lleg?? al poder, con la cuesti??n de las elecciones, altamente cuestionados si realmente fue electo o no. Yo creo que es dar un mensaje de que pues es un ex presidente de un pa??s poderoso, es un egresado de Kennedy School, entonces por lo tanto le vamos a alabar. Yo creo que ahorita est??n haciendo control de da??os. Ahorita est??n diciendo, reconocemos que hay muchos que no est??n de acuerdo, pues porque no lo hicieron en su momento. Y segundo, s?? creo que hay un tema muy delicado de la cuesti??n de la inmunidad pol??tica, el estar en Estados Unidos, como hemos visto en el caso de Ernesto Zedillo, le da un fuero a Felipe Calder??n. ??Realmente Estados Unidos quiere dar ese fuero? ??Quiere cerrar las puertas a estas demandas ante la corte criminal internacional, o futuros casos que pueden salir, ya que no es presidente? Yo creo que es un mensaje delicado, y adem??s, despu??s de que la Universidad de Texas decidi?? que no quisieron contratarlo. Oficialmente nunca anunciaron cu??les fueron los criterios, pero ah?? hubo muchas manifestaciones y creo que hay s??lidas razones. Y tercero, no estoy convencida de que tenga el perfil acad??mico, realmente, para aportar much??simo a la Escuela Kennedy, pero eso yo creo que es finalmente secundario. 

[00:41:57]


>> Como t?? mencionaste, el ex presidente Ernesto Zedillo, a quien muchos culparon por la masacre de Acteal en Chiapas, M??xico, est?? quedando demostrado que muchos presidentes tienen fuero precisamente por haber sido presidente, y est??n protegidos por las leyes norteamericanas. En el caso de Felipe Calder??n. ??Fue Felipe Calder??n, es responsable Felipe Calder??n de violaciones a los derechos humanos, y crees t?? que debe ser enjuiciado en una corte internacional? 
>> Yo s?? creo que deber??a responder. Yo no s?? si deber??a estar enjuiciado, yo creo que deber??a dar explicaciones, deber??a por lo menos reconocer, como b??sicamente pasa con... Yo creo que los que presentaron la demanda, creo que en octubre del a??o pasado, en el tribunal internacional, quisieron una explicaci??n. Los mismos reconocieron que era muy dif??cil que fuera enjuiciado en la forma en que fue enjuiciado Pinochet, por ejemplo. Pero s?? creo que merece, que es su obligaci??n dar una explicaci??n, y pues probablemente recibir las cr??ticas y enfrentarlas. No me molestar??a que fuera demandado de una forma civil, yo creo que s?? hay, tiene una responsabilidad y no la ha enfrentado. 
>> Marion Lloyd, gracias por hablar con nosotros. Marion Lloyd, es egresada de Harvard, investigadora de la UNAM, y ex corresponsal en la Ciudad de M??xico. Muchas gracias. 
>> Muchas gracias. 
>> Vamos a hacer una pausa. Cuando regresemos, tenemos una c??ndida conversaci??n con la colombiana, que desat?? el esc??ndalo de prostituci??n de los agentes del servicio secreto de Estados Unidos. Dania Londo??o publica un libro llamado La Chica de Cartagena, hablamos con ella de lo p??blico y lo privado al volver. La presidenta de argentina, dijo en la capital de cuba que se reunio con la familia de hugo chavez y que no le corresponde a ella hablar de la salud del gobernante de veela.?Que tal?, Les habla natalia cruz... Defensores de los animales protestaron en mexico por la captura de 57 perros a los que las autoridades culpan de las muertes de cinco personas. Decenas de miles de personas protestaron en la capital rusa contra una prohibicion de que los estadounidenses adopten ninos rusos.Y la policia dijo que arresto a seis hombres por otra violacion en pandilla de una pasajera de autobus en india, cuatro semanas despues de un mortal ataque similar que provprotestas masivas. Mas esta tarde en noticiero univision 

[00:47:06]


>> Casi nadie se acuerda de lo que acordaron y lo que dijeron los presidentes en la pasada Cumbre de las Am??ricas en Cartagena, Colombia. Pero de lo que muchos s?? se acuerdas, es del esc??ndalo que surgi?? cuando se descubri?? que agentes del servicio secreto de los Estados Unidos hab??an contratado prostitutas, y pusieron en peligro la seguridad nacional del pa??s. Esta semana, por cierto, salieron a la luz m??s detalles de la investigaci??n, y se dio a conocer que un agente de la DEA, fue quien hizo el trato para contratar los servicios de una prostituta para un agente del servicio secreto. La colombiana que desat?? este esc??ndalo es Dania Londo??o, quien public?? el libro La Chica de Cartagena, y esta, fue parte de nuestra conversaci??n. Dania, gracias por estar con nosotros y contarnos tu historia. 
>> Hola, Jorge. ??Qu?? te gustar??a que te contara espec??ficamente? 
>> Quisiera comenzar con el primera cap??tulo. El primer cap??tulo comienza de esta forma, 
dice: Yo no sospech?? que aquel hombre fuera un agente de seguridad, ni que sus amigos lo fueran, dices en el libro. Y el comportamiento de ??l tampoco daba para pensar nada especial, era como cualquier otro hombre. A la larga, lo ??nico diferente es que era m??s bruto, porque si fuera inteligente, no hubiera permitido que ocurriera lo que ocurri??, y dicen que trabajaba en inteligencia. ??Qu?? ocurri??, Dania? 
>> Pues esa noche yo sal?? con mis amigas a tomarme unas copas, a pasarla rico, a una discoteca normal en Cartagena que se llama Tu Candela. Cuando est??bamos ah??, pues se acercaron unos hombres, y ellos hablaban su ingl??s, y obvio. ??No? Y yo hablaba mi espa??ol, muy poco ingl??s, pero ten??a una amiga que me traduc??a un poco, y pues ellos se acercaron sin ninguna maldad, y nosotros hablamos, pues nos re??mos, bailamos, la pasamos s??per rico. A la hora de ellos decirme a m?? que si quer??an ir al hotel, pues yo le dije que si yo me iba con ellos, que me ten??an que dar un regalito, se lo dije en ingl??s. Y fue lo acordado, y pues cuando llegamos al hotel, pues no cumpli?? con el pacto que hab??amos tenido, y yo en s?? no form?? esc??ndalo. No s?? de d??nde sali?? ese esc??ndalo, pues yo solamente llam?? a la seguridad del hotel, y le dije que el hombre no me quer??a pagar mi dinero. 

[00:49:28]


>> En el libro dices lo siguiente, Dania. 
Dices: Estoy en la boca de Barack Obama. Mov??a al servicio secreto, puse a hablar de m?? al director de la CIA, al presidente de los Estados Unidos, y eso a m?? me satisfac??a, pero al principio me daba mucho miedo de que hubiera represalias. ??Qu?? tipo de represalias tem??as? 
>> Pues de lo que yo escuch?? un poco, era que los hombres eran francotiradores, o sea, a qu?? mujer no le va a dar miedo enfrentarse con el gobierno de Estados Unidos, m??s con esa gente, de su trabajo. O sea, me daba miedo, tem??a por m??, tem??a por mi hijo, tem??a por toda mi familia, y todav??a sigo temiendo por ellos. 
>> ??Qu?? temor existe? 
>> De que me hagan algo, de que me pase algo. No he recibido nada, Jorge, no ha pasado nada. Incluso estuve en la embajada de Estados Unidos en Espa??a, y me atendieron s??per bien y hablamos normal, junto con mi abogado y todo, pero o sea, a m?? me van a hacer algo y no me van a decir Dania te vamos a matar o Dania te vamos a secuestrar, o Dania te vamos a hacer algo. O sea, eso es algo obvio que no van a darme como una iniciativa, o me van a decir lo que me va a pasar, no. 
>> Quiz??s la principal preocupaci??n del gobierno norteamericano es que t?? al penetrar el servicio secreto de los Estados Unidos, podr??a haber sido utilizado por terroristas potencialmente. T?? escribes lo siguiente en la p??gina once. Dices, es que corr??a un rumor que yo era terrorista, y que hab??a armado un complot. De hecho, un abogado me demand??, y todav??a estoy demandada en la fiscal??a. Y luego cuentas claramente, en la p??gina sesenta y cinco, 
dices: Yo nunca le revis?? la maleta, te refieres al agente secreto, yo nunca le revis?? su maleta, ni mir?? adentro de los closets. En ning??n momento aprovech?? que ??l dorm??a. O sea, desde tu punto de vista, est?? claro que nunca sacaste informaci??n confidencial del gobierno Norteamericano. 
>> No he hecho nada, y no tienen por qu?? temer de m??, porque la verdad, despu??s que lo hubiese querido, pues lo hubiese hecho, eso lo afirmo. Pero no, no lo he hecho, no he revisado ni maleta, ni celulares ni nada. O sea, estuvo a mi alcance, porque s??, obvio, si estoy sola con un hombre en una habitaci??n y ??l est?? pasado de tragos, y siendo yo una mujer del bajo mundo, como la gente me especifica, y ese caso dado, sabiendo yo... En ese caso dado, si hubiese sabido yo que ellos eran eso, pues obvio que yo hubiese podido sacar informaci??n. 

[00:51:45]


>> Dania. ??Cu??l es la diferencia entre una prostituta y una prepago, como t?? dices en el libro? 
>> Bueno, qu?? te digo, Jorge. Suena muy feo lo que te voy a decir, ni me gusta discriminar a las personas ni nada as?? por el estilo, pero yo creo que las prostitutas son esas mujeres que est??n en los bares, que viven en los bares, que son los burdeles, que se paran en las esquinas de las calles, que est??n por ah?? y que van haciendo cosas por cualquier peso que le den. En cambio las prepagos no, las prepagos tienen su casa, tienen su vida normal, se relacionan con la sociedad, estudian, trabajan, tienen una vida com??n y corriente. ??S?? me entiendes? Simplemente que tienen una doble vida en la noche, y no todas las noches, sino que cuando ellas tienen un contacto, tienen una especie de manager, y cuando sale una situaci??n, que uno le llama tiqui tiqui, cuando sale el tiqui tiqui lo llaman, lo contactan a uno, y uno va. 
>> En la p??gina 237, hablas de tu hijo, tu hijo que tiene nueve a??os de edad, 
y duces lo siguiente: Con mi hijo yo tengo la confianza de amigos y hermanos, m??s que la de hijo a madre. El tiene nueve a??os, es muy inteligente, 
viene y me dice: ??Mami, t?? sabes que eres famosa? Y yo me quedo mir??ndola, 
y contin??as en el libro: Si t?? supieras que clase de fama tengo yo, entonces me da miedo, me dan ganas de llorar, porque siento que un d??a va a saberlo. ??Ese es tu principal temor? 
>> S??... Mi principal temor, ese es mi temor. Yo creo que es el temor m??s grande que tengo ahora mismo, es ese, enfrentarme a la realidad cuando mi hijo, yo c??mo le voy a decir a mi 
hijo: Hijo, sigue el ejemplo m??o. O sea, mira a tu madre como ha progresado. O soy esa mujer. Me da temor de que mi hijo m??s adelante, cuando tenga 18 a??os, 17 a??os, que est?? en una universidad y que sus amigou le digan. Imira, pero tu mam?? era la prostituta m??s famosa del mundo! O sea, no es f??cil. Y por m??s que yo quiera tapar el sol con un dedo, no puedo, esa es la realidad de la vida y ya. Pero s?? que mi hijo, yo s?? en el fondo de mi coraz??n que mi hijo no me va a juzgar y me va a aceptar tal cual como soy. O sea, como es el y como yo lo conozco, yo s?? que me va a apoyar a m??. 

[00:54:16]


>> Es Dania Londo??o, el libro es La Chica de Cartagena, la mujer que puso en jaque al servicio secreto de los Estados Unidos. Gracias. 
>> A ti, Jorge. 
>> Dania Londo??o, tambi??n nos habl?? como en una ocasi??n intent?? quitarse la vida, puede ver sus declaraciones en una entrevista mucho m??s extensa, en uvideos.com. Regresamos. ??? ??? ???. 

[00:58:30]


>> Las oportunidades que me ha brindado este pa??s, que hubiera sido mucho m??s dif??cil, es sobresalir profesionalmente como una mujer, y el nivel de participaci??n, otra cosa que quiz??s nunca hubiera podido hacer en mi pa??s, es el nivel de participaci??n pol??tica que he tenido en este pa??s. Votar, tener un voto libre en mi pa??s por much??simos a??os, el voto no era libre, por setenta a??os en mi pa??s tuvimos un solo partido, que por setenta a??os gan??, y venir aqu?? por primera vez, pensar que se pod??a votar, y que nadie te preguntaba o te dec??a, fue muy interesante. En mi , antes de venir aqu??, me parece que vot?? dos veces, porque no ten??a ning??n inter??s en participar en algo que no era democr??tico. 
>> Esto es parte, por supuesto, de generaci??n Am??rica, y usted puede ser parte. Los invitamos a que participen en este gran movimiento. Simplemente vayan a generacionamerica.com, y cu??ntenos su historia. Todos somos generaci??n Am??rica. Le recuerdo que la pr??xima semana tendremos un programa especial de Al Punto, con la toma de posesi??n del presidente Barack Obama desde Washington, as?? que hasta la pr??xima semana, cuando juntos vayamos Al Punto. Gracias. ?????????.

=======================================================

>>. 
>> Gregg: Hello, I'm gregg jarrett. Welcome to a brand-new hour. 
>> Arthel: I'm arthel nevil. Hospitals across the country struggle to care for thousands of americans coming down with the flu while running low on vaccine doses. 
>> Gregg: And france is now saying that the united states is aiding effort to fight islamic extremists, what it may mean for our military. 
>> Arthel: President obama chosen few, the cabinet nominees that will face congress. We have a fair and balanced debate. 
>> Gregg: We begin this hour with the future of america's gun laws, now the focus of a red hot debate. Joe biden is getting ready to make had his recommendations to president obama this tuesday on ways to curb gun violence. Coming up about monthfter the school shootings in connecticut, speculation is growing on what he will propose and also the arguments on sunday political talk shows. Peter doocy has more on the plan expected to be unveiled this week. Is the nra changing their tune on gun control? 
>> Reporter: No, they are n. David keen is still steamed that obama administration is putting emphasis on it. He doesn't think he is tag their concerns seriously. 
>> We wish instead of talking about guns specifically that they question that they would address what can we do to prevent these kinds of things in the future. The evidence shows that an assault weapons ban are not going to do that. What will do it is doing something about a broken mental health system that allows people that potentially violent to be the streets. 

[00:02:14]


>> Reporter: Furthermore, the nra is making it clear they don't think there are enough members of congress that favor an assault weapons ban to pass one. 
>> Gregg: It's quite the face-off. Is the nra's position cautioning the gun control advocates to back down at all? 
>> No, some are wondering out loud how much clout they have in 2013. 
>> The nra spent a lot of money on the elections last cycle. They didn't have a lot to show for it especially if you look at results. A lot of their candidates lost. We are looking at return on their investment they had a low return on investment. They are very strong lobby. Think the issue is who is going to remember the voices of the american people in this debate. 
>> Reporter: President obama has said he wants to lay it on some of the proposals his task force gives him in the state of the union address. That task force led by the vice president is going to give president obama their recommendations on tuesday in the state of the union is SCHEDULED FOR FEBRUARY 12th, ONE Month from yesterday. 
>> Gregg: Peter, thanks very much. 
>> Fox news is taking a closer look at the gun control debate with a special hannity airing tonight featuring a studio audience compromised some of the new yorkers who were outed by the journal news for having gun permits. That is at 9:00 p.M. Eastern time right here on fox news channel. 
>> Arthel: Growing concerns over the shortages of flu vaccines as sick americans are overcrowding emergency roommates and the cdc says the flu outbreak is reaching epidemic levels with new york state declaring a public health emergency. Anna has more. 
>> Reporter: This year's strain is nasty. It's particularly bad making people sicker for longer. Hospitals around the country have seen spikes in flu related admissions and deaths. Nationally public health officials say some places are experiencing shortages and patients are having to wait on shipments coming in.

>> Yesterday evening, 123 flu vaccines and now we have would than or two left. 
>> This shows how bad the flu is. It's an epidemic right now. 
>> Reporter: But physicians are urging americans to be persistent because vaccine is still available. Now is the time to get the shot. According to the cdc the vaccine is 62% effective in preventing the flu and it takes two weeks to work. Nearly 130 million doses of flu vaccine have been distributed and so far, at least 112 million have been used. Officials say the media has helped raise awareness, but the very young, vy old and those were underlying conditions are most at risk, they tend to visit the doctor on more and get their shots during other scheduled visits. 
>> So I think if you can see looking around, many of the patients are coming in today, not all of them, are younger who heard on the news that healthy people are getting the flu. 
>> Reporter: They caution everyone to wash their hands often. The virus is eald spreod planes and trains and common places like escalators and even the handle at gas pump. 
>> Arthel: I am all over that stuff. I sat down today, I took a alcohol wipe and wiped my computer key down. If I pump gas I use the sanitizer. My hands are like wrinkled. 
>> Gregg: Let me get this stimulated, you wipe down your computer but you didn't give me one. 
>> Arthel: You were on your own. 
[ Laughter ] wipe it down. 
>> Gregg: She just doesn't care.

Is providing communications and transportation help. U.S. Officials say they also offered to send drones to the african nation. Meanwhile, the french military is claiming new success after launching air strikes on at least four northern towns including major city where they targeted training camps used by the al-qaeda linked rebel group controlling the city. 
>> Gregg: A major development out of egypt as they order a retile of hosni mubarak he was convicted of killing hundreds of protestors that ended in regime. The ruling coming two years after his downfall with egypt still mired in political turmoil. Coner powell has more on the story. 
>> Reporter: There were loud cries of joy and celebration in the courtroom as the judge issued his acquittal notice. Members and supporters of the mubarak government were happy to see this outcome believing that this was the due justice that the former president deserves and they were heard scream, long live justice. Defense lawyers argued that mubarak didn't know about the killings and he didn't direct the killings on protestors two years ago. The judge agreed that mubarak and former chief of security will be re-tried along with several others who were part of the government that were acquitted during the first trial. As of now, there has not been a trial set but mubarak remains in jail temporarily and facing charges of corruption. It was reported that he was on deathbed and health dleipg. There were reports he had fallen and broken ribs but we don't know what health he is right now. It is apparently declining. Over the last two years we've seen a lot of turmoil and violence and a lot of chaos in egypt and across egypt. Whether or not this will trigger new rounds of protests isn't clear, but certainly illicit do little to help stabilize this country going forward.

>> Gregg: Thank you. 
>> Arthel: It's been three years since the devastating earthquake hit the island of haiti killing more than 300,000 people. Our own greta van susteren traveled to haiti shortly after the quake and tonight she is taking a look back at her time there and how the people are doing now.

>> Arthel: It is on the record special with greta van susteren, airing at 10:00 p.M. Eastern right here on the fox news channel. The name of school is greta home no coincidence, its contribution from greta van susteren. 
>> Gregg: Good to know. The west coast is seein temperatures well above average this weekend and people are washington state taking full advantage, trucking in snow for a massive snowball fight. In fact the largest in the world. 6,000 people showing up yesterday and they set a new guiness world record. Maria molina is live. 
>> I wish we had a little snow in new york city. We've been enjoying temperatures well above average and not feeling like winter. We saw temperatures across the NORTHEAST IN THE 40s AND 50s FOR Some of us. That warm weather is going to be coming to an end very shortly. We have a strong cold front off to the west bringing heavy rain in portions of ohio valley down to mississippi and down to louisiana producing flooding out here with as much as five inches or more of rain being recorded in some areas. Very heavy with some of these storms. Taking a closer look, right now, down through mississippi and parts of western tennessee and to kentucky and ohio, will be moving into the northeast. As far as flood warnings, portions in louisiana. Red is flash flood warnings and we do have flooding going on. If you doing traveling in parts of the northeastern louisiana and mississippi, please be careful and do not drive through flooded roadways. We do have flooded roadways across western parts of kentucky and northern parts of ohio. How much more additional rainfall are we talking about? Look at the shades in yellow and orange, still four inches expected because what this front is going to be spreading light rain in portions and in through tomorrow morning. Keep that in mind for monday morning com. It will stay stalled in places like mississippi, tennessee, virginia and north carolina. So'll be dealing with it next several days coming up this workweek. We have a stretch across portions of the southeast. On western side of the storm system, very cold across northern plains, 8 degrees in minneapolis, 19 at rapid city and that cold air is here to stay. Get used to it. You'll need the jackets next several days because it will bottled up across the northern plains. Right now in denver, 10. That warm air we have been enjoying in the northeast coming to an end. Tomorrow still not noticeable in places like new york city but cleveland, only 28 degrees so cold air is going eastward. By the end of next week, cold temperatures in new york city. Taking a closer look at places in northern plains, three degrees in minoit and it feels like ten degrees and 14 degrees below.

>> Gregg: Good news for parents and students looking at their college tuition budge. New report showing that many public universities are cutting the price of tuition in an effort to fight lower enrollment rates due to the bad economy. Is this trend going to continue? Joining us to talk about it is university maryland economist peter morris se789. Half of the declines, why are more young are deciding to forgo college education? 
>> The cost have jumped a lot and the graduates can't find jobs. There is a sense that it doesn't pay out. You get set with a lot of big loans and join the service, learn a trade. Go to a community college and skip university all together. 
>> Gregg: President obama wants everybody to go to college? 
>> It doesn't pay out. Most stated universities offer diplomas that don't lead to a marketable skill. There are too many graduates working at starbucks these days. 
>> Gregg: "Wall street journal" analyzed this way. Take a look at this. Facing stagnant family income, shaky job prospects and a smaller pool of high school graduates, more schools are reining in tuition costs. Is it possible that some tuition costs may actually go down, or we simply talking about slowing the rate of increase? 
>> I think it's slowing the rate of increase. It's less than 20% of the public and private universities and college nationwide. What happened is the top universities have expanded. They basically snatched the students 6 regional schools, small non-endowed colleges and those folks, freezing tuition and giving discounts. They are up against the wall. Big universities have been running up their costs a great deal. They will be hard pressed to cut prices. A lot of. 

[00:20:47]


>>> According to the bureau of labor statistics, since 2001 public and private college tuition has increased a staggering 92%. Think of that. 92% increase. I think one of the main reasons is, what we found in a one our documentary and we spent the better part of a year studying it we found this -- excessive spending by colleges and universities for things like sports teams and elaborate new construction projects for luxury accommodations and fancier facilities and student perks. Ridiculous stuff like climbing walls for hundred people and. You don't need that to go to college, do you? 
>> Absolutely. There is a myth out here we have big time football to raise money for academic programs. Penn state makes money ut the rest lose money. Collegeresidents have given themselves rather grand salaries and building themselves grand houses. If you want to see what a college tuition money is going, it's not with the faculty or nor it's going into espn 2 and college football game day and surroundings of university presidents. You ought to see the staffs they have. 
>> Gregg: It a concrete floor and heater and that was the extent in college. It seems like the colleges and universities are trying to compete with one another for status and prestige which only drives up the cost? 
>> I think they got the values misplaced. What they are about is teaching people basic skills so they have a good general education and think critically and earn a living. They have been involved in a lot of activities and the faculty is not the only to blame. How to measure it is how little you teach. We teach less and less. So we have faculty who are already busy but not busy about teaching but serving on committees, redesigning the curriculum every year. In almost 20 years I've been at maryland, we redesigning the mba curriculum. The universities are not very well managed. I spent a lot of time with CORPORATE CEOs, IAN TELL YOU Universities are not getting the best talent. 

[00:23:20]


>> Gregg: Well said. We'll leave it at that. Peter morrisey, good to see you. 
>> Arthel: New attack in benghazi, libya. The same place where four americans were killed including u.S. Ambassador. We'll tell you which country was targeted this time.

>> Arthel: Bottom of the hour, time for the top of the news, russia's foreign minister calling on syrian rebels to open a dialogue. 60,000 people have been killed there. 
>> Benjamin netanyahu saying he will move ahead with a construction of a new jewish settlement in the west bank. Following the successful palestinian bid for united nations recognition as non-member state. 
>> Arthel: A card carrying italian council coming under fire. The vehicle was armored and the constul escaped unharmed. 
>> Gregg: Some of these companies are taking a pro-active approach to cyber warfare by hiring consultants. Dominic is following the story from west coast bureau. 
>> Reporter: It really is the f.B.I. As the consecutive order to lead the defense against cyber terrorism but companies have come up with ways to thwart attacks. Favorite maneuver to feed wrong information to the hackers to make it doubted what they are dealing with, it confuses them and renderers what they get worthless. This is one effort to combat china and russia who is suspected of bringing down critical infrastructure in the united states. 
>> If this was physical world and paratroopers descended over silicon valley and guys repelled down ropes and went in and grabbed computers and ran out, there would be missiles flying but it happens every day in the cyber security space. Where they come and steal everything and off to some other country they go. 

[00:30:06]


>> That intellectual property could include plans for weapons systems and products, track is torsion is one target. Computer chips and anything that makes america competitive. The sophisticated software that attacks our critical infrastructure is hidden on home computers every day with american citizens to one-day strike. But the better answer the experts say is to make these systems more isolated. We really become too dependent on the connected world, too many using internet at home and making the country vulnerable. 
>> Gregg: Thanks. 
>> Arthel: President obama shaking up his cabinet as he gets set to kick off his second term but three of his top picks could face tough nomination. Chuck hagel will have to answer questions about past comments he made about israel and gays. And john brennan picked to lead the c.I.A. Will have to answer questions to link to enhanced interrogation techniques during the bush administration. Jeff sessions and others coming out against jack lew for treasury-secretary. Sessions says he believes lew 2010 budget testimony before congress was, quote, the most colossal misrepresentation in history. Listen. 
>> I just had one vote on it. I do think the senate needs to push back against this idea that people can come before our committee and say anything they want to inaccurately and two years later want to be promoted to a higher office in our country really in the world. The secretary of treasury and w shouldn't treat that lightly. He needs to be held to account in my opinion. 

[00:32:09]


>> Arthel: In order to get these nominees appointed, will president obama l have on to expend a lot of capital? Former outreach director for john McKay and christy is director of new heights communications. Good to see both of you. Christy, I'm going to start with you today. Should the senate check their concern for higher -- should they focus on checks and balances and go through with tough, full questioning even if it causes more political strife? 
>> No, they shouldn't. I would say what we're seeing now is political feeder and like congress has something like a single digital approval level. Chuck hagel has a 95% chance of getting his nomination through. Brennan and lew have higher percentage than that. What the republican party has been doing up to this point is saying that they have a fight with pretty much every single one of president obama's nominations. Not because they are not qualified or not because they are conservative enough. We are talking about republican nominations just because they are people who have been nominated by the president. 
>> I couldn't disagree with you more. I couldn't disagree with you more. The bottom line president obama has shown himself to be a combative president and no interest in bipartisan compromise. These picks shows that nuclear iran is a threat to israel and he doesn't seem to think we need to put in checks important spending $16.4 trillion debt. I think the american public needs to know who is going to be running the president and executes his policies on day to day on fiscal matters and national security. I think this is good thing. I think the senate should definitely scrutinize it. 

[00:34:19]


>> Arthel: You heard senator sessions, declaring that jack lew must never become treasury-secretary. How does lew make it through the senate hearings? 
>> I think that slew going to have to come forward and explain to people how you can stand up in front of congress and say that the president's budgeted which we really don't have is to say how it doesn't add to our national debt and deficit when we are going to be at $20 trilln by 2016. Jack lew has a lot to answer for but if every democrat votes for him, he needs five republicans to vote for him. Senator sessions is a measured guy. When he makes a comment like this, I really think the senate should pay attention. 
>> Arthel: We're going to go a little bit down the list. J brennan who is the choice leader. C.I.A. Lindsay graham saying they shouldn't confirm until the administrationlab rates the attacks in benghazi. How do you see this playing out? 
>> I think john brennan is going to have the easiest time getng his nomination through. There will be a the couple tough questions from benghazi and also talking about enhanced interrogation procedures. Ultimately those are things that happened under the bush administration. We don't torture anymore. I believe brennan is going to have a significantly and I think at the end of the day the nominations are going to saim through. 
>> Arthel: Go ahead. 
>> I love it when progressives against bush on drones and git more and everything else and doctor gitmor and now more boots on the ground and drones in the air, they are okay with it. I think lew is going to have the hardestime. With brennan and hagel, with a comes out about israel and iran comes forward but I expect a knocked out, dragged out fight over jack lew. 

[00:36:27]


>> Arthel: In terms of approach, how can congress improve on the ratings or is possible to make it worse. The president has an approval rating of 52%. Is there anything in this process that could tarnish his reputation? 
>> Sure. Congress has something, let's remember this president has been elected by fairly comfortable margins. The fact is historically presidents have had the opportunity to choose the people they want for the cabinet post barring some rare situation. Harriet miers nomination of supreme court. The things that congress could learn, don't fight for the sake of fighting. 
>> Senate republicans need to scrutinize the picks and carefully and wisely let's get to the point. The president does not think iran is a threat to the israel and he has no interest in cutting spending in $16.4 trillion debt, basically the cost of gutting the military. President obama needs to get serious about structural entitlement reform and I hope that is what these hearings point out.

>> Gregg: After his arrest, rod blagojevich's face appeared all over the world regrettably but now his wife patty is shoog suing one chicago radio station for use his face on a billboard. 
>> Any citizen is entitled to be compensated for the use of their name, image or likeness for commercial purposes by a third party for their commercial gain. 
>> The speech about a governor, an elected public official in the wake of his conviction for serious crimes. To suggest that people can't talk about him, use his name, criticize him, applaud him in a public forum without paying him, I mean that is sort strikes me as wrong. 
>> Gregg: Does she have a case? Joining me is rich ally david schwartz. Let me say we have not been able to get our hands on the lawsuit itself, but I'm assuming here that she is suing on his behalf as a representative for him. Let's not talk about standing to sue buts this billboard protected free speech or commercial speech which has less protection and require a release from blago or compensation? 
>> That is the distinction, gregg. I think it is commercial speech. This is billboard meant to market a radio station. It's meant to promote a radio station. They are not reporting on the news. They are not using him for a newsworthy purpose. They are using him to market their radio station therefore it's commercial and they need a license. 
>> Gregg: What about this. Supreme court has said this it depends on why you are using an image, such as a commercial purpose you have to have permission. If it is for informational purposes for news you don't. But the case is over. There is noews, isn't it clear that this billboard is to get people to listen to the radio station? 

[00:44:49]


>> Yes. I think that is true, but i think the issue here for me more is why? I think this case is less about justice and more about patty's keeping her 30 minutes of fame here. Illinois has the right of publicity act which protects people. In this case he was news and he is ns. What silz doing and still unsettled law here because this act just recently passed. They have a balance test, free speech under the first amendment versus unauthorized commercialized use of somebody in it. This guy is news. I think is case is phony and i don't think it's going anywhere. 
>> Gregg: I'm not sure. David, this reminds me of the famous abdul jabar case. General motors ad about oldsmobile, jabar is winner and so is old more bill. The court ruled this. We'll put it up on the screen. Although the advertisement provided information, the overall effect was commercial and required permission. Isn't this just the same case. 
>> You've got the wrong one up. You've got namath. It's the same one. Its case by case, each set of facts needs to be looked at. Clearly when you see the image of rod blagojevich up on a billboard promoting a radio station and also have to look at the facts in the case also. The fact that one of the people from the radio station even express they had were using it that their ratings jumped. There is no question it's a commercial purpose and there is no newsworthy function whatsoever. 
>> Gregg: They put up the namath case but it's instructive. It said it defines what news and information really is. It informs and educates, it expresses an opinion and they cited newspapers and magazines and informational websites and books. But that is not the case here, is it? 

[00:47:06]


>> I think you could make an argument that it is. It's a news station. They are saying he didn't listen. Maybe ould and you'll be informed and same thing may not happen to you. 
>> Gregg: What is newsworthy about that. It has nhing to do with his job as governor. 
>> His existence at the time in the state, when this was going on was news in itself would be the argument that I think would be the strongest here. I think also not to be able to speaking about him, talking about him, referencing him, should they have gotten clearance from his family to use his image? Sure, but who is going to care. 
>> Gregg: A judge is going to care. 
>> There is a reason we have these laws, gregg. 
>> The maximum damages in a case like this is $1,000 or proof of actual damages. In the case you are not going to be getting it. 
>> Gregg: If their ratings went up and revenue went up that is measure of damages, isn't it? 
>> It's his brand. They are using his brand to profit. 
>> Gregg: My producer is giving me a hard wrap. Good to see you. 
>> Arthel: Florida senator marco rubio lashing out at president obama. He says the president has made it nearly impossible for any fresh debate to take place.

[00:52:22]


>> Arthel: North dakota senenator marco rubio is laying out his own plan nor immigration recommend. He criticizes the president for executive orders on the issue. He said it would are difficult to keep the conversation going because conservatives have been painted as anti-hispanic and anti-immigration. Joining us is chief of talk radio news service and radio talk show host and fox news contributor. 
>> Happy new year. 
>> Santita you will go first. The senator's assessment is spot on or is there room for negotiations to move immigration policy forward? 
>> I think there is room for negotiation but we have to throw the partisanship out of the window. This is an american dilemma. The fact is half of all illegal immigrants come here ellie and they overstay their -- they come here and legally and they overstay their visas. What we need to do is figure out a way to legally bring people into the country. We can raise the bar but we don't need to erect thearrier. 
>> She says this isn't next necessarily about politics but about people. How crucial is it? In terms crucial for the senator to beut in front for immigration reform considering the republican party needs to get more latinos in its camp? How does rubio make sure they just aren't window dressing? 
>> I think he is the perfect person to be spearheading this. His hispanic heritage makes it authentic. BACK IN 2007 YOU SAW john McCain introducing it and he wasn't trusted by the hisnic community. They didn't look at him a being authentic. I think cube yeo can make a difference this time and pairs with ted crews and obama could do himself a favor if he enlists the help of these border state governors. Guys like rick perry, susan martinez and jan brewer and marco rubio, as well. One thing he is not doing in his proposal that he is probably going to unveil later this year, there is no mention of border security at all. 

[00:54:57]


>> Arthel: Okay, because that is going to veer off. You touched on something that i want to bring santita in on this. That president obama should reach out to some of the border governors likeerry and regardless of party. What do you say about that? 
>> I said at the top of segment they come here legally. Where are the borders really? Of course, we're for the border governors they have an interest in protecting borders but we also have to look at our intake. If you have people that visit this country who just come here and stay and homeland security can't track them, come on, what is going on here? I think the system is broken. Let me finish. That is what we need to do. We need to talk with each other. I think you have a lot of people that need to come to the table, democrats and republicans, people who are one generation removed from being immigrants themselves or many generations into the united states. Let's just have a real conversation about how we can get these people into our country and have them legally become citizens. 
>> I don't think a person like that understands that sees the impact. If you look at rick perry, high understands real human being and doesn't have any draconian theories how to solve the problem. You need a comprehensive situation but you need to enlist republicans to solve the problem. I think rubio, his idea is basically the same as obamas. 
>> Arthel: We'll leave it there. We'll be back in a moment. ] happiness? By the armful? By the barrelful? The carful? How about...By the bowlful?

>> President obama's nominations for critical posts may face the fight of their lives. Does the president have the capital to get them confirmed? >>Gregg: TONIGHT IS Hollywood's unofficial kickoff of the award season. Our golden globes expert is here with his predictions for big winners and losers. 
>> We have a fox news alert. Knifers over the shortage of flu advantage seen in the united states sick americans are overcrowding emergency rooms and the centers for disease control issuing dire health warnings as the flu outbreak is reaching epidemic levels. We are like in new york with more. 
>> Nationally public health officials say some places are experiencing shortages. Patients have to wait on shipments to come in but physicians urge americans to persist because vaccine is still available. According to the centers for disease control and prevention it is 62 percent effective in preventing flu and it takes two weeks to work. Now is the time to get the shot. 130 million doses of flu vaccine have been distributed. So far at least 112 million have been used. Hospitals around the country have seen spikes in flu-related admission and deaths compared to last few years. The strain this year is particularly nasty making people sicker for longer. Employers are doing what they can to keep the workforce healthy and encouraging employees to wear mask. Wash your hands often and disinfect surfaces such as computers and cell phone. It is spread on lanes and trains and commonplaces such as atm and the gas pump handle. 

[01:02:35]


>> All this leads to a higher viral transmission rate. It is easy to get it from surfaces people have coughed on, that touched after they have coughed but the best measure at any time is to perform good hand hygiene. 
>> The flu is wide-spread in 47 
states: Mississippi, california, and hawaii are the only state not seeing a wide-spread outbreak which is designed not only to help patients to get the so the but helps the entire community because fewer spread the virus. Some hospitals are telling all employees they have to get the shots and some have lost their jobs other refusing to do so. >>Gregg: AMAZING. Thank you very much, anna. 
>> Great is new push back fom gun rights supporters turning out in full force outside a popular gun show if -- in upstate new york drawing in dozens of gun control advocates. Listen. 
>> This was an opportunity for us to stand up against gun violence. 
>> I have two small children and sympathize with what happened but unfortunately a lot of times you have a tragedy like that you have an emotional reactionary response. 
>> This is not a black and white issue. Everyone is against massacre.

>> This debate playing out in the capitol where vice president biden will present a list of gun control recommendations to president obama on tuesday. Peter doocy is live in washington with more. >>Peter: THE NATIONAL RIFLE Association president said today he does not think an assault weapons ban could pass congress. SENATOR john McCain doesn't think it could either and john McCAIN EXPLAINED THIS MORNING Why he doesn't think an assault weapons ban should pass congress and he used the overseas example of mass murderer. 

[01:04:41]


>> We obviously have a situation where crazy people, deranged individuals, have access to guns. How do you do that? In norway, a country with the most stringent gun laws, a guy was able to slaughter a huge number of people in norway. We need to look at it in the entirety. 
>> SENATOR john McCain does not believe taking guns away from people will reduce gun violence but he thinks public safety would improve by figuring out a way to keep guns out of the hands of deranged individuals something that the democratic senator murphy agrees with but murphy wants to go further with a strict assault weapons ban. He described that legislation this morning. 
>> It is a tighter ban than the previous ban. It will address high capacity bans. As soon as we passed that ban in 1990's the gun manufacturers found another way around it and other states have stricter bans and that is what the congress needs to do. 
>> In two days, the task force led by vice president biden is going to give president obama their list of legislative recommendations they think could reduce gun violence. The vice president indicated the president could use an executive order to implement some safety measures but republican senator graham said today that such an executive order would encounter bipartisan opposition. 
>> Thank you, peter doocy. Fox news is taking a closer look at gun control debate. Tonight, our very own hannity has a one hour special including new reaction from the new yorkers outed by the journal news for having gun permits at 9:00 p.M. Eastern on the fox news channel. >>Gregg: THEY "OUTED" THOSE Who do not have guns and permits which is compounding a felony, if you will. 

[01:06:46]


>> The honeymoon is over before it started. President obama hasn't even publicly been inaugurated for the second term and there is growing opposition to the second term agenda. Jennifer griffin has more from the pentagon. 
>> First, there will be the confirmation battle. Some will be bruising nothing more so than the pick for defense secretary, chuck hagel. The hearings could start this week. The white house mounted a vigorous defense. Hagel says his record on israel, iran, and gays in the military has been distorted. Senate armed services committee republican said what worried her most is the reaction from iran. 
>> I want to make sure that iran is actually not hopeful but they are fearful as a resultf our nominee for secretary secretary of defense. 
>> Former chair of the joint chiefs and secretary of state powell gave his backing to hagel today even though then senator hagel was one of the largest critics of the iraq war that powell helped sell to the american people. Hagel later tried to stop the surge in iraq calling it the biggest foreign policy blunder since vietnam. 
>> He is superbly qualified based on the overall record and service to the country and how he feels about troops and veterans and families. 
>> The president is gearing up for a fight on three key issues: Gun control, defense budget cuts and immigration reform. On immigration he looks likely to be able to get more bipartisan support with republicans such as senator rub i rubio proposing a path to citizenship for the 12 million illegal immigrants. >>Gregg: THANK YOU, JENNIFER. 
>> Frightening scene at a movie theater. Police shooting and critically wounding a suspected gunman hiding inside. The man confronted his girlfriend in a park lot before pulling a handgun and ducking into the theater. Police searched theater by theater. A witness described the chaos. 

[01:08:56]


>> They checked the back door. It was locked. They did not talk to us. That was not good. Suddenly, I heard to shots. I went to the floor. I went out the back of the theater. We saw police running around. 
>> No moviegoers were hurt. The suspect gunman is expected to survive. >>Gregg: A YEAR SINCE THE Deadly shipwreck off the coast of italy with survivors and families of the 32 victims recognize those lost with a memorial service at the crash site.

Maria: That is right, we have a brand new tornado warning in tennessee associated with the large storm system or strong cold front that has had a history of producing tore anyway activity. Yesterday we had a confirmed tornado in kentucky with confirmed as es-2 tornado with max winds of 120 miles per hour and now a new warning in portions of rutherford and middle, tennessee, and south central wilson county in middle tennessee. Seek shelter. One of the storms is associated with a cold front could produce a tornado right now in your area. Seek shelter in a basement or the most interior room of the home. A storm is also producing other concerns with flooding across ohio, kentucky, tennessee, and portions of mississippi and across louisiana. We had a number of flood warnings in effect up to 3 or 4" reported in a short amount of time so the ground will be saturated and you have flooding recording. Flash flood warning in western tennessee, so flooding is occurring now. That is what "warning" means so it is reported in kentucky and northern ohio. The storm is not done. We expect it to stall out across positions of mississippi, tennessee, and the state of virginia the next several days. Expect three, four, or five inches in the areas especially where we have the yellow in virginia and northeast louisiana. That is additional rainfall on top of what you already have in many of the areas. The notes will have areas of drizzle and heavy rain in some spots tonight and into tomorrow. Several days out here across the east, muggy and humid, and balmy temperatures above average, at 467 right now in new york city, 43 in cleveland, but, the colder air to the west will move eastward and you will feel the chill in the northeast. Minneapolis is eight degrees but with the wind it feels colder. High temperature tomorrow in minneapolis? Only 11 degrees. 17 in denver. Cool in chicago at 27 degrees.

>> The united states is out of the top ten when it comes to the happiest countries. Last year we were number ten. This year we have slipped to 12. Are we just feeling low? We have former chief economist for the united states international trade commission. Hello, peter. It is the first time, how does we slip? What did we do wrong?

>> Welcome buckley said socialism is a system that makes us all equally miserable. Welcome to the america of obama. 25-year-old children living with parents, elderly begging for groceries because they cannot afford their own retirement. I am not surprised. Things have not been going well the last five years. 
>> Let's pull up a survey here. This is a prosperity survey. In is the top ten places to live from number one is norway. Then denmark. Sweden. Australia. New zealand. Canada. Finland. Here is the deal. How do we climb back to the top ten, peter? >>Peter: START GROWING AND Competing more effectively. All of these places compete effectively. It is not whether they have big or small government. Some have big government but what they have that we don't: Effective government that delivers services at a reasonable price. The youngs have national health care. They do it for 50 p less than we do. Their taxes are not so high or their taxes go do help them opposed to paying for mindless bureaucracy. 
>> Norway is number one. Peter, will you renounce your citizenship or america still the best country to live? 
>> Why would I renounce being an american? I have great hope and faith in our country. My feeling is we are the most innovative society and welcomes everyone including my grandfather, a cigar maker if lower manhattan in 1902. This is the greatest place to be in the world. We will get through it. We may need new leadership to do it but we will get there. 
>> I will read this from gerri willis saying the primary reason for the slip in the ra decline in the number of united states citizen would believe hard work will get them ahead. You say what, peter? >>Peter: SHE IS RIGHT. When a president manages to get himself elected by having half of the population pay no taxes and saying I will give you new benefits, by taxing more of the 1 percent because we have a lot of envy and we are jealous, that will encourage people not to work and it will encourage people to have a bad state of mindhether they are paying the taxes or benefiting from the taxes it sends the wrong signal. When you have a president that guides the nation the way this president does, we are going to have a lot of unhappy people and a lot people that don't want to work.

Some of the companies are taking a proactive approach to cyber warfare by hiring cyber security consultants. Dominic is joining us live from the los angeles bureau with more. Dominic? >>Reporter: THIS HOW IS BACK After iran's denial of attacking ten united states banks. Security experts saying iran has joined china in russia in attempting to bring down critical infrastructure. They warn that more traditional groups such as fundamentalists are attempting to attack. Take a listen. 
>> For many years they have tried to impact us through bombs and the like and they see cyber as a new threat and a new tool for them. They are starting to adopt it, calling for electronic jihad. They recognize our country is the on an infrastructure that is inherently insecure. 
>> That is the challenge here. Can companies start from scratch building isolated systems that protect our power supply, banking, and phone networks? One is warning we have to uncouple the networks from the wider internet and the f.B.I. And internet wage their own war. 
>> What is being done offensively is something we do not really know. Defensively in terms of what we are doing, we are, in fact, more vulnerable than a lot of the world but a large reason of that is because our society has become so much more dependent on information technology. 

[01:28:52]


>> The priority, really, is to identify the enemy. That will be extremely hard to do when often the attacks are trying to hide software that hides for years and is activated when the attack attacker wants to attack and is just lying in wait. 
>> Thank you, dominic. >>Gregg: PRESIDENT OBAMA'S Cabinet for the secretary term coming in to sharper focus now with the naming of four crucial positions. That is the easy part. Now, the nominees have to go through confirmation. Given the controversy on capitol hill this could be rough sailing. Get ready for their town in the hot seat. Jack lew foe treasury secretary, and chuck hagel for the pentagon, and john kerry for secretary of state and bolton for c.I.A. Will they all be confirmed? We have john leboutillier, former congressman from new york, and pat caddell, former pollster for president jimmy carter, and doug schoen, form pollster for bill clinton. John kerry has a lock. He is a member the boys' club. The others? 
>> There will be issues and challenges with all three. If I had to bet I bet they all are confirmed and that hagel will be the toughest but ultimately will get through. The larger issue, with brennan going to c.I.A. A with jack lew going to treasury this is the effective consolidation of the white house and the president directly over treasury and c.I.A. And c.I.A. Nominally an independent agency. >>Gregg: THESE ARE CORNER -- Cronies? 
>> Yes and it is worrisome. >>Gregg: PAT, ESPECIALLY HAGEL Who has said to republicans, troubling things about iran, hamas, hezbollah. >>Aid troubling things to democrats and not just republicans and he will be the most problematic. We see president obama and his chief of staff will either be biden's or the deputy of tom donnalyn, all white males, to drop the mask of pretense of bipartisanship, pushing the agenda through and the discussion each of them is what we can do in terms of ignoring the law. But hagel has real problems. 

[01:31:40]


>> John, you have pointed out that republicans are in disarray. Does that make it impossible for them to oppose the nominations? 
>> It makes it harder. The big thing here, the president is consolidating his power and exerting his influence on all the departments. He is entitled to do it but there is no opposition to it. There is no other side. The republicans are crumbling. We have a poll we will put up, the heart of the republican coalition is tea party movement, it is down to only 8 percent of american people from 24 in april of 2010 so that is self-inflicted political suicide. They have shrunk themselves down. The republican narrative, against obama, is not existent that's the vacuum the president can operate in. 
>> Part of what you want in a secretary of defense it strike me, doug, is judgment. Hagel says of the surge in iraq it is the most dangerous foreign blunder since vietnam and, of course, the surge worked so does it call into question on a critical issue his judgment? 
>> It does. I go a step further. Since he has been willing to engage with hamas and hezbollah, since he is opposed not only to the surge in iraq but, also, in afghanistan, he really is for a retreat of american interests around the world. As a republican he is doing the bidding of the democratic left and in that sense it is a change in philosophy, I think, from what has been the prevailing consensus in american foreign policy. >>Gregg: HE IS RIDICULED AS AN Appeaser. That could be unfair. 
>> Let's acknowledge what a hero he was in vietnam I am tires of the excuse, because he serve the honor bring in vietnam and I can name you many who did not who have been in government, but that is somehow a "pass." We are talking about his policy ideas. He is a walking vietnam syndrome which is the notion, and, by the way, it speaks to my belief president obama's actual policy he wants to withdraw from the world and also not supporting israel and, most importantly, and by the way the biggest issue of all, the one I have polls on out the ears, where 80 percent of the american people are concerned about iran, and iran, if they necessity his views they are toxic for the american people. >>Gregg: ON MORE THAN ONE Occasion chuck hagel has said things regarded anti-israel which invites the question is he too soft on iran and too hard on israel? 

[01:34:27]


>> First of all, here is what i predict will happen. When we get close to the hearings he will go and do the courtesy calls on the senate, he goes office to office to office to see each senator. These guys very good at letting the senator who will decide soften things up and he will walk back some of the comments, and when it is offer there will be less white hot opposition. 
>> Can we talk about liw. Did you hear jeff sessions lighting into him saying his testimony was a lie on capitol hill before sessions committee. 
>> I think, though, that lew will be confirmed. There is opposition to him on policy there is not the opposition that hagel is facing. I know lew. He is a good guy. The problem is he is fronting for policies that are not dealing with the debt or the deficit. 
>> Another gold man sacks guy who made a lot of money while the company was being raped. The real problem with lew, he represents the president's worst instincts, he scuttled the deal in 2011 by the introduction of more taxes and he says no, and this is obama on steroids to the left. He is pushing the country in a place that he doesn't have a mandate for but high has no opposition to stop. 
>> Let me say one thing, the shame of these picks is they small. They are inside the beltway, they are small, they are political hacks, where the president wanted to be a transformational president. He has been re-elected. Not many presidents in history are two term presidents and he can be a successful president if he does something great. The great thing he could do for a liberal democrat, is save the social safety net from financial collapse. He had the chance to do it and he still has a chance. 

[01:36:44]


>> Others would have brought some imagination. The opposite of reagan. 
>> Gentleman, hang in here we will come back to new a second. Outgoing secretary of state, hillary clinton, may not have a clear rd to the white house if she runs for president in 2016 with a brand new poll showing one republican may pose a formidable challenge.

A poll asks americans who should authorize gun ownership law and 44 percent say the federal government and 29 percent say state government and 12 percent say the authority belongs to local governments and 16 percent are not sure. Where is the debate going if the president acts on his own which he could possibly do. We will bring back our guests. My guess is he will issue another executive issue. Who needs congress? 

[01:42:01]


>> That is the thing. Congress is not that popular. But we do have have in our constitution the separation of powers. I am a supporter of gun control I am nervous about an effort to bypass the congress. >>Gregg: I AM NOT SURE ANYONE In the white house has read the constitution. 
>> We had a discussion of the $1 translate platinum coin to make a magic coin and make the deficit go away and the white house was seriously considering that. But now treasury says they are now doing that. This is madness what we have going on. Today, some are saying the president should ignore the law and same on gun control. We are not a dictatorship. Some of the actions border on being a banana republic or worse. We have now had people saying the law doesn't matter. On gun control, they miss the boat. Without a big solution that involves schools, mental health, violence, and guns. 
>> Is the republican party on the hot seat? There is a lot of pressure on the white house, capitol hill and the media. 
>> They are but it is on assault weapons. That is, really, the point. It is unreasonable to put a 10-year ban on assault weapons. 
>> It is reasonable but get a national consensus for doing that and background checks and the high capacity magazines off. 
>> We have seen the polls that the wisdom of the people is way ahead of the politicians. They know mental health, the nutty kids sitting in front of a computer watching violent games 
--. 
>> The study on assault weapons said it had no impact. 
>> My daughter welcomes three children under the age of seven, they is worried about security in the schools, too. >>Gregg: FLIG TO WHAT Could happen in 2016. Coming out with the public policy polling hillary clinton well in the lead among democrats and the only republican that is even close is chris christie. Look a jeb bush, he is substantially behind at 37 percent, rubio, also, at 37 percent, weigh in. 

[01:44:23]


>> Well, here is what we seeing. Chris christie because of his bipartisanship during hurricane sandy, speaking his mind, but reaching across the aisle has a constituency in the republican party and I daresay in the nation, that is unique. That is what pat was speaking to when he talked about the wisdom of the american people. >>Gregg: HIS PROBLEM IS HE IS Too glib. 
>> But the speech was overly impacted, and he seeks to this other problems, including the disconnect and he is the only one who is out of washington that people are looking at. 
>> I caution everyone about, it is a long way appear, three years. 
>> But it is interesting how many undecided. But with chris christie it could wear thin over a long period of time. A republican primary, voters have long memories, they are elephants and they remember the convention speech was pro christie, not pro romney and at crunch time in the campaign he helped himself more than he helped romney. There is doubt about christie. He helped obama. >>Gregg: TWO OTHER POLLS, AND One is fun but first the not so fun, 77 percent of americans look at this and think that washington is causing the country serious harm. And a poll finds that congress is less popular than nickel back, a canadian, post grunge rock group but if you include margin of errors, congress is tied with cockroaches. 
>> We have a sense when we see in the last few weeks that congress does far more harm than good on a lost issues and you have a colonoscopy it is not pleasant but it gives a necessary result and I am hard pressed to see what we get from washington. 

[01:46:40]


>> Root canal is the same. The alienation against the political class in washington, congress at the forefront, it is unprecedented now. Yet we do not really speak to it in american politics. Where is congress? 
Where they should be: At home. >>Gregg: I SHIFTED WHEN YOU Said colonoscopy but, look, final word, john, what does this really say about our political system? 
>> What it says is, obviously, people of disgusted with both parties, the whole thing, they cannot stand the bickering and they are looking if someone to come along who is above it and better than it, and a little bit of what pat said, that chris christie tried to speak government. 
>> They want people to come together to solve problems, end the political fighting and consolidation of power. 
>> But they want it on their side rather than the side of a political platform which is what is wrong with no labels, a bunch of insiders pretending to be bipartisan. >>Gregg: GENTLEMAN, OUR Political insiders thank you very much, you and get more at 10:30 a.M.

>> Nice to see you. >>Gregg: BEST PICTURE IN A Drama? 
>> What a lineup, django unchained, life of pie, lincoln and zero dark thirty, a race between argo and lincoln, want out for argo, the hollywood foreign press that votes on these liked argo more, it was come peopling and captivating. They liked "lincoln" but these are foreign joualists and had a hard time following it and not as interesting as argo so it has a chance but watch out for argo. 
>> If lincoln gets best picture who gets best director? 
>> Ben affleck no question, he won a globe 15 years ago foe "good will hunting" and he and matt damon went on to win the oscar. He was nominateed so he cannot win but tonight he will get a big standing ovation. 
>> And talking individuals and their success, what about daniel day-lewis. 
>> He is -- he has won before. He did not win the golden globe for "my left foot" but lost to tom cruise. He is out front. The others are great but --.

>> The globes are voted on by the hollywood foreign press a group of 90 journalist whose cover hole road for overseas publications and the academy award are voted on by 6,000 who vote in the industry. No overlap. But about 65 percent of oscar winners wog the globe first. So winning the globe you get a bump, it is a chance to audition for the oscars so give a great speech and make it seem like it is your year, so like a campaign speech. >>Gregg: NOW, MY TRY TO STUMP You. We do this every year. You know it all on the trivia. I have a couple of things. The only film that has won all final golden globes in the major categories picture, actor, actress?

Flu. America's news headquarters with shannon bream starts right now. Have a great day. 
>> Shannon: A live report coming up from washington on president obama. The debt seal ceiling takes a new turn. Can the president make an run around congress? Some lawmakers saying it should be an option. We'll talk with former governor, haley barbour. Confirmation clash. Republican senator lindsay graham vows to hold up john brennan's confirmation to the cia until we get inching on the attacks in benghazi. And the national cathedral says yes to same-sex marriage, ceiving chee and jeers. We will have a fair and balanced debate. America's news headquarters from the nation's capitol starts right now. President obama's second term hasn't started officially, but the agenda and the cabinet are taking shape. So are some of the clashes over the president's nominations. Jennifer griffin has more on the fights ahead. 
>> Reporter: First, there will be the confirmation battles, many of which seem like they will be bruising. None more thanhe hearing before the senate armed services committee over the new defense secretary, chuck hagel. The hearings could start as early as this week. The white house has mounted a vigorous defense. Hagel says his record on iran, gays and the military has been distorted. Members of the armed services committee will question hagel. But today on "face the nation," SENATOR john McCain called hagel a friend, though he has questions and is annoyed at how the white house has haned the nomination. 
>> Usually wprevious presidents, republican and democrat, when they are considering nominations, they call in the other side and the key members on the other party and say, hey, I am thinking about nominating mr. "X," what do you think about it? There has been none of that. 

[00:02:17]


>> Reporter: The former secretary of the joint chiefings and colin powell gave his backing to hagel, even though he was one of the largest critics of the war in iraq, a war that ell helped to sell to the american people. He tried to stop the surge, calling it the biggest foreign policy blunder since vietnam. 
>> He is superbly qualified, based on his overall record and seferts to his country and based on how he feels about troops, veterans and families. I think he will do a great job as secretary of defense. I think in his confirmation hearings, all of these issues that you have raised -- that others have raised -- he will be prepared to deal with them. 
>> Reporter: The president is gearing up for fights on gun control, deficit reduction, with likely deep defense budget cuts and immigration reform. On tuesday, we will know whether the vice-president will recommend an assault weapons ban. Most doubt he will go that far and will look for stronger background checks. On immigration, the president looks likely to get more bipartisan support, with republicans, such as senator marco rubio, presenting similar measures to create a path to citizenship for the current 12 million illegal americans. 
>> Thank you very much. Senator lindsay graham isn en route to our studio. I will ask him about gun control and the debate and the cabinet recommendations. Send us your questions for senator graham. We will ask him some of your questions. That live interview is in our next hour. In congressional democrats believe it does matter when it comes to the 14th amendment and the debt. Listen to this. 
>> I can say that this administration does not believe that the 14th amendment gives the president the power to ignore the debt ceiling. 
>> Shannon: All right sm. Democrats are pointing to a section that reads that the validity of the public debt of the united states should not be questioned. They say, based on that, they would support president obama, in raising the debt ceiling without congressional approval. Joining me now to talk about that and many other thicks, former mississippi governor, republican, haley barbour. Thank you for coming in. 

[00:04:36]


>> I hope the president doesn't try to do that. To try to take away from the congress the power that the constitution directly gives the congress. That is the power to -- to spend, the power to control the debt. I know that the treasury department has announced they are not going to do it. I hope they stick to that decision because this is -- we should never have a situation where one person-- the president -- can put our country deeper, deeper, deeper in debt. We are doing a bad job of that now. It would be really bad if it was not -- if the congress let their control go. 
>> Shannon: You saw the white house press secretary says it is not something we are going to do or are prepared to do. But we have a all right from dozens of democrats in the house and on the senate side, saying we have to do something if we are faltering. They are saying that the republicans are holding the country hostage if they don't vote for the debt ceiling, saying we need the funds to pay for obigations we have already are incurred and they blame the republicans for the last credit downgrade because they didn't want to vote on the debt ceiling. 
>> President obama voted against increasing the debt ceiling. I find it weeferd that his allies, are saying that the people who do that are bads. We have an interesting time coming up. In the next few weeks in the united states, we have the debt ceiling will get to the point of default. We have the tennessee continuing resolution under which the government is running, expires march 28. The sequestration which was put off two months. If I were at the level of a dictator here, I would take the debt ceiling and push it off to say, june 30. You can't fight all three at the same time. A., I believe the democrats are as scared of the sequestration as the republicans are. There is nothing you can cut on the debt ceiling you can't cut on the continuing resolution. So I would say, mr. President, we are goi to put the debt ceiling off to june 50. Let me tell you why. Between now and then, we are going on cut $3 trillion, $4 trillion -- whatever it is on the continuing resolution and the sequestration. If you stop us from doing that, you areng to put us in a position that the only thing left's the debt ceiling. Let's hope we can work together. One thing, the american people know we don't have a $17 trillion debt because we tax too little. It's because we spend too much. 

[00:07:15]


>> Shannon: That's the debate we heard during the fiscal cliff negotiations and we are going to hear in the weeks and months, as you have outlined. All during the fiscal cliff, all the polling showed that the general public this was the fault of the house republicans, primarily the house side and republicans in congress as a whole. Have you headed up the republican national committee, you know what it is like to sell a message to the american people. Why are the republicans not doing well? They are saying, we are trying to put on the brakes and we are selling out our grandkids. But the public, when polled, blames republicans for this? 
>> One of the things you learn in politics, sometimes the other side gets the bumper sticker and you get the essay. The democratic-controlled senate has not papassed a budget in 3 years. The house republican vtion passed budgets when they have controlled-- the american people are never told that. Why? Republicans don't talk about it enough -- 
>> shannon: Why not? 
>> Well, because they get distracted about other things. We don't have one leader with the megaphone. The in thees -- president obama said this was about taxes, tax, taxes, as you said. Yet after what he -- he got what he wanted and declared victory, the deficit's going up $4 trillion under the fiscal cliff. It is not helping the problem the american people are concerned about. We are having more deficit. Again because the problem isn't about taxes. It's about spending. Republicans have to have campaign communications, strategy, like chinese water torture. It has to be drip, drip, drip. The american people are not dumb. But they need to hear over and over what they already know deep in their hearts. Their family can't spend itself rich and the government can't spend itself rich. 
>> Shannon: We will see all of those things coming down the pike, how the public views it and how lawmakers will respond to the problem. Always good to see you. Happy new year. 

[00:09:19]


>> Happy new year to you and your viewers. The debate is rapid fire as lawmakers weigh in on deadly weapons and our constitutional rights. 
>> The likelihood is that they are not going to be able to get a assault weapon ban. 
>> Taking away the rights of law-abiding citizens will not stop a deranged individual or a criminal. 
>> Someone can walk into a wal-mart, buy a shopping cart full of ammunition, walk out, pay, no questions asked. 
>> Shannon: Very different views on an issue taking center stage. The vice-president is set to make his recommendations to the white house on tohow it put an end to gun violence. And gun owners plan to make a statement. They are not going to take to the streets, to you about gun stores, gun ranges and gun shows to send the president the message to leave the second amendment alone. Thank you for joining me. 
>> Thank you for inviting me. I am delighted to be here. 
>> Shannon: I have to say, some of the reaction I got from the folks talks about this said, maybe this wasn't the best name, maybe second amendment rights day. Why did you cose gun appreciation day? 
>> Because americans appreciate their guns and they understand the value of the second amendment. The individual firearm is a symbol of our from and our liberty. We are asking people to come out to their gun ranges, to their gun storks bring their constitutions, their flags, carry signs and let us celebrate the freedom that we have that is represented in the first and second amendments. Gun celebration day is going to be a celebration of the first and second amendment. >>O. 
>> Snnon: All right. We have had heard suggestions about what the vice-president may present and the common ground of gun rights advocates. And in these recommendations this week, is there anything have you heard about background checks or eliminating certain types of weapons that you think would be beneficial? Or are you more concerned about limits? 

[00:11:28]


>> Well, it's a connection of the slippery slope and the nibbling by a thousand cuts. That's been going on since the MID-90s. If you go back, there is a marvelous clip of senator dianne feinstein, after they passed the original so-called assault weapons ban. And by the way, those are not assault weapons, they are semi-automatics. They are not sawrlt weapons. After they passed that ban, she said, that was the best she could get f. She had her way, she would have banned them all,scooped them all up, she said, turn them all in, mr. And mrs. America. The daily cost has written that's the real agenda, to prohibit the ownership of firearms. It's very clear they will take what they can get and come back for more as soon as that's possible. We are out to defend the seconds amendment. It's a sweeping guarantee of a natural right to own and bear arms and use them in self-defense. That's what we are going to ceate on january 19. 
>> Shannon: Do you find there is a lot of misinformation. When I try to have conversations about this, I find the misuse of words like assault weapons or folks not knowing what that definition means. Do you think there needs to be more education out there? 
>> There does. We need to stand down the rhetoric. It just encourages people on both sides to get engaged in what is professional wrestling. Let's have an adult conversation. Read the assessment amendment. Study why the second amendment was put in there. Remember, this is the second amendment, second only after free speech, religion. The founders took this very, very seriously. This is not an amendment to guarantee the right to hunt squirrels. So it's very important that we have an adult conversation, stop ranting and raving over gun violence. Of course, we all hate gun violence. But for example, let us ask the question, why have we seen the mass shootings that we have? It is not the law-abiding citizens, using their guns. In fact, there is a very close connection with psychiatric drugs. I have a forbes column I wrote that should be appearing very soon, it draws the connection between the presence of these psychiatric drug, people -- those so-called lone wolf shooters, especially the young people who are on these psychiatric drugs, anti-depressants or in withdrawal from them, why isn't congress holdg hearings on this? Rather than pulling the nra do into these meetings and brow-beating them over exercising a right that the founders guaranteed, why not invite the pharmaceutical companies into capitol hill and see if we can find the connection between these psychiatric drugs and the murder ags rages that they send some people into. 

[00:14:31]


>> Shannon: Larry hunter, spokesman for gun appreciation DAY ON THE 19th. Many, many angles need to be discussed. We know those who are planning counter activities to what you have. We will see how it plays out on THE 19th. 
>> Thank you. 
>> Shannon: Join sean hannity for a one-hour special, as he talked to legal gun owner who is were publicly identified by a new york newspaper. He talks to them about their personal safety fears and what every gun overowner can do to protect their second amendment right. The nra's idea to place armed guards in schools may be gaining traction in texas. The lieutenant governor is proposing intensive training for teachers, in which each school district would decide who carries in the classroom. 
>> The state ought to put up the funds for robust training for the personnel that the independent school district approves to carry a handgun in a school, so that they will know what to do and they won't hurt themselves and harm any children 
>> it's it's unclear if anything has been proposed forty. But a similar bill failed in 2011. A former army staff sergeant known for his epic valor in the afghan war is the fourth living recipient for actions in iraq or afghanistan. President obama will present the award to clinton ramesha next month, saying me and fellow soldiers were surrounded by dozens of enemy fighters and fought back bravely and he took out an enemy machine gun team, despite his injuries. Coming up, ousted egyptian president hosni mubarak tries to get out of a life sentence for allowing protesters to be murdered. D feverish, coughing, achy flu is sweeping the country.

Speaking after rotesters were moved from the construction site, president netanyahu planned his support for the project to deepen eastern islam's separation from the west bank. Both want a state for their own. 
>> We understand that a hearing will be held soon. We call on iranian officials to respect iran's own laws and provide access to an attorney. 
>> Shannon: The state department publicly responding to the plight of an american pastor trapped in an iranian prison. He has american citizen help and has come under attack in iran for being a christian. He has been jailed since september. We have been following the story closely here. The american center for law and justice has been working to free the pastor. His trial judge is notorious for giving people the death penalty. They are publicly calling on the state department to do more. What happens when religious beliefs conflict with secular societieses?

>> Shannon: The issue of gub violence is on the agenda in washington this week issue as the vice-president will release his recommendations to the president. 
>> Reporter: Appearing on a sunday talk show, the president of the national rifle association said congress won't pass a new assault weapons ban or a restriction on high-capacity magazines. But democrats maintain the newtown massacre is causing a sea of change and that gun rights advocates need to compromise. An indicted utah businessman is trying to tie senate majority leader harry reid to an alleged bribery scream. Ger jeremy johnson, chark wednesday money laundering and bank fraud said that the utah attorney general set up a deal for him to pay more than a half million to reid to make a federal investigation go away.

>> Shannon: Aren't you going to tell them about your mr. America finalist? 
>> Reporter: That's not real. 
>> Shannon: All right. Thanks. A momentary reprieve from ousted president hosni mubarak, ordering a retrial. It's been nearly two years, since mubarak was sentenced on the charges, he failed to prevent the deaths of hundreds of protesters in the uprising in the protest that tossed him out of power. 
>> Reporter: Today's acquittal is the latest from a long line of twists and turns in egypt, since the two-year-long political transition got underway. There were loud ryes in the courtroom. Mubarak supporters celebrated inside the courtroom and outside the courthouse, saying long live justice. Defense lawyers argued that mubarak didn't help the killings -- didn't issue the killings of those protesters and didn't know of the killings so he couldn't have prevented them. The judge aagreed and overturned the convictions. But both mubarak and his former chief of security will be retried, along with several others who were acquitted in the first trial. No date has been set for a retrial. Right now, mubarak remains under watch and is in a military prison in egypt. He will stay there for the foreseeable future because he's also facing corruption charges. Now, just a few months ago, mubarak was reportedly near debet. He had fallen and injured himself. We deponent know what state mubarak is in. The last two yrs have seen a lot of change and turm noil egypt. It is unlikely that this new announcement, the overturning of the conviction will do little to stabilize egypt going forward.

>> Shannon: Thank you, live from jerusalem. Thank you, connor. A chough in livingston county, kentucky, was destroyed after severe weather swept through the western part of the state. It was severely damaged. A grain silo also toppled in heavy winds and rain and nasa officials are trying to determine if a tornado hit the town or if the damage was from strong winds. The worst flu outbreak in recent history has families in a frenz tow get their shots, in order not to become an alarming statistic. We have more on this important story. 
>> Reporter: Hey there. I can tell you some hospitals are telling all workers, they must get the flu shot. Some employees have lost their jobs over refusing to do so. Nationally, public health officials say some places are experiencing shortages, patients are waiting on shipments to come inform but physicians are urging americans to be consistent, because vaccine is available. According to the cdc, the vaccine is 62% effective in preventing the flu this year t. Takes two weeks to work. So now is the time to get the shot. Nearly 130 million doses of flu vaccine have been distributed. So far, at least 112 million have been used. Hospitals around the country have seen spiked in flu-related admissions and deaths compare to the last 3 years. This year's strain is particularly nasty, making people sicker for longer. Employers are doing whatever they can to keep their workforces healthy, some handing out masks and encouraging employees to wear them. Physicians caution everyone to wash hands often and disinfect computers and cell phones. The virus is easily spread on planes, trains, escalators and the handle at the gas pump. 
>> All of this leads to a higher viral transmission rate. It's easy to get it from surfaces that people have coughed on it and touched after coughing on theirpeneds. So the best preventive measure at any time is to perform good hand hygiene. 

[00:31:38]


>> Reporter: The flu is widespread from 47 states, accord to the cdc, mississippi, california and hawaii are the only ones not seeing a widespread outbreak. The vaccine is designed to help peoples who get the shot. It also helps overall for the entire community because fewer people are contagious and spreading the virus around. Back to you. 
>> Shannon: I never thought abgas pump. That's a good point. 
>> Reporter: Carry your sanitizer. 
>> Shannon: Thank you. Our nation was built on religious tolerance, but many feel their religious freedom is under attack. It were, stanford university's law schol is holding a first of its kind clinic, taking on clients of any faith. It is funded in part by the becket fund for relirks liberty. We have a representative from the becket fund with more. Thanks for your time today. 
>> Thank you. We at the becket fund are so excited to be here. 
>> Shannon: Tell bus this clinic, yuthink it's necessary and the kind of work it will do? 
>> The clinic will be training students, law students, how it practice law with representing real clients from a diverse background of religious faith and before real judges and courts and defending the free expression of all religious traditions. 
>> Shannon: What kind of cases are you seeing that you felt it was important to fund this effort to make sure that future lawyers will be trained to handle this? 
>> We at the becket fund have seen a dramatic increase in persecution against people of faith. This is not about who god is,b it is about who we are. And people of faith should be able to express themselves at home and in church and in the public square, at their job site and wherever they live, wherever they practice their faith. 
>> Shannon: I know that the becket fund has been a key player in a number of the challenges to the hhs contraception mandate from the administration, the hobby lobby case that everyone is watching, the biggest employer challenging this. Is that a prime example, where we come to this collision between secular policy and law and deeply held private religious beliefs? 

[00:33:59]


>> Absolutely. We are representing hobby lobby and we are representing several nonprofit client who is have seen this administration try to impose -- violate their religious beliefs. This is extraordinary. Only 20 years ago, it was brought bipartisan support on the hill and the most important piece of religious liberty legislation last. Americans stood food firmly on behalf of religious frill. We have never seen the government try to violate those religious convictions with the hhs mandate and the rights of pharmacists not to have to distribute drugs that they have opposition to and to say the words under good god in the pledge of allegience. 
>> Reporter: There has been a lawsuit on the visitor capitol buildings and others. There are more and more challenges going on. How do we get to where we are now, where there is a need to staff up and be prepared to fight back? 
>> There is a great confusion about what is the true nature of religious liberty. The government is not supposed to interfere with what is in here and what is in here. My parents came from cuba and came as many immigrants did, understanding that their beliefs would be respected in all aspects. However, there is a great misunderstanding that expressing those religious convictions and those beliefs outside of the home has become something that is offensive. There is no law against being offended. It is part of what we are. When there is a jazz concert, people don't cover their ears and decide it's government endorsing a particular type of music. We have an understanding of religion as part of who we are, part of our culture. The state did not grant those rights, so the state cannot take those away. 
>> Shannon: You are involved in a number of issues, and that's what this clinic will be about, with all viewpoigns and all religions. We will stay tuned as this launches tomorrow. Thank you for your time. 

[00:36:10]


>> Thank you so much, shannon. 
>> Shannon: Two senators from both sides of the aisle say they have very tough questions and concerns about former senator chuck hagel. The man the president wants to head the defense department. THAT'S NEXT.have to ask you to power down your little word game. I think your friends will understand. Oh no, it's actually my GEICO app...see? ...I just uh paid my bill. Did you really? From the plane? Yeah, I can manage my policy, get roadside assistance, pretty much access GEICO 24/7. Sounds a little too good to be true sir. I'll believe that when pigs fly. OK, did she seriously just say that? GEICO. Just click away with our free mobile app. doing? Nothing. Are you stealing our daughter's school supplies and taking them to work? No, I was just looking for my stapler and my... This thing. I SAVE MONEY BY USING FedEx GROUND And buy my own supplies. That's a great idea. I'm going to go... We got clients in today.

[00:40:34]


>> Shannon: If you own a computer, listen up. The department of homeland security is warning you to temporarily disable goaf a. There is a flaw in the software that could make you vulnerable to criminal activity. Oracle, the owner of java, says the problem will be fixed soon. 
>> We have a lot of questions to answer about this. I am deeply troubled by t. I also wonder what message are we sending to iran? What message are we sending to israel? I am perplexed that the president has nominated him. 
>> I want to ask questions about those positions. I am not comfortable -- yet -- i want to ask him questions about those two issues. 
>> Shannon: Senators kelley iiot and richard blue menthal are both apprehensive about the president's choice for secretary of state. I sat down with chris wallace to chat about that revealing conversation. The president has offered up a number of nominations for key positions and you had two senators to talk about the nominations of former senator hagel. 
>> That will be a tough nomination. We had two members of the armed services committee, which will hold hearings. Iiot is very concerned with the positions that hel has stated and voted in years as a senator on iran, on israel, on defense cuts, on a variety of issues. And she indicated that at this point, that she is leaning against him. And he is going to have to persuade her in one-on-one meetings, the nominees meet with each of the members of the committee and in the committee hearings. But she said, he's going to have to do some convincin richard blue menthal expressed concerns. He's a dm. But he predicted at then of the day, we will get through. But when you hear somebody like chuck schumer, the number 3 man in the senate democratic leadership, particularly on the issue of israel because, of course, hagel talked about the jewish lobby and has said that -- israel this shnegotiate with hamas. He won't endorse him and said, i will wait to be persuaded. I think of all the nominees, i think this is the only one in jeopardy. 

[00:43:03]


>> Shannon: You talked about the senates and the panel, all of these were expecting word from the vice-president with regard to gun control laws on tuesday, more or less, tightening up what we have. Do you think congress is ready to make any substantive changes to what we have now? 
>> Let me give you a couple of facts that I learned this week, setting up for the program. 1; last year, in the 2012 election cycle, the nra contributed $20 million to federal candidates, people running for congress and for president. Gun control groups, $20 million for the nra, $4,000 for the gun control groups and more than 50% of the members of the new congress get an "a" rating for the nra. So that's a sense of the clout that the nra has. I think if anything happens, legislatively, there will be regulatory changes and executive action, if anything happens, it will be smaller, rather than bigger. I think it will be a very hard row to eliminate assault weapons and high-capacity magazines. 40% of all gun sales, there is no background check, maybe if not universal, you will see expansion to that. 
>> Shannon: We will see what recommends out. Thank you for the preview of your show. 
>> You bet. 
>> Shannon: The exclusive interviews and watch "fox news sunday" right after america's news headquarters. Chris and leaders of gun groups from both sides tackle the debate over the seconds amendment.

>>>> Shannon: President obama and key senate republicans, heading into a grinding personnel fight. Top republicans are promising to block some of the president's nominees, until they get answers about the deadly 9/11 benghazi terror attack. 
>> This administration's stonewalling the congress, trying to get benghazi and they're behind them politically in their rear-view mirror. 
>> I am going to stand firm to get the basic answers that should have gone given to the congress months ago. 
>> Shannon: Senator lindsay graham line. A florida homeowner says it's grand theft real estate. He was told he has to hand over a chunk of his property to the government and pay thousands for repairs on public land that is miles away. The property owner is here, live. And same-sex couples can merin the washington national cathedral. Some traditional marriageo advocates are outraged. Fair and balanced. The chairman of the national organization for marriage joins us, as well as the dean of the national cathedral. Time for a look at the top stories we are following. The centers for disease control and prevention, says doctor visits for flu visits are way above the baseline. 47 states are experiencing widespread flu activity. Cdc officials are still calling this a moderate season. There will be no platinum coins to avoid the increase in the debt limit. That saying that it doesn't believe minting a $1 trillion coin will do anything. They are taking extraordinary measures to keep paying the nation's bills without further borrowing. If you feel tense, throw a no ball -- thens of people in seattle, hoping to thack make their mark in the guinness book of world records, turning out for the largest ice-flingingght in history. That snow was shipped in from the mountains for the icy showdown. It is not the flu, about the air they are breathing, launching red alerts in china. Residents are told to stay inside, as the air quality has hit the worst level since officials began tracking air pollution. We go live for the details from banke bangkok. 

[00:50:57]


>> Reporter: Yes, china's capital is notorious for bad pollution, but today was one of the worstver. The smog seemed to envelope the whole of the city, making it dangerous for the people there. The beijing municipal environmental monitoring center is recommending that children and the elderly stay indoors, despite the danger of beijing streets were busy today. People, of course, get use to the smog. But I know friend who is live there and when the cloud comes down, they try to stay home and switch on the air purifiers. The pollution figures are staggering. Plugs is measured in the amount of small particulates in the atmosphere. According to the beijing super, they surpass 700 micro crograms per cubic meter n. Context, the world health says it's cive to have just 25 micrograms. There has been a controversy to see if the readings were accurate or they were trying to understate the problem and give lower readings. The u.S. Embassy publish its own data on twitter and commented that the readings were beyond index. The highest number it got on the data was the equivalent of a massive 886 micrograms per cubic meter. The u.S. Environmental protection agency's air quality index would easily categorize them as emergency conditions. The people of beijing have been getting increasingly concerned abour quality in the city. The middle class, particularly concerned about it. But, of course, the major factor is the rapid industrialization of beijing over the last few decades. Also, a massive increase in cars, and also, at this time of year, increased use of heating oil, all bringing up this smog that is enveloping beijing today. They are saying it won't clear, shannon, until tuesday. Back to you. 

[00:53:00]


>> Shannon: Wow, the pictures of amazing. Thank you for the update. One of the most liberal states on gun policy may provide insight into how far the country as a whole might be willing to go in changes to gun laws. Details after the break. men drivers? Yeah. Then how'd I get this... 
[ voice of Dennis ] ...SAFE DRIVING BONUS Check? Every six months without an accident, Allstate SENDS A CHECK. Ok. 
[ voice of Dennis ] SILENCE. Are you in good hands? 

[00:56:53]


>> Shannon: As the debate over gun violence rages some officials considering changes at the state level. California has some of the toughest firearms laws in the country. Fox news correspondent claudia cowen has the story. 
>> Reporter: Buying a handgun in california is no sem many task. It requires registration, a safety certificate, a ten day waiting period and rigorous background check. All direct person to person sales are banned and concealed care arery permits are rare. The state routinely redefines and bans so called assault weapons, limits the number of firearms purchased by individuals, forbids opening carrying and has strict bb gun regulations. 
>> California is the most gun controlled state in the country. Number one. 
>> Reporter: Now, the golden state is moving to enact even more restrictions. 
>> Almost any idea that anybody in this country has as to how to further regulate and limit access to weapons or ammunition is probably going to get passed in california. 
>> Buying bullets should not be easy. 
>> Reporter: Some politicians want to regulate all ammunition sales requiring background checks and annual permits. Democratic state senator are aims to ban a feature that he says makes some guns like this ar 15 rifle easier to reload. 
>> What we are trying to do with our particular bill is to basically ban that particular weapon because it is in fact a loop p hole in the assault weapon ban. 
>> Gun owners say lawmakers are overreaching and trying to assert power. 
>> They know that as long as there s an armed populous in the state they will never control the people the way they want to control them. 
>> Reporter: Gun owners vow to lobby state lawmakers here rally citizens across the state and take their fight to court if need be. Other states will be watching closely to see how far california can bump up against the second amendment and whether any gun control laws can actually make a difference. In sacramento, claudia cowan, fox news. 

[00:59:10]


>> There are millions upon millions of americans who value the rights that they have under the second amendment. 
>> I want every nra member he. I want every law abiding gun owner to know their second amendment rights will not be infringed upon. 
>> Shannon: Driving the news this week the debate over gun rights as vice president biden gets set to make recommendations to the president on gun violence. Peter doocy has the latest from washington. 
>>> Two days from right now we will know what the task force vice president biden has been leading will recommend to president obama as a legislative means for reducing gun violence. That the point, speculation has been that the administration will seek to restrict a weapons and high capacity magazines in some way but the nra does not think that is a a good idea. 
>> We wished that instead of talking about guns specifically that they question that they would have addressed is what do we do to prevent these kinds of things in the future. And the evidence shows that an assault weapons ban or all of these things are not going to do that. What will do I is doing something about a broken mental health system that allows people who are potentially violent to be on the streets. 
>> Keene also said he doesn't think there are are enough lawmakers in congress who favor an assault weapons ban to get one passed but groups like the center for american progress question how much clout the nra really has. 
>> The nra spent a lot of money on the elections last cycle and they he didn't have a lot to show for it, especially if you look at the senate. So a lot of their candidates lost. They had -- if we are looking at return on investment they had a very low return on investment but you, of course, the nra is a very strong lobby. I think the issue is who is going to represent the voices of the american people in this debate. 

[01:01:12]


>> Democratic senator chris murphy from connecticut thinks the mass murder at sandy hook elementary school in his state last month changed the public opinion about gun control but the alternate argument was made this morning by former republican governor haley barbour from mississippi who said on meet the press he thinks if you make it a crime to have a gun only criminals will have guns. 
>> Shannon: Thank you. Republicans and democrats alike have expressed concerns over the president's choice to head the defense department. Former senator chuck hagel and the treasury about pick jack lu is facing road blocks as well. Joining us to talk about that with his insights and more, chris stirewalt, host of power play on fox news .Com 11:30 a.M. Eastern monday through friday. 
>> That is all accurate and much appreciated. 
>> Shannon: Thanks for coming in on sundays well. 
>> You bet. 
>> Shannon: Senator lindsey graham calls it an in your face pick by the president. Tell us what are the main stumbling blocks he will face? 
>> Hagel has two sets of problems. One set relates to the fact that he is a -- he would not be a good choice for secretary of state. He is not -- that is not his bag. He has been outspoken and blunt and prides himself on being mavericky and outspoken. On the one side the things that he said about the state of israel and the united states relationship thereto cause him bipartisan problems with supporters o israel because of things he said that seemed to take sort of an even handed approach to the arab israeli conflict and that is not something that is okay with people who believe that there they are our most important most valuable ally in that region and we he have a special relation shell with them. Ha is problematic. He said some things about gay folks that he has since walked back and is sorry about that. Then the issue on the right and that is the fact that he anding and and antagonized his own party. Called it the greatest mistake since the vietnam war and itented up working and benefited barack obama to a huge degree. People like lindsey graham recent the way he conduct himself. They think he is wrong on foreign policy and wrong to want to cut the defense department. 

[01:03:48]


>> Shannon: There is oust and deferens to the president's -- there is often a deferens to the president's picks. 
>> We will call it 92.5% likely that he gets through. There will be loud noises made and tables pounded and senator hagel will apologize for the things that he said that upset democrats. I have a hard time seeing the republicans breaking their pick on this issue. Jack lew maybe. 
>> Shannon: Let's talk about that. I talked with senator jeff he sessions and he did not qualify his language at all, calling jack lew a liar saying he testified about the president's policies andlans for the economy and said there is not going to be any more deficit. Sessions said to me he lied to congress, there is no way he should be the treasury secretary. 
>> There are people who say things all the time in washington who make lots of noise about stuff. Jeff is sessions is not one of those guys. 
>> Shannon: He is very measured. 
>> A measured person and the ranking republican on the budget committee in the senate. When you start talking that way you can't walk that back. The way people talk about hagel they usually leave trap doors i want to hear him say the following things but you start to hear the unequivocal things about lew. Jack lew was the negotiator seven ram times through the ongoing debacle that we call government finance and the republicans don't trust him and they dislike him and think he is is liberal and remember this the republicans are divided when it comes to dense. Some are hawkish, some are more libertarian and looking to pull back. So the republicans are divided on that. They all think we need to cut spending so jack lew could face a much more united front from the gop. 
>> Shannon: We shall see. Chris stirewalt, see you you at 11:30 a.M. Eastern tomorrow. 
>> Shannon: Senator lindsey graham has been talking tough on the debt ceiling and the president's newest nominees. I will ask him about that and some of your questionss well. If you have is a question for senator graham tweet us. Our exclusive interview with senator lindsey graham coming up. 

[01:06:03]


>>> The mayor of los angeles has definite ideas about how president obama can help bring about what he calls meaningful immigration legislation. Speak on "face the nation," he says he s heartened by the bipartisan cooperation he is seeing on the issue and laid out his own ideas. 
>> You have to have the pathway that allows folks to glenn conticello full citizens. The make sure you get at the end of the lien that you you pay your taxes and have a background check. In the end we he have to make sure that these people have a pathway to citizenship. U can't do this in a piece meal way. 
>> He will be leaving later this year because of term limits. He has issues sights set on statewide office. 
>>> Planned parenthood reported record-breaking numbers after year. At the same time it announced performing a record high number of abortions planned parenthood revealed it received more than a half billion dollars in taxpayer money during the last fiscal year prompting prolife advocates to sound the alarm. 
>> The average person thinks we should not be borrowing more money so we can pay for abortions. 
>> Shannon: Prolife lawmakers reintroduced legislation aimed at blocking family planning funding that will go to any group that does not certify that it doesn't perform abortions. Planned parenthood says more than 90% of its services are preventive care and we are reimbursed by thgovernment for providing specific preventive services to low income patients. Federal funds are not and cannot be used to provide abortion. Planned parenthood's own statistics showed over the last three years it performed a million abortions at a consistent annual rate. During the same time period the organization also had a nearly 30% drop in cancer screenings and more than an 11% drop in contraceptive services. Funding battles brewing as a number of states have fought to block planned parenthood from access ising their funds. The obama administration has often stepped in, either directly funding the organization itself or threatening to withhold federal funding from the states unless they reverse their decisions. 

[01:08:27]


>> Every time we defund on the state level the president steps in and says over my dead body. 
>> Shannon: Joining us to talk about this, congress woman marsha blackburn. She has reintroduced a bill that would block federal funding to planned parenthood under title nine. Thank you for joining us today. 
>> Good to be with you. 
>> Shannon: Excuse me, title 10. What is title 10. 
>> Part of the 1970 act done through hhs and what they do is direct funding for women's health services. What has happened through the years is planned parenthood has moved to abortion services and, indeed, this past year, shannon, they got $542 million from the federal government. That is taxpayer dollars. They did 335,000 abortions and that is one abortion every 94 seconds. And we are just saying look, you know, you you do not need to be using this money, money is fungible and we need to cut federal funds going to planned parent hood. 
>> Shannon: I talked with planned parenthood about the new record numbers and they said no federal taxpayer money has ever been used for abortion. It cannot be. It will not be and their argument is they are providing essential health services to women that they are not going to be able to get elsewhere are if the government cuts off funding. 
>> But the problem with that is if you go to planned parenthood for a mammogram they refer you. So they are making these referrals and even now as some of the states have stepped in to begin to cut the funding to planned parenthood then you have the federal government stepping back in but again you you have got planned parenthood putting the focus on abortion services, indeed, requiring all of their affiliates to do abortion services in 2013. 
>> Shannon: That was something new that I learned in putting the story together. Something I hadn't realized. Basically the parent organization is saying to the franchises if you don't provide abortion services you can't be affiliated with planned parenthood. 

[01:10:37]


>> And that is of concern to us. They are away from what their original mission was and we are very concerned that the focus is on abortion services. We do not want federal money taxpayer money to be used for abortion services and what we have learned from former employees at planned parenthood and individuals that have worked with them is all that money is fungible. When you are anrganization that gets 45% of our revenue from the federal government and when you have 1.2 bullpen north $1.2 billion in assets you do not need taxpayer funding. 
>> What is your handicapping of success for this in the house and even if you are successful there what about the senate? 
>> I think we are going to do really well. We will have a bill come forward in the senate so we will be bicameral in that regard. We have a letter that has 29 groups supporting this. This letter has already been sent to our colleagues' offices. We do expect that we will have bipartisan support on it. The issue will come before us at committee. I think we will move it through committee and move it through the house and quickly move it over to the senate side and we are expecting bipartisan support there also. 
>> I wanted to ask you about that how you many democrats may be willing to sign on, cosponsor or at least gar ran fee you a vote on this. 
>> I think that we will see enough to say this is a solid bipartisan bill. There is so many of my colleagues in the house who are very concerned about this and, you know, quite frankly, shannon this is an issue where fiscal and social conservatives agree that you do not need to be using taxpayer dollars to pay for abortion services. 
>> Shannon: And again, planned parenthood tells us they don't so we will watch as this plays out. Always good to see you. Thank you. 
>> Good to see you, thank you. 
>> Shannon: An iranian pastor is, once again, free after a second stint in an iranian prison because of his christian faith. He was released after being held for two weeks. We covered this story when previously he was h held for are a thousand days and sentenced to death. He was freed. Despite the recent release the pastor still is not completely safe there in iran. 

[01:13:04]


>>> The state department has been responding for the first time this week to the plight of an american pastor trapped in prison there. A spokesperson for the state department says thes hopes iranian officials will respect their own laws anden sure that the pastor will have access to an attorney. He is being held because he is a christian. The american center for law and justice has been working on both cases trying to free the pastor and is concerned about his future. He has been assigned a trial judge who is notorious for giving the death penalty.

>> Shannon: A florida land owner are will get his day at the u.S. Supreme court this week in a bat that will spanned nearly two decades. When asked for a permit to develop his land the government entity with jurisdiction said sure as long as you give us a portion of that land and agree to pay thousds of dollars to develop a tract of the land that the government owns miles a I way not even related. Is this a government shakedown or completely legal. Joining us, coy coons, jr. And his attorney who will argue the case this week. Welcome both. 
>> Thank you for having us. 
>> Shannon: This case actually was started by your father. He has since passed away and you now are continuing this fight. Why was it so important to keep fighting almost 20 years into this? 
>> My father always said the only way you lose a fight is if you quit fighting so and he did pass away in 2000. The fight started in '94 and hopefully we are at the last stage of it. So but he fought all of his life like many people in this country and he enjoyed developing land. 
>> Shannon: And he had a real difficult choice here. I mean paul, a lot of people argue not much of a choice. The government said basically you give us part of the land that y own and miles away we have this other piece that we own and we want you to pay for doing repairs and development to that. For a lot of people that sounds like it is not a legit request. 

[01:19:53]


>> We don't think it is. The court has to decide whether the government can use the permitting process to leverage property out of property owners. In this case financing 50 acres of public wettelands offsite if you can imagine that and an 11-acre conservation easement on his property. Here we are almost 20 years later fighting the fight. 
>> Shannon: The government the will say it has a right and interest in making sure that wetlands and different protected areas remain protected and they have a right to control the permitting process and how it plays out because they have to take care of the environment. 
>> And our response to that s we have no problem with the protection of the environment and wettelands but if it is a public good the entire public should have to pay for it. You shouldn't force one property owner to bear the entire burden of playing for that. 
>> Shannon: To get the permit that he wants to fix the land. Do you you feel like you you have is taken on something that is a bigger fight for all americans, all landowners. 
>> Definitely. This affects, of course, not only us and we are in the final stages but it affects any one in the state of florida who owns property. And as far as that goes in this country who owns property because if you assuming that we do come through this successfully it will at least hopefully stop this flood of government regulation and taking land. 
>> Shannon: At this point do you feel like it is a fair fight, the individual land own oar versus the government? Do you feel like there is a balance of pthere or not? 
>> If I had warren buffett's money it would be fair. There are two aspects. Number one the financial and number two the time. Many people do not have the time. They want to do what they want to do. We are into the 19th year of this. Many people do not have that anywhere close to that kind of time and they certainly do not have the money to fight the government. And like I say, hopefully we are at the final stage. Mr. Beard here with pacific legal foundation has been working on this for over a year. 

[01:22:07]


>> Shannon: The average person could never fund something to this level. 
>> That is the problem really is that most property other thans will swallow whatever unconstitutional provision the government imposes. We are there standing next to coy koontz and hopefully we have a good day on tuesday. 
>> Shannon: We will await the justices' opinion in this. I know that anybody who owns any piece of land in this country will be tuned in and interested. 
>> A few seconds for a quick story? 
>> Finish this up. Nine years ago we left one of the hearings and got into an attorney with two attorneys working for us and three folks from st. John's water management district one turned and said if you want the land why don't you simply pay him for it and she looked at him and said why should we pay him for it when we can just teak it for him. That crystallizes the 19 years. 
>> Shannon: Stunning words and nothing you want to hear from the government. 
>> That s your government hard at work. 
>> Shannon: Yeah, it is. Thank you both. 
>> We wanted to give you an update that we brought to you you on america's news headquarters last fall. An administrators a gallaudet university has now been reinstated.

>> Shannon: Vice president joe biden is set to release his recommendations for reducing gun violence to the president this week. Appearing on a sunday talk show the president of the national rifle association predicted congress will not pass a new assault weapons ban or a restriction on high capacity magazines but democrats maintain the newtown massacre is changing attitudes on capitol hill. 
>>> President obama sworn in for his second term next week. Today preparations already are underway in the u.S. Capital. The inauguration is expected to be smaller this year than it was in 2009 but will still fee he tour a star studded lineup and enthusiastic mood but tempered by high unemployment and a still faltering economy. If you are feeling tense, here is an idea gaining momentum. Get out there and throw a snowball. Thousands in seattle turning out for the largest ice slinging fight. The nation's most prominent implementing a new and controversial policy. The washington natnal cathedral will soon begin allowing same-sex marriages. The church will be among the first episcopal congregations to unemployment lement the new right of marriage. It care areries huge symbolism and advocates of traditional marriage say in their opinion it is the wrong move. Joining us is john eastman and reverend gary hall dean of the national cathedral. We will be he begin the conversation with dean hall. Thank you for joining us. Why this decision, why now? 
>> The episcopal church has gone through a 20 year process trying to decide what to do how to offer gay and lesbian parishonners the tools for living a faithful life and at last year's general convention it approved this right that we are going to use which co??ld be adaptable for areas where there is same-sex marriage legal and washington, d.C. And parts of maryland now which s our diocese is is legal in all parts of our diocese and so that is one thing. And so we felt really it was the time and that we were going through it as what a congregation would do in the nation's capital. It has been perhaps a larger symbolic thing than we perhaps thought it might be. 

[01:30:27]


>> Shannon: A lot of reaction on both sides to this. National cathedral viewed as a house of faith for people of all faiths and different denominations and religions and a gathering point and co-alessing point for americans. How do you answer the americans who say for me personally my faith conviction is that it isn't the right thing to do and yet here is this national monument for all faiths that s going to move ahead with something? 
>> There is always a tension between pub live and private morality. And for christians morality is private in terms of individual decision making and public in terms of joint corporate decision making. There are are probably prodeath penalty catholics who go to catholic churches and don't spend a lot of time exercised about the fact that their church has a long tradition of opposing the death penalty. There is also a tension between an individual and a denomination. I would like back to the civil rights movement and say 40 years ago or 50 years ago my prediction is sessionser was one of the mosted a sew he kate civil rights leaders in the country and went to selma, alabama. That was controversial at the time. A large public church like ours needs to be in the leadership role and needs to take stands that may be controversial. For us this is seen as a fairly consentual decision for those of us in the episcopal church. 
>> Shannon: Have you gotten much reaction so far? 
>> Most of the reaction has been positive. I mean we have gotten angry reaction. I think the churches have been dealing with this question for so long and for me again it is a question about what tools do we offer faithful gay and lesbian people for the living of their lives and if we believe that marriage is a good thing for heterosexual people it seems that marriage is also a good thing for homosexual people because it calls people in a more deeply faithful living of their lives. 

[01:32:29]


>> Shannon: We appreciate your time coming in and eastbound plaining your position here. 
>> Thank you. 
>> Thank you. 
>> A pleasure to be here. 
>> Shannon: We are continuing our conversation with the other side here. John eastman from the national organization for marriage. John, your reaction to what dean hall had to say, the fact that you want to encourage people to live out their faith and be inclusive? 
>> What is interesting is the echurch he is right has gone through a 20 year process of discernment and embraced homosexuality. Going to eugene robinson and a huge outcry in the church so much so that the membership numbers are down 16% over the last decade. A thumb of local congregations have broken off and aligned themselves with other more traditional branches of the international communion. What the dean doesn't say is the step that the church has taken of the national church in the united states is directly in violation of international angloican law and the book of prayer. They can do this if they want but redefining marriage to be something it was never understood to be is going to have dramatic consequences both in this country and in their church. 
>> Shannon: Some people do split although the most recent polling shows that americans are still split on the issue when it comes to gay and lesbian marriage. Very much sort of a 50/50 with a slight advantage to those who favor gay marriage here in this country. For some the dividing line is about a civil ceremony versus what happens in a church. Should churches be able to decide which kinds of couples they will marry? 
>> Well, y know, churches can do whatever they want. The question is what does their religious faith teach. And the folks that are pushing this in the episcopal church have the same kind of living constitution cavalier regard for doctrines of the bible as the living constitution has had with the constitution. The fact of the matter is they should recognize even their own doctrine coming out of the international and international organization says this is not proper. And not in accord with the doctrine of the church. But I think there is another aspect of this. What does this indicate for the legal battle we are in the middle of and I think it shows that different organizations are going to go different ways on this and I think that means that the courts do not need to impose a one rule fits all for the country as the court cases are going up to the united states supreme court. 

[01:35:02]


>> Shannon: We do have both the defense of marriage act case and the prop 8 case out of california. What do you think the supreme court will do with either or both of those cases? 
>> We are certainly urging the supreme court to uphold californians to keep traditional marriage as the definition of marriage in their state. I think they will go that way instead of finding a constitutional right that doesn't exist in the constitution. 
>> Shannon: Thanks for the discussion on this very controversial topic. Thank you. 
>> Thank you.

>> Shannon: President obama has rolled out a number of nominees set so take key roles in the second term administration. Our next guest is vowing to hold up one of the nominations and calls another one of them an in your face pick by the president. Senator lindsey graham republican from south carolina and member of the senate armed services committee joins us live. Great to have you here today. 
>> Thanks for having me. Happy new year. 
>> Shannon: A lot of ground to cover. Start with one of your number oics, benghazi. 
>> Where do we stand and what role does that play in how we handle the nominations? 
>> We stand in the dark as a nation. They are making two movies. He deserves applause and praise for going after bin laden. We don't know what the president did for 7 hours during the attack in benghazi. When was he notified. Did he order people to come to their aid and was the order carried out? We don't know who the survivors were. They were interview youd the day after the attack by the fbi and I cia couldn't get the results of the interview because they are worried about compromising the investigation. We are going back to treating terrorism as a crime. We don't know who changed the talking points to take al-qaeda references out of the talking points given susan rice three weeks before the election. We don't know anything. I don't want to hold up but i will until we get to the bottom of benghazi. In case the administration is listening to this program you are not going forward on these nominations until you share with the congress with really happened in benghazi. 

[01:41:35]


>> Shannon: Do you have support across the aisle at all for the proposition? I'm sure there are democrats who would also like answers to that question. 
>> I would be shocked if the democratic party would not at least join in the effort to find out what the president did during the attack, who did change the talking points. Why are we now you back to a pre9/11 model of where the fbi can't talk to the cia. I hope they are interested in that. 
>> Shannon: Have you been given any timeline for the investigations wrapping up? 
>> You have to remember that brennan is also one of the people that we suspect of leaking classified information about the bin laden raid, the underwear bomber and cyber attacks against iran by us and israel. That is the subject of two criminal investigations. I want to know if the potential cia director and the two people doing the investigation worked for eric holder. I want to know the status of the investigation before we move forward on brennan. 
>> Shannon: So no vote until you get the answers. 
>> Call me old fashioned. 
>> Okay, we will. Moving on to chuck hagel. You have said he is an in your face pick. What do you mean? 
>> I can't think of a more in your face selection. You are picking somebody to be secrary of defense that the iranians have applauded. Kelly acotte said she wants a secretary of defense who the iranians fear not applaud. He voted for an amendment to designate the revolutionary guard -- if teleare not a terrorist organization who would be. He refused to seen a letter designating hezbollah as a terrorist organization and voted against sanctioning iran. So yeah, I think it is a hugely controversial pick. 
>> Shannon: Will you wait to hear him out at the hearing? 
>> Absolutely. I can't wait to hear him tell me why he thought the revolutionary guard in iran wasn't a terrorist organization and what kind of signal are you sending to israel and iran if he becomes the secretary of defense. Might have been a good pick in other times but in the times in which we live where iran is marching toward a nuclear weapon for the president of the united states to pick someone who is openly defying the panetta view of defense size and scope. He wants to cut it below. Secretary panetta says we are destroying the defense department if we move forward with sequestration. And you are picking someone that the iranians applaud and israel is under scrutiny and in the cross hairs of history like any other time I have seen and we are about to nominate a person for secretary of defense who tells israel you should negotiate directly with hamas? A group of people who tried to kill israeli children every day by lobbing rockets. Makes no sense to me. 

[01:44:30]


>> Shannon: And you have tough concerns and tough questions about the nominees and others probably coming up as well. I know that you are deferensial to the president in many cases when justices sotomayor and kagan were up for nomination you did vote for them. 
>> I thought they were qualified. 
>> Shannon: When do you draw the line? 
>> When the signal you are sending to the secretary of defense nominee to the iranians that we are not really serious about stopping your nuclear program and to our allies in israel. He has taken votes that make him the most antagonistic senator in the u.S. Senator maybe he has a good explanation for this. I draw the line when I think it will compromise our international security interests. 
>> We will continue our conversation with senator graham more after this break. A whole lot more to come. diabetes... Your doctor will say get smart about your weight.

[01:47:07]


>> Shannon: Vice president joe wide biden is expected to deliver the task force recommendations to gun control to president obama on tuesday and some are concerned it could include regulations that would infringe on gun owners second amendment rights. We are back now with senator lindsey graham. I want to ask you you, how do you think we are are doing in afghanistan and our plans there. 

[01:49:34]


>> The president's decision to accelerate withdrawal and leave a small force behind is a disaster in the making. Our national interests are not determined by whate leave behind. There is only one afghan brigade that can maneuver itself. So a small force that just does training and counter terrorism how are the afghans going to get around the country without american helicopter and air lift support and if you take the intelligence gathering process out of the mix we go blind and that is a big chance for the enemy to regenerate. This is heart breaking to me. We fought so long and so hard. If we just followed the military commander's advice i think we could end this well. For four times now the president overruled his own commanders instead of having 40,000 surge forces he went with 30. You couldn't go to the east and the south at the same time. Withdrew the surge forces last summer so you didn't have the fighting season. Now, we are is accelerating the troops we have left in afghan for are this fighting season. They don't have helicopters and transport aircraft and if we do what the president is suggesting this place is going to fall apart and the taliban are going to come back and this is what presidt obama said in 2008 as president I will make the fight against al-qaeda and the taliban the top priority that is should be, this this is a war that we have is to wen. Mr. President what you are doing now is I think ensureing that afghanistan will become destable and affect pakistan. The worst signal to send to the iranians and it is heart breaking. 
>> Shannon: The president will say as commander in chief it is his decision. 
>> It is. 
>> Shannon: He s making this decision on his best advice. 
>> He is a good politician and a lousy general. 
>> Shannon: He campaigned on telling the american people that we were going to leave and now he is sticking to what he promised. 
>> In 2008 he campaigned this is the good war we must win and the place we have to get right. He campaigned there s no better SUPtORTER OF THE STATE OF Israel in 2012 than barack obama. Now, here he is picking chuck hagel the most antagonistic senator during his time against the state of israel. He owns iraq and afghanistan. The bush term is finally over. This s his presidency. He left iraq without any troops, al-qaeda is coming back in large numbers and iraq is going to fall apart. And what you see here is the beginning of the reemergences of the taliban in the southern part of afghanistan. We will lose all of the gains we had. Are this is a terrible day for women in afghanistan and the taliban are licking their chops. 

[01:52:05]


>> Shannon: I can only hope in some way that you are wrong about that. 
>> Me, too. 
>> Shannon: And we will see. We talked about the fact that the vice president this week will turn in his recommendations on gun violence. A lot of outcry from gun rights groups saying they were invited as window dressing and they don't feel like all of the issues are being minuted and the vice president used the word executive action that can be taken. What does that mean to you. I don't know what that means but I know that executive order undercutting the constitution is a tough road to go and i would advise the administration not to try to use executive orders to try to change the second amendment and there will be bipartisan opponents. A father transferring a gun to their son, if you want to talk about gun show loopholes we will talk about this but the idea of limiting magazine size. Fox news has done the public a great service. One bullet in the hand of a crazy person is one too many but six bullets in the hands of a woman trying to protect her children from a home invasion may not be enough. She shot the guy five or s times and he still was able to stand. Criminals are going to get the high capacity magazines. We are not addressing the problems. The problem is the school was unguarded. If you had somebody in the school to confront the guy that is a much better solution than trying to limit magazines. 
>> Shannon: We asked twitter users to send over questionu. What has the obama administration and the president in particular done that you do agree with? 
>> Maybe immigration reform? I think the president's surge even though it wasn't 40, 30 was the right thing to do initially. I think he -- him taking off containing a nuclear armed iran was the right decision to make. I hope I can work with them on immigration. I hope we can do some things on entitlement reform. But cw means chief warrant officer. The one thing I cannot tell the chief warrant officer that he has handled iraq anding a well. He hasn't listened to his generals. He played poll tips with troop numbers. At the end of the day if we don't get afghanistan right it will haunt us for decades and if the taliban come back they will kill the people that helped us and nobody in the future will side with us because we will be an unreliable ally. If the taliban come back after 12 years of us fighting them then every other islamic radical terrorist group in the world will be on steroids. 

[01:54:40]


>> Shannon: I love freedom is the name of the next question we got. How far are you willing to go to pursue the truth of the benghazi massacre because the administration will eventually make you a target? 
>> I'm not worried about me. I'm asking the basic facts to be exposed to the american people. Why was it a death trap. Did the president know about the attacks in april and june on the consulate and know about the british ambassador being attacked in june. He said he ordered people to come to the aid of the people at the consulate during a 7 hour attack. When did he maket order and what was the response? If the talking points were changed and al-qaeda was taken out, why? I'm very suspicious that the story that susan rice told was a political story three weeks before the election where she said al-qaeda was decimated. That is hot true. She said the consulate was significantly and substantially secured. Now, we know it was a death trap. I want to know why the cia and the fbi couldn't talk to each other about survivor interviews held by the fbi to make sure we wouldn't have made a mistake that it was based on a video. The questions I'm asking are reason and and I'm going to insist on an answer. 
>> Shannon: And we will be watching along with you as our viewers and americans across the country want the same answers. Great to have you visit with us. Thank you so much. 
>> Shannon: Small business other thans slightly more optimistic in 2012. The index rose half a point to 88. Still one of the lowest ratings in the history. 648 businesses surveyed ranked taxes regulations and poor sales as the top three business problems and 70% say right now is a bad time for them to think about expanding.

It's just you?! Where is everybody?! They said they wanted to come, but they couldn't because... they didn't wantto come. Where were you?! This was a really big deal for me. I got a Master's in Archeology from Georgetown! You didn't even go to school there. Yeah, you transferred all your credits from a fake school in Nairobi where you're also the dean, and his arch nemesis, fraternity prankster, Machmud Thikbooti. So? So you don't really have a degree in archeology. You're a fraud. How can you say that to someone the world has recognized in so many ways? I have an Oscar! That's Cuba Gooding's Oscar. You just bought it on eBay. Nuh-uh. I bought it, andleft feedback. Not enough people do. What Stan's saying is that an Oscar, like a degree, is an achievement people work really hard for. Mr. Gooding was awarded that for his excellence in acting. Sure, he made some bad choices after the film Show Me the Money, but that Oscar is his and not yours. And nothing you do in your miserable life will evercome close to what he did. (Klaus panting) I heard shouting. Is everything okay? There! Are you happy now?! (sobbing) Did you have to be so haron him? He wasnding to be the recipient of the highest honor awarded in the world of acting. I know, but it's just... It's just what, Francine? He was making out like he won an Oscar. You're right. It's an Oscar, for God's sake. (sniffling) Why doesn't anyone like my awards? Well, sweetheart, because you didn't earn them. Like this one. You're supposed to get this for being good at bowling. Are you good at bowling? Bowling's gross. So this is just a hunk of plastic. All this stuff is. I'm sorry, Roger, but you're taking praise for things you haven't earned. But I could earn things. I could work hd if I wanted. I know. You've got great stuff in there. You just have to apply yourself. You believe in me! 

[00:04:01]


(musical trilling) Oh, my God, you can do that? Yeah, when I'm really happy. (musical trilling) Ew! Yeah, it's made out of pee-pee. (crickets chirring) Hey, Dad. Hmm. So, Dad, Mr. Brink gave us an assignment. We're supposed to interview our dads. It's-it's supposed to show us that history can come from anywhere. What? I'm just supposed to ask some background questions, you know... (laughs) about your life. Like, where were you born? That's getting awfully personal. What?! But-but how am I gonna do my assignment? Maybe you don't do this one. It's high school, Steve. doesn't matter. You said that about middle school. When's it start to matter? Never. Never. (music plays on TV) Check it out, guys. I'm training for the Langley Falls marathon. Whoa, that's a big deal, running a marathon. You're not running any marathon. Am, too! Francine explained how when you work for something, it's more valuable. If I finish this marathon, I earna medal. You're a fatso, and you couldn't run four blocks. Stan... What? It's true. His legs are shorter than his feet. Ugh! Roger, don't listen to him. Let your actions speak for themselves. Like when you get drunk tonight and eat all the fruit leather which you claim to hate. I do hate it! Where is it? Not for you. You're in training. And I'm gonna help you. 
???    Welcome to the limit     Limit    Take it maybe one step more     The power game's still playing     So you better w it...    ??????
(sighs) I'm gonna fail this assignment 'cause my dad won't open up. 

[00:06:02]


I'm gonna fail 'cause my dad went to Home Depot five years ago and never came back. Look, Steve, a lot of people feel more comfortable talking about personal things when it's not face-to-face. Maybe you should try calling your dad. I guess it's worth a shot. (phone ringing) Hello? Steve: Hey, Dad. What-what you up to? Eating lunch. I just needed a break from work, you know? Lately, I've been thinking about all the people I've had to kill. God. The first five, ten times you take a life, it's eerie. You remember every detail. I can see all their faces. One had a beard. Each time I pulled the trigger, I tied a little knot in my memory that no amount of whiskey could loosen. 'Course eventually, I stopped caring. Now I can put a bullet through a man's head while figuring out how much KFC to pick up on my way home. It's usually no more than a bucket. The sick part is, I've come to love it-- snuffing out lives. I crave it. I feel like an angel of death. The Messenger of Eternal Darkness. A merciless demon with an unquenchable... Oh, they just put more orange chicken in the buffet. Got to run. (dial tone) Remember, the goal is to finish. Ha! I'm gonna win this thing. Everybody looks so slow! MAN (over loudspeaker): On your marks. Get set. (starting gun fires) (Roger yells, then grunts) (sighs) Oh, my God! Are you okay? I turned my ankle... but I can run it off. (yelling) Roger! Stop! You're hurt. Why'd this happen to me?! I actually tried this time! (sobbing) Oh, honey. Is there anything I can do to make you feel better? You know, I was gonna give you this after the race, but here. (gasps) What's this for? You won a Franny! 

[00:08:03]


It's because you worked really hard, and that's all that matters. Wow. I love it. Hey, could you pull over for a sec? (brakes squeak) (crowd cheering and shouting) I did it! Oh, my God, what a gorgeous trophy! And flowers? Wait, I can't hold everything. I'm gonna have my friend hold my cone. (cheering and shouting continue) bucket table, everybody knows it's about to get real up in here. If you don't show up with kfc at my couchgate, you're not showing up. You're showing down.

most inside. [ annoyed ] I'M PURE MILK CHOCOLATE ON THE Inside. And I love that about you. And here I thought you loved me for my brain. Is that made of chocolate too?!!! 
??????   ??????
You did it! Yay! We love you, Roger! Your butt looks so great in those shorts! I could never get away with those, not since the baby! You didn't win the marathon. Are you sure? 'Cause everyone else thinks I did. What do youthink? I think my trophy is a cooz magnet, and this photo won't scare off any wang, either. I don't know why you did this. You worked so hard to get ready. I mean, you weren't gonna win, but you would have finished. That would have been a realachievement. Actually, I wouldn't have finished. You see, I never went running after breakfast. What? Then what were you doing? Roger: Well, I'd start with one of Francine's gigantic breakfasts. And then I'd leave the house and jog to the corner. There, I'd have a cigarette, two if I ran into that looker Rhonda with the natural low hangers . Then I'd head down the street to where that house is getting a second floor, pop into one of the Porta Potties for the constructions workers, and try to pass my enormous breakfast. That was always a struggle. (Roger chuckles) My only real exercise of the day. And I'd usually fall asleep on the pot. Those crappers heat up big time in the sun, so when I woke up a couple hours later, I'd be drenched in sweat. Half the time, I pooed in my sleep. I can't believe I wasted all that effort on you for nothing. Well, I did win the marathon, so... You didn't win the marathon! You keep saying that. But my new Mazda Miata says otherwise. Oh! (whispering): So sleek. Roger, I'm done with you. No more praise, no more support. You don't deserve it. In fact, I'm taking back my Franny. (gasps) How could you...? What... I worked for that. No, you didn't. But I want it! What are you gonna do with it? I don't know. Maybe I'll give it to Steve. 

[00:12:08]


Steve? You hate Steve. You always say you hate him. I never said that. Then why is it tattooed on your butt? Oh, that's ridiculous. He's just lashing out because I took his Franny back. Nope, it's right here on her butt. I... hate... Steve. (laughs) He-he's just joshing, right, Ma? Ugh! Look! There's nothing there! Oh, God, Mom! Ha-ha, you B.A.'d your son! Uh... the bus is here? Get out of here, Snot! Franny, let's go. I need you to take a picture of me and the Miata for my trophy case. I told you I was done, Roger. Oh, we're really doing this, huh? Fine. I don't need you in my life! I don't need Francine or her stupid award. I'll take my own celebratory picture. (beep) (camera shutter clicks) Ugh! (beep) Oh, what the...! (click) (beep) (camera shutter clicking) (singsongy): Hey. Knock, knock. Here's the guy who maybe needs his friend more than he admitted. What happened to you? A guy punched me in my face, but that probably makes you happy because you hate me so much. I don't hate you. I'm just done investing my time in you. I'm done being the sucker, Roger. You're lazy and a cheat, and I'm done. No, I need you! I'm-I'm sorry. Look, I-I won't be lazy. I'll do something real. I promise. Your word is as worthless as your diploma. Is that what this is about? The diploma? Well, what if I go earn it? What if I become the best damn archaeologist 

[00:14:09]


this town's ever seen? Then you'll have to give me my Franny back! Sounds great, Roger. Knock yourself out. You'll see! Hey, is that my underwear in there? I told you never to wash my underwear! Great, now I got to start all over again! (farting repeatedly) I can't turn this in. It's all about my dad killing people! Call your dad again and get him to talk about something else. (phone rings) Hello? H-Hey, Dad. Son, glad you called. I was kind of bumming, thinking about your mom. What? Why? (groans) I feel our lovemaking has lost all its intimacy. We're not attuned to each other's love energies. We're just slamming away. Dad! I-I'm here with the guys on speakerphone. Hey, guys. Yeah, lovemaking sure can turn into sex without you even noticing it. And why not? Sex with your mom feels great. It's easy to think maybe that islove. And then there's the performer in me always trying to get your mom turned on. I pull her hair, choke her lightly-- or not so lightly... Dad, when you were my age, what was the cost of a loaf of bread? The focus becomes how hot she gets, how many times I can make her shudder with pleasure... All right, this is enough. Dad, what do Mom's boobs look like? I'll tell you, Snot-- they're perfect. Creamy twins with faint blue veins running over them like cooling streams I can wash my face in. (objects clattering) It's 5:00 in the morning. What are you doing? Why, I'm getting ready to go to the dig site. Come on, Roger, what are you really doing? Well... why don't I show you. (loudly): Two millions years ago a glacier cut through this valley. The river used to flow east to west. That's why I knew we had to start south, where an ancient tribe would have a fresh water source. (loudly): How do you know all this? Well, hell, Francine... (quietly): I'm an archaeologist. Why do you keep leaning in when I say stuff? 

[00:16:12]


(laughs): Roger! This is... amazing! Yeah, well, not soamazing. We haven't turned up anything yet. You... you did all this? Well, me and Jabari. Jabari, show Francine how you wear your shirt sometimes. That's how he wears it sometimes. Hello! What do we have here? What is it? If this is what I think it is, I should be able to do this. (playing melody) Wow, Roger, you really found something... Waah! Look out, boss! (crackling) (both screaming) (screaming continues) (gasping breaths) Oh, my God! Roger! I think you've found a lost tribe! Ednolb riah. Hmm, they're speaking Sadrawkcab, the language of an indigenous tribe that lived in these mountains thousands of years ago. Roger, all your hard work has paid off! You've made one of the greatest discoveries of all time! Stel Y-trap! Stel Y-trap! Los like they want to welcome us with a traditional celebration. I am so proud of you. You finally did something real! (chuckles): Well, she bought it. Hey, don't break character. Hey, I saw you on CSIlast week. Oh, yeah? You ruined the episode. are great.

(laughs): Well, good thing you're gonna give me my Franny back instead, huh? (chuckles): Well, I should say so. (primitive music playing) Hey, looks like something's about to happen. 
???   ??????
(clap) I think he wants us to join them. No, I'm pretty sure they only want me down there. Oh, boy, I hope I don't embarrass myself. Who knows if I can even keep up? Two, three, four. (orchestra playing lively Broadway-like intro) 
???   ??????
Sit down, Franny. This isn't about you. 
???   ??????
Big finish, guys. Bring it home. (song ends) Host this,Doogie Howser. All right, whew. Let's head home. What? No. We need to stay and study these people. This is all so fascinating. Oh, (bleep). ...and that's why my dad didn't go to his dad's funeral and why I won't go to my dad's funeral. Steve, you're up. Yeah. Uh, see... m-my dad wasn't really willing to answer the questions. Sounds like a whole lot of nonsense, Steve. You know what I think? I think you're just trying to get out of this assignment. 

[00:23:01]


Oh, is that what you think? Okay, Mr. Brink, here we go. (line rings) Hello? Hey, Dad. I'm calling from my history class. So, who was president when you were a kid? Oh, I don't know, I guess I think about killing myself pretty frequently. And why not? What's so great about living? You know when I'm happy? For about five seconds in the morning when I first wake up, before I remember who I am and what my life is all about-- (voice breaks): anxiety, disappointment... diarrhea more often than not. (sighs) I don't... I don't know if there's an afterlife, but who cares? Nothingness couldn't be any worse than this meaningless march through my empty days. (beep) See, Mr. Brink? Mr. Brink? He's right-- it's pointless. Life dismissed. (loud thud) This was supposed to last three hours. We only rehearsed the dance number and the feast. We're out of material. Hey, you guys all had improv on your r??sum??s. (loudly and slowly): Is this your drinking water? Um... goo-goo gah-gah? Look, people want to home. They have families. I know Hannah's son has a fever. It's bad. He's throwing up right now at home with a 14-year-old babysitter. Aw, geez, Hannah, why... why don't you just leave? Because I drove with Gary. So Gary can go, too. Screw it, take Gary. Gary doesn't want to leave. (moaning) I-I don't know what to tell you, Hannah. All right, all right, how about this? I'll do something that makes the tribe mad, and you guys chase us out of here. Staying was a really cool idea, Francine. I've learned so much. Like, for instance, they're a tchotchke-based culture. They think these things hold the spirits of their ancestors. Oh, God! Oh, no! Oh, if this thing breaks, there's gonna be trouble. 

[00:25:05]


Teg meht! Run! (angry shouting) (screaming) Shoot. Must have taken a wrong turn. (shouting stops) Um... Um... this way! (angry shouting) We're gonna make it! (screams) No! (weak groan) No way. (gasps, indistinct chatter) Oh, my God! What's going on? We're actors! You just killed Cuba Gooding Jr. Show me... the heaven. (groans) Roger, what the hell is going on? Fine. I staged everything, okay? This isn't a tribe; these are all actors and actresses. Actually, we prefer to be called "actors" now, as well. Shut up, Hannah! So this was all a setup? But... how? How did you do all this? Well, it started with the casting. Ryan Creamwell. I'm with Preferred Artists. Take off your shirt and throw it to me. (sniffs) It's disgusting. You got the part. Then it was on to the choreography. No, no, no, no! Eyes on me! One and two and kick and tush and kick and bush and finger, finger, finger, finger, finger. And then I had to find my young boy assistant. But whydid you do all this? Because I wanted my Franny back! So what Ithink means that much to you? Yeah, but now you just think I'm a big, lazy faker again. Lazy? Roger, I've never seen anyone work so hard on anything in my entire life. You mean... I impressed you? And how! I wish Stan was here to see this. Hey, where's my Oscar? (quiet organ music playing) This belongs to you.

Well, thank you very much. This is the first time we played this show, and it's really an honor and a pleasure to be part of this stage and having you guys here. Thank you very much, and I hope you really enjoy the rest of the show here tonight. Normally, this thing is just a duo, which is Gabriela and myself. But last year we wanted to do a different kind of project and we decided to take nine tracks from the first two studio albums we have and went to C.U.B.A. with the amazing Alex Wilson here on keyboards. [Applause] You know, we were working some different arrangements with songs, and we came up with an album called "Area 52." And it was supposed to take a year from touring, because we tour a lot and we wanted to have a break and then work on the next album, but when the album came out, we really liked it, and we thought it was a great opportunity for us to go out with these amazing musicians. So this is what we're doing here. [Cheering]

were Mexico, and at that time, we planned to play metal music. We loved all the usual suspects, which, Pantera, Metallica, Megadeth, Testament. So we did our own music, influenced by these bands, and we wantee famous and recognized, and we spent so much time trying to promote ourselves. And then, eventually, we said, no, we are not getting anywhere. We're super super unsuccessful. So we decided to quit the band and start to play with acoustic guitars. And then we decided to go to Europe first, without knowing anybody there. And we started to write some sort of melodies and started to develop this crazy style playing, you know. And then we are here. Yeah. Skip like 10 years. [Laughter] music television celebrates its 38th season.

>> Production funding and educational outreach for Biz Kidsis provided by a coalition of America's Credit Unions, where people are worth more than money. A complete list of individual credit union funders is available at WXXI.org. 
>> Every day, America's Credit Unions help members with their financial needs and with programs like Invest in America. It's only fitting that credit unions support Biz Kidsbecause financial education is what we do. Learn more at lovemycreditunion.org. 
>> Paging Dr. Bender... 
>> Well, Doc, what is it? A boy or a girl? 
>> Well, the Persona-scan 3000 is a state-of-the-art 3D-imaging device, so not only can it tell the gender of your child but also your baby's money personality. You see there are multiple kinds of money personalities. There's the penny-wise, pound-foolish type, or PWPF, and then you've got your oblivious type who doesn't even really think about money. And then there's... huh, that's interesting. 
>> Wh... what is it? Is my baby okay? 
>> Well, you see the swollen cranium? That means your child likely has an active imagination. And right there, the twitching fingers. That means your baby probably has a compulsory need for material possessions. And right there, see that? That sir, is a $10,000 watch. Congratulations, you two are going to be the proud parents of a money star. You best start saving now, 'cause these kids tend to rack up huge debts. And... 
>> (sobbing) 
>> What's wrong? 
>> We were hoping for a Biz Kid. 
>> ?????? Whoo-hoo-hoo! 
>> ?????? When making money is the aim ?????? These kids they bring their game. ?????? They're the Biz Kids! 
>> Can you dig it? 
>> ?????? They know what's up, they let you know ?????? just how to make that dough. ?????? They're the Biz Kids. 
>> Right on! 
>> ?????? So learn a little more about bringing money through the ?????? door. ?????? They're the Biz Kids! 

[00:02:06]


>> Right on! ?????? 
>> Brought to you by: Your money personality. Define it before it defines you. 
>> Shh. I'm running a little experiment. I'm trying to see what I can find out about people's money personalities based on how they handle... candy. Let's take a look. Ah, oblivious. Oblivious doesn't know how much is going in or how much is coming out. The same is true for both candy and money. They don't pay attention to how much they're making or how much they're spending. They're oblivious. 
>> Where are the European chocolates? 
>> The money star personality is all about the bling-bling of what they have. You know who they are. They need to have the brand names, they worship money, and they overspend to make it look like they have it. 
>> I only eat the most expensive candy. 
>> Huh? Candy! 
>> More candy? 
>> Maybe you know someone who's penny-wise and pound-foolish. We like to call that PWPF. They try very hard to save a whole bunch of money up front, but in the long run actually spend more. 
>> I have tons of these at home that I bought on sale at the Overstock Discount Warehouse of Value place. They were cheap, because they were beyond the past due expiration date. Now I'm sick of 'em. And they're getting kind of moldy. 
>> The PWPF either saves too much or cuts costs to the point of having a lot of expenses in the long run. You see, they spend a lot of money in order to save a little money. So there you have it. Oblivious, PWPF, and money star. All these three personalities are inside all of us to one degree or another, the trick is not to let any single personality take over. You gotta find out which personality is most like yours, break some bad habits, and hopefully you'll become the best kind of money personality-- the Biz Kid. Don't you want some candy? 
>> No, thanks. I had some earlier. 
>> The way someone handles their money says a lot about their money personality. 
(whistling) 

[00:04:06]


>> Hi, I'm Valerie. I used to make impulse purchases without knowing if I could really afford them. 
>> Gucci. 
>> Prada. 
>> And Versace. 
>> I bought this online because I had to have it. Never worn it. I bought this hat because I just thought I needed it. Never worn it. I bought these shoes for $100. Never worn 'em. 
>> I had made a lot of money through working, and I had no idea where I'd spent any of this money. I had nothing to show for where this money had gone. 
>> That is pretty. I love that. 
>> Look at this one. 
>> If I'm out shopping with my friends, it's a lot easier for me to make impulse purchases because I'm caught up in the moment and I'm not really tracking where my finances are going. It's a lot easier to spend on a debit or credit card because you can't see exactly how fast your money is going. When I started working at Forever 21 and got my first paycheck, I knew that I needed to have a better handle on my finances because I know that I had worked hard for that money. That's when I became a Biz Kid. I started to use a ledger in order to track my finances and I started checking my online banking statements more regularly. Pay attention to what you earn and what you spend, Biz Kid. I started a blog called "Beauty and the Budget" back in May of 2009. You can find a wide variety of content on frugal living, like how to manage your finances or where to find the latest fashions for under $50. I'm really driven to do "Beauty and the Budget" because I want to show that fashion can be affordable without having to worry about buyer's remorse or maxing out credit cards. 
>> Hi, I'm Dorothy, and my friends and I need your help. 
>> My help? I, the Great and Powerful? 
>> Yes, you see this old witch told me I couldn't go home to Kansas unless I help the three worst money personalities in all of Oz change their bad spending habits. 
>> I see. Tell me, each of you, your attitudes towards money. 

[00:06:07]


>> Well, I don't have a brain, so I don't really think about money. I just buy whatever I want and hopefully I have enough to pay for everything. 
>> What about when you don't have enough to cover everything? I see. Clearly you're oblivious. What about you, Lion? 
>> Well, uh, being king of the jungle, I need to have nice things. I don't care how much money I have, just so long as I can keep spending. Look it, I got gators, I got fancy chains, and the munchk ladies just love the bling. 
>> You act like a star. But your habits belie a deep lack of self-esteem. 
>> Well, when you mention it... 
>> Silence! Tin Man, speak! 
>> Well, I don't have a heart. So sometimes I worry that I don't have lots of other things, either. Then I make bad decisions with my money. Normally I'm good with my savings, but then I'll turn around and blow it on bulk deals or buy things that I'll never be able to use. 
>> So, you're penny-wise, pound-foolish. 
>> Why, no. I'm a tin man. 
>> Moo! 
>> Cash Cow here. So, what's your money personality? Are you oblivious? Many cows are, but to be oblivious means you'll never save any hay. Moo! 
>> Have you ever known someone who's oblivious about money? 
>> That's their money 
personality: oblivious. 
>> They're oblivious to what they have in the bank. 
>> Lookie here, it says I got $200 in my bank account. 
>> This is your phone bill, not your bank statement. 
>> Oblivious about what they spend. 
>> Oblivious to the rules of good credit. 
>> They never pay attention to their finances and they never keep records. 
>> An oblivious person will often make spur-of-the-moment impulse purchases, without knowing if they can actually afford them. 
>> They just hope everything will work out okay, somehow. 

[00:08:10]


>> The good part about being oblivious is you don't worry so much. 
>> The bad part? Bounced checks, over the ATM limit, never having money. 
>> Or borrow it and forget to pay it back. 
>> Taking responsibility for one's finances can be scary for the oblivious person, but it's really not hard to keep track of how much you earn and how much you spend. Hey, where's that $10 you owe me? 
>> Um, er, uh... I thought I had it. 
>> To be financially oblivious is to be ridiculous. 
>> Ridiculous. 
>> That guy. 
(kids screaming) 
>> Ice cream! 
>> I'm Mik Bushinski and I'm the owner of Mik Mart Ice Cream. I'm selling ice cream so I can make money to live off of for the next two years while I play junior hockey, and for college after that. I really love to play hockey. Keep track of your money and you'll never mizs your goal. Those. Thank you. And I'll use all these. Thanks, Mom. The whole family sells ice cream novelties, about 70 products in each ice cream truck. Me, my brother, my sisters, my dad and my mom. We kept track of money when I first started the business, but we didn't keep track of where all the money went that wasn't related to the business. At the beginning, it was difficult to track the money because everyone likes using money when it's around. It's always nice to have some, just, "Oh, I need this" or "I need that." I use the money I took from the money box for new skates, new hockey gear, go get food, going to movies, sports gear for me and my brother, buy stuff that I want. And when people started taking, you don't always mark it down, then you don't know really where it is. There was a point where we went to the cashbox to get money to buy our order of ice cream and... how do I put this? There wasn't very much money left in the ice cream box, so we couldn't offer all the products that we pride ourselves in offering. You can take the rest of those. But I'm actually sold out of that one. The truck had a lot of sold out signs on it and it's a little embarrassing when people start asking, "Where's all the options?" I really love to play hockey. "Where's all the options?" New skates. "Where's all the options?" Oh, I need this. "Where's all the options?" I need that. "Where's all the options?" Stuff that I want. Being oblivious is like skating on thin ice. 

[00:10:37]


(buzzer sounds) No, I have not made this mistake again, and I hopto not make it in the future. Thank you. 
>> Can I get a hot fudge? 
>> I keep very strict books that track every penny of the money, where it goes, what comes in, what we spend it on, and what's paid out or what's used. I find that when you keep track of it, you spend it more wisely. It's important to track the money coming in and going out, otherwise you're oblivious. Don't be oblivious, be a Biz Kid. 
>> Biz Kid. 
>> Hello, my name's Oblivious. Yeah, that's my name. O-b-l... 
(Monday Night Football theme) 
>> Welcome to the 21st annual Extreme Money Games. The sun is shining on our track and field athletes today. 
>> It is a great day we've got out here, Mike. And look at these athletes all preparing down on the field right now for our 200-meter dash. 
>> Absolutely, Jim, and I believe favored to win today is Bolt Getaclue from the U.S. of A. 
>> Well, he looks very promising, Mike. In fact, I think that he might even be able to pull off a win in the event today. Now wait just one minute, would you take a look at his track shoes? 
>> It looks like he has two left shoes on. He obviously did not try the shoes on when he made the purchase. He... he is completely oblivious and we can't warn him now. 
>> Runner's ready? 
(starter gun) 
>> And they're off. 
>> What a spin out! 
>> Being oblivious has really cost Bolt the race once again. 
>> Not being more mindful of his purchase has really cost this money athlete his 200-meter dash. You might call it a Nightmare on Spin Street. 
>> Well, you can say that again, Mike. 
>> (slowed down): Nightmare on Spin Street. Stay tuned because women's tennis singles... 
>> Hey, Capitalist Peg here. What's your money personality? Are you oblivious, are you penny-wise, pound-foolish, or are you the money star? 
>> I need another raise because I need to dress nice. I got a hot date and I want her to think I'm all that. Please, please, please! 

[00:12:41]


>> Ba-rian, quit trying to be a money star. 
>> But she'll never go out with me unless she thinks I'm boss. 
>> I'm the boss, and I'm telling you, you gotta live within your means. 
>> Means? Means? What do you mean by means? 
>> You're overdrawn, money star. 
>> Ugh... 
(cheering) 
>> Do you know someone who has the money star personality? 
>> A money star is someone who thinks the things they have make them a better person. 
>> It's almost like they worship money and the illusion of happiness that it brings. 
>> The problem is they overspend to try to live that fantasy life. 
>> Instead of living in real life. 
>> And the debt a money star can rack up is very real and very dangerous. 
>> It can ruin your finances and credit early in your life trying to live like a money star. 
>> And really, who wants to be friends with people who only like you for what you have? 
>> Now, there's nothing wrong with wanting to look good, but you have to live within your means. 
>> Where's all the paparazzi? 
>> Now he's living the money star dream. 
>> What a nightmare. 
>> Money star. 
>> Hi, my name is Joey Mar. 
>> Money star. 
>> I like shoes. 
>> My name is Kylie Staples and I like shoes even more. 
>> Money, money, money star. 
>> We are Glow Mo, that's our business, and what we do is we buy limited shoes, or shoes that just came out, and we resell them. Money star. 
>> In my personal collection, I have about 70 pairs of shoes. 
>> I have about 50 or 60. One of my favorites... these are the Carmine Sixes. I was willing to pay like $280 just to get this one. 
>> These ones are probably $450, 500. I really don't know why they're worth that much. 
>> This is my favorite Jordan ever. This is like my dream shoe. Comes in pink. They're special. I'll have 'em, some day. It's just all about the sneakers, 'cause that's the only thing that you could tell different from anybody else. I think the target customer is high schoolers and basketball players and money stars. It's really a younger market and a lot of these kids, they're still in school, they don't work. 

[00:14:56]


>> Think of creative ways to maintain a money star lwok. 
>> Don't impulse buy and really think it out before you wanna buy your shoes, so if you know you want to buy a shoe, try to set an amount in your head about how much you're willing to spend. Don't let your money star lifestyle... 
>> ...get you into financial trouble. 
>> And they're off here at Money Downs with a thundering roar. Heading out of the gate, it's Penny-wise, Pound-foolish, Oblivious, and Money Star. And that's Money Star taking the early lead. 
>> Go, Money Star! Go, Money Sta... 
>> Well, here we are courtside for the women's singles tennis event. 
>> Well, you know, Mike, I'm having a hard time making out Ms. Millions. It seems like there's a bright light coming off of her body. 
>> Yes, it is indescribable, Jim. Can I... can I get some sunglasses? Yeah, I just really need... Ah, that's... that's much better Mike. I can tell you now Sabrina Millions has blinded the audience with her expensive accessories. 
>> Yes, look at that splashy couture sequined tennis dress she's wearing. And... who knew you could buy a diamond-studded tennis racket? 
>> I didn't. 
>> Absolutely not. You know, Sabrina has always been known for her showy showmanship but she has really outdone herself this time, Jim. Here comes the serve. Oh! And Sabrina Millions misses. She was blinded by her own bling, Jim. 
>> Well, yes, she was, Mike. Yes, she was. 
>> Well, it is all over. 
>> Sabrina's taste for being a money star ruined her chanceto ever be a tennis star. 
>> And as the horses round the turn, it looks like Money Star and Oblivious have fallen behind. Penny-wise, Pound-foolish pushing hard for the lead. My... 
>> Time for another startling adventure with Fast Buck and his faithful horse, Lucky. 
>> Okay, Lucky, where's Gabby? I sent him into town to pick up supplies. 
>> He should be here soon, Fast Buck-- ho! There he is. 
>> Howdy, Fast Buck. Lemme tell you the deal I got on beans. A hundred cases of beans. 
>> Beans? I hate beans. 
>> But beans is good for you. Yep, be 'em over the fire and they're mighty tasty. 
>> Beans? I can't eat beans. 
>> And I hate beans. 

[00:16:57]


>> Didn't you buy some hay or some oats? 
>> Nope. Just a hundred cases of beans. 
>> (whinnies) 
>> Gabby... 
>> Everyone likes to save money, and nobody wants to pay too much. But there's one money personality that takes these measures to the extreme. 
>> Do you know someone who's penny-wise, pound-foolish-- what we like to call PWPF? 
>> The PWPF goes for the short- term savings, but doesn't realize that they're actually losing money in the long term. 
>> They'll buy something on sale in bulk, like soda or candy bars... 
>> Or toilet paper. 
>> And then end up saving it for years. 
>> The classic PWPF gets sucked into a sale and then ends up overspending to buy, like, five for the price of three. 
>> When they only really need one. 
>> Or the PWPF will buy low quality, because it's cheap, and then spend more to repair the item when it's broken. 
>> Like the kid who buys the cheapest cell phone plan and then always goes over on her minutes. 
>> Hey! Are you talking about me? 
>> Yeah, I'm tired of leaving you messages when you can't pick up my calls. 
>> If you're too focused on short term savings, it can really hurt you in the long run. 
>> But it's no problem that can't be fixed once you're aware of it. 
>> Yeah, just text me. 
>> Texting costs too much, so I didn't get it. 
>> Hey! Hey, look out! 
>> Good deal there on the TP, Pwpf. 
>> Rofl. 
>> Lol. 
>> BRB, I need this. 
>> Hi, I'm the coupon kid and I used to be penny-wise, pound-foolish. I was just buying because shopping is fun. If I had a coupon, I bought the product. I wouldn't prepare, I would just go and if I something that I had a coupon for, I would have bought it. In the beginning I was bringing home bags and bags of stuff. I always thought it was a good deal because I was saving 50 cents or a dollar on the product. First, I was buying things that weren't needed by my family. They were going to waste. 
>> Kathleen! 
>> I was buying too many of a certain product and too little of what we actually needed. 

[00:18:58]


>> Kathleen! 
>> Hey Biz Kids, don't buy things you don't need. This is where the coupon magic happens. I started doing more research online to be a better couponer, to save more for my family. Every week I write down what I'm gonna buy, my coupon amount, and then the total. The key to couponing is to be organized and prepared, and when you're not prepared, you spend more than you should. Hey, Biz Kids, don't buy things you don't need. Let's go find some deals. So here are the free product coupons where you can today... to get free bandages and free candy. 
>> Hey Kathy, you have any coupons for this? This is $1.12. 
>> I have this dollar off coupon, and we can match this with this to get this for 12 cents. The beginning I was only saving 20 or 30 percent on a product, but now I save 90 percent. That's a huge difference. The things I buy for my family now are shampoo, toothpaste, mouthwash, razors, medicine, deodorant, toilet paper, napkins. There's so much to buy, and there's so much you need, and a lot of people don't realize you spend a lot of money on essentials. Hi. 
>> Hi. 
>> Got all of this, starting at $12, and it's all the way down to 93 cents. The advice I would give to kids 
out there: if you don't need a product and you buy it, it's not saving, it's wasting. Coupons are great, but they're useless when you're penny-wise, pound-foolish. 
>> Welcome back to the 21st annual Extreme Money Games, and we are just moments away from the 100-meter men's freestyle swim race. You know, the coaches have done all they can, Jim, and now it's just up to the athletes. 
>> Well, that's right, Mike. These young men have been training for this moment for most of their young lives and I think that... 
>> I'm sorry, Jim, I need to interrupt you there. Look at Mark Miser there in lane six, he seems to be having a problem. 
>> Well there seems to be a problem with his... with his swim trunks. It appears that they're a little bit too large. 
>> Ah, Miser's been known to buy his swim trunks by price and quantity rather than quality. There must have been a sale. 

[00:21:02]


>> Well, the swimmers are on their blocks now, they're ready to go, and they're off! Whoa-ho-ho-ho! 
>> That's an unfortunate turn of events. 
>> But not entirely unexpected, Jim. Buying the cheapest product is not always a smart move. 
>> Well. that's right, Mike. Mark has been known to be penny-wise, pound-foolish in the past, and now he's exposed his money personality to the entire nation, quite literally. 
>> Will someone get that boy some pants? 
>> That fit! 
>> Hey, look at this, girl in the plaid dress. Take a look at all these bananas I bought. They were really cheap. 'Course they're kinda rotten. But what a great deal. Would you like one? 
>> Hey there, Ryan. 
>> Hey, Jason. 
>> Okay, let's do this. 
>> Oh, I guess. 
>> Boy, those are really puny punches. 
>> Sorry, I'm just kind of bummed out. 
>> What's wrong? 
>> I just found out what my money personality is. 
>> Oh yeah? 
>> Yeah, I thought I was a Biz Kid. 
>> A Biz Kid? 
>> Yeah, like I know what I spend and I earn. 
>> But you're not a Biz Kid. 
>> No, it turns out I'm penny-wise, pound-foolish. 
>> Did you say "pound"? 
>> Yeah. 
>> Okay. 
(bell rings) 
>> Welcome to The Personality Game. Today we have three different people with three very different money personalities. Money Star. Penny-wise, Pound-foolish. And Oblivious. 
(crickets chirping) Now, Cheryl needs to pick the one with the most desirable money persality. Let's get right to it. 
>> Money Star, if you were a tree, what kind of tree would you be? 
>> I'd be somethin' expensive, somethin' like Brazilian rosewood, perhaps Chinese teak. 
>> Ooh. Penny-wise, Pound-foolish, same question. 
>> A dogwood. They've got a sale down at... at the garden store. And you could get a whole forest for cheap. But they're not really great for this climate. 
>> Oblivious? 
>> Huh? 
>> Okay, stay with us, Oblivious. 
>> Oblivious? 
>> Huh? 
>> Love that show. You know, I used to be a money star back in the day. Loved the fine suits. Soon I ran into financial difficulties and quickly realized I needed to do a better job balancing spending and savings. Once I did that, I had a plan for a sound financial future. Like this kid. 

[00:23:12]


>> I'm Steven, and what's my money personality? I'm the Biz Kid. I'm the founder of Tattoo ID. We make temporary safety tattoos for children, featuring their child's initials and their parents' phone number. I have a little brother, and he actually wandered off one day when while we were outside. So I thought, "What's a cool way to keep him secure?" So I came up with these tattoos, which keep him safe just in case. When I was younger, I use to just have, like, stacks of cash in my house and I thought I was cool. Eventually my parents talked to me, they told me, you now, you never know when it's going to be a rainy day and you're going to need that cash that you saved up from before. And this really helped me to, you know, lower how much I was spending and really allocate and balance my budget. Personal spending, I don't spend much on myself. You know, I spend it on transportation, school. And other times everything goes towards my business. I didn't know how to balance my budgets. By spending less on myself and more towards my business probably wouldn't have the business where it is today. The advice I have for kids is to learn to balance their budgets, is don't spend too much on yourself, think about the future. Like, save up that money for college, not blow your money on all this stuff that you don't really need. Find the right balance, Biz Kid! 
>> They're coming down to the wire and it's... SeaBizKid! 
>> And final question... 
>> Penny-wise, Pound-foolish, if your friends ditched you at a party, how would you get home? 
>> That... that is a very timely question, because I have all these... these bus coupons, but I think they're about to expire. I got a great deal for 'em, though. 
>> Money Star, what about you? 
>> I'd catch a cab. I never take the bus. 
>> What if you didn't have enough money to take a cab? 
>> I'd throw it on the credit card, baby. 
>> Oblivious? 
>> I thought I had enough money for the bus. 

[00:25:13]


>> So, now it's time for you to choose. 
>> Well, Money Star would be fun until he went bankrupt. Penny-wise, Pound-foolish is a short-term saver who ends up spending more money in the long term. And Oblivious is just, well, oblivious. 
>> Your choice. 
>> I wouldn't pick any of these losers. But I do have some questions for you. 
>> Huh? 
>> And now it's time for another Biz Kids Biz Quiz. The Biz Kid money personality is 
A: Oblivious to what they spend, 
B: Blows cash like a money star, 
C: Saves money to the point of 
obsession, or D: A balance of all the above. If you answered D, now that's thinking like a Biz Kid. And really, who's never been oblivious once and while. I remember this one time... 
>> Oblivious. Money star. Pwpf. Just to name a few. Once you become aware of your moy personality type, you can begin to take some steps to fight your worst habits. Money star, your spending to be cool is running you into a financial black hole. Penny-wise, pound-foolish, come on. There's cheap, and then there's you. And if you don't know which category you fall into, you may just be oblivious. Remember, only when you begin to take control of your money and financial life can you truly become a Biz Kid. 
>> Just balanced my checkbook. 
>> Nice shoes. Was gonna get a pair myself, but they're so trendy. 
>> Yeah, but they match my eyes. What? I'm not allowed to have one little splurge? 
>> How much did they cost? 
>> Oh, I haven't looked at the receipt. But I will once I... what?! 
(cell phone rings) Hello? 
>> Hi, there's this really great deal. 
>> Five for the price of three? Hold them for me. Oh, come on! 
>> Well, I guess more work needs to be done. Remember, it's all about finding the right balance. 
(crashing) 

[00:27:15]


>> And now let's blow everybody a big kiss. 
>> Oblivious. Oblivious. Oblivious. 
>> Boink. Boink. Boink. 
>> Money star. Money star. 
>> Penny-wise. 
>> Money star. 
>> Pound-foolish. Silence! 
>> Boink. 
>> Guys, I'd like to thank you all very much for being part of my candy experiment. 
>> Huh? What? 
>> Boink. 
>> I was trying to find out what kind of money personalities you had. 
>> This was an experiment, and you didn't tell us? 
>> This wont look good. 
>> What does this say about your money personality? 
(crow cawing) 
>> Are you a kid that runs a successful business? 
>> If so, then go to BizKids.com. 
>> We want to hear all about it. Like, are you hiring? 
>> Wait, are you looking for a job? 
>> No, just go to BizKids.com and you could be on the show.

=======================================================

Dad, don'torget monkey brains. Yeah, and we need more unicorn testicles. That's where dreams are born. All right, we'll get those, then head back to the restaurant. I just need fresh kale for the burger of the day-- "If Looks Could Kale." Ha! Hey, Reggie, I didn't know you guys shopped here for your restaurants. What happened, Pepe? And why is your face painted like a cat? I lost my restaurant. We're trying to cheer him up. I'm a kitty. I'm a kitty. You didn't read the review? Three weeks after the Moody Food hatchet job, Pepe's taco joint is a yoga studio. A hot yoga studio. I bet, when it heats up, it smells like taco meat. Like my underwear. The Moody Foody's on a rampage. He nitpicks every little thing, Bob. He said my bread was stale. Well, it is pretty stale, Reggie. That's 'cause I buy day-old bread! Okay. Okay. I've been mapping the Moody Foody's patterns for months. He follows a precise ethnic sequence in restaurants: Asian, European, Latin, American. Like Larry King with his wives. Man, you guys are obsessed with this critic. You should be, too! According to my calculations, you're next. Um... okay, that's fine. For all you know, he's already reviewed you. He's a master of disguise. Yeah, when he reviewed my place, he was dressed like a construction worker. For me, he was an E.R. doctor. Park ranger. But listen, Bob, the guy's got a tell. Before every meal, he wipes his hands with a blue handkerchief. Blue. Watch for that, Bob-- blue. (whimpers) Here you go-- $30. What? No, I didn't ask for these. Nobody asks. You describe it, you buy it. Oh, look. He even got the hanky. TINA: Can you draw me on a horse with a zombie riding behind me? No. 

[00:02:01]


Draw a picture of my dad's mustache really giving it to a caterpillar. No, don't do that. Do it! Do it! Do it! Hold on to these sketches, Bob. They could save your restaurant. Uh, Tran, my restaurant will be fine. After all, Reggie's bread is stale. And, Pepe, your carne asada isn't even beef. Carne asada is beef? And Tran's noodles are... So what? I reuse my noodles. If people don't eat them all, I'm supposed to just waste them? It's just, no offense, fellas, but I use fresh ingredients, so, you know, I should be all right if this critic comes. Offense taken. Here's you on a horse with a zombie. 50 dollars. Dad, pay the man. No, $50-- for that? $50-- it's a little girl, a horse and a zombie. Dad, that's so cheap for what you're getting. Look, if the critic comes, it's just another customer, you know? I know. Just a customer who can shut us down with one bad review-- that's all. I know he can destroy us, Lin. I don't need a pep talk. And if I did, this would be a horrible pep talk. It's him, Dad. It's the Moody Foody. BOB: Gene, that's Mike the Mailman. You've seen him every day for the past five years. It's the long con. It's him. Tina, that's Gene. Long con. Thanks, Mike. Yeah, thanks, "Mike." I cannot hear you. That's got to be the food critic. A Civil War reenactor? Ah, can't stand all that drab gray. No wonder they lost. All right, keep an eye out for the blue handkerchief. ("Dixie" ringtone plays) Hello? You're really sorry? Okay, I'll... I'll come do the battle. For the record, the buttons are authentic. All right, everyone, back to work. We're not going to stand around and wait for a food critic who may or may not ever show up. Dad, Dad, another Civil War reenactor is here. He must be fighting for the North. Bob: It's a Hasidic Jew, Gene. You know that. Blue hanky! Blue hanky! Blue hanky? Blue hanky? Yes, blue hanky! That's the Moody Foody! (gasps) Blue hanky! Blue hanky! Right there-- blue hanky! Aah! Hanky panky! Blue hanky right there!

Cockroach! Gene. Let's bribe him. Dad, take out the lettuce and replace it with this $20 bill. That I took out of your wallet. Oh, or tape it to his back. That's not how a bribe works, Tina. (muffled): Yes, it is! Now, everybody calm down, all right? We just do what we do-- we give him a delicious meal, we get a posive review, and that's that. Yeah, 'cause if we don't, it's curtains. We're done. Lin, stop pep-talking! Wha...? Let's just take a deep breath... (sighs heavily) Not like that. (muffled sigh) (exhales) Where'd Tina go? She's out taking the critic's order. No, no, no. Time for the charm bomb to explode. Hi there, customer. Is someone hungry? That's why I'm here. Are you ready to order Uh, yeah. I just need another second. Are you just going to stand there and stare at me? Uh-huh. Oh, God. (Linda sighing Louise, go get Tina. Shift's over, sweetheart. Let's talk Palestine. Or my order, we could talk about. Oh, God, Lin, go get Louise. All right, all right, all right. (gulping) Shoo, shoo, shoo, shoo. How we... (belches) ...doing today? The food here is so delicious. I'm a customer. Try the pad Thai. Mmm. Okay, everyone, great job. Back in the kitchen. Sorry about all that. 

[00:08:04]


Um, I'd like to recommend the burger of the day-- the "If Looks Could Kale" burger. (chuckling) Uh, you get it? Mm-hmm. Uh, well, you're not laughing. I don't think you got it. "If Looks Could Kale." Yeah, I-I got it. (sighs) I'll have a cheeseburger. Coming right up. (whispering): That guy's creeping me out. Okay, it got a little rocky out there, but we righted the ship. I set it up, you knock it down. Right, Dad? Yeah... right. Thanks, Tina. Smooth sailing. Just like every day. So, well, what kind of burger did he order? Crap. So, I know we discussed having the burger of the day, but I want to you didn't want that. Where did we land, uh, in the end? You seriously don't remember? No, I do. Um... cheeseburger. Just remembered. I just remembered on my own. Cheeseburger! Gene: Got it. Gene: Uh-oh! Oh, God. Gene: Aah! That's just the 3:00 fire. Your burger may take an extra minute. In the meantime, enjoy the show. Gene! Oof. (groaning sigh) Ugh. (groans) "Overdone and dry." It's like, uh, "above and beyond," right? (groans) It's not bad. What about "insufferable"? What's that? Maybe that just means he didn't suffer. That's good news. I've seen some murders in my line of work, but what a hit job. Wait, here's something good. "The best part of the meal was..." "Continued on page 45." "...was the napkin I spat my food into. Thank you, little napkin." Oh. This is my fault. I screwed up the burger. It's my fault. So it's settled. Wait a minute. You screwed up. And you and you. All right, stop the finger-pointing. (sighs) I'm sorry. I... sometimes I forget how horrible you all are at your jobs. You're all horrible! Sorry. I mean, you are horrible, but I shouldn't have said it so loud. All right, okay. That's enough of the papers. But you are! Okay, okay, enough. Stop... How bad could everybody be?! Stop the yelling. Who cares about one bad review? 

[00:10:05]


Don't be such a baby. Come, come, come. This is one of my vacant spaces. It used to be a burger restaurant. Hi, Bob. Hey, Mr. Fish. How are you? Hi, Mrs. Burger. Good. Uh, Mr. Fischoeder, this is still a burger restaurant. Yeah, let us die slowly in peace, you vulture. Right you are. One bad review won't sink the SS Bob,will it? You're like a benign tumor. With a little bit of hair and teeth. I'm like a tumor with teeth? Sounds cute. Yes, little man. It's a compliment. Let's come back in a week. It should be empty by then. Don't worry, Bobby. People can make up their own minds. You'd be surprised. They don't need some critic. As long as we get Michelin-recommended, we'll be fine. Order up. (groaning) What? What? Something wrong with the burger? No, uh, it's fine. It's just... maybe you missed the mark with this one, is all, you know? What? What do you mean, Teddy? I don't know, Bobby. Just tastes a little... overdone and dry or something. Overdone and dry, Teddy? You're just quoting the review. No, I know. It's just, now I have words to put to my tastes. Will you get a mind of your own, Teddy? I mean, seriously-- with your dead eyes! What? My eyes aren't dead. He's not dead. No, I'm fine. And you, Mort. What did I... what did I do? Whatever! (sighs) Lin, this review is going to be the end of us. People think we're terrible now. Not terrible. We're not terrible. Bobby, you know that. Look at me. I know that, but it doesn't matter. We have one crappy day, and then everybody reads about it, and now that's what they think-- forever. MAN: Hey, how about this place? Oh, yeah? Well, your haircut's overdone and dry! And you, your pants are overdone and dry! Look at your dumb face! It's overdone and dry! Get back here, people! Where are you going? I want to review you! Yeah! I'm going to review everyone! You're getting it! Overdone and dry! Overdone and dry! Overdone and dry! Overdone and dry! Overdone and dry! Overdone and dry! Man: At turbotax, we know this is more than a ycheck.

[00:15:30]


"Two thumbs down... my throat." (chuckles) That's just rude. Put it down, Bobby. Just stop. Enough. Attaboy. Good day, sir. Good day, Louise. Actually, you've had better days. That's why we're here. We're the PR firm of Cooper, Molyneux and Juarez. Wait. What happened to Belcher? Recent events have left the name, Belcher, badly tarnished. Tina? Here's Dad's image before the review. Here's Dad's image after the review. Rock bottom. Aw. They made a poster, Bobby. Uh, you guys were there, too-- remember?-- destroying our business. Hey, hey, hey. Um, I'm pretty sure I was in Sausalito that day. I'm pretty sure you weren't, Gene! All right, all right, let's stop blaming and start gaming. Our firm specializes in image rehabilitation. This is our Basic Image Cleaner Package. Lunch is included. GENE: Our Bad Boy Robot Package comes with a boob job. Lunch not included. Your father doesn't need his image cleaned. He's not a celebrity. Dad's a local celebrity. Like Eyebrow Man. Remember before his eyebrows grew out and he was just Parrot Man? I hate that parrot. Hi, parrot. (squawks) Nerd alert! What? No one knows about peles' bad days in other professions. None of these jobs get reviewed by critics. I.T. support? That doesn't get reviewed. Sales analyst, not reviewed. Stop torturing yourself. You know what, take off your cranky pants and go take a nap, all right? Accounts receivable specialist. What's that? Sounds great. I bet that job never gets reviewed. 
??? Bup-bup-bup-bow, bup-bup-bow    Bup-bup- bup-bow-bup-bup-bow!    ??????
(laughs) I love this song. Sam my man from Uzbekistan! You got the Bob in the house! A lot of e-mails. Mostly spam. What is that, ramen? Tea. Oh. I thought it was ramen. No. Tea. Hey, what are we talking about? I thought Kathy was making ramen. For some reason, I saw noodles. 

[00:17:31]


Nope, just tea. Huh. (groaning) (air hissing) (hushed): Hey, it's Jason's birthday. Did you sign the card? (whispers): Not yet. Oh, here. To the J-man. (groans) It's good cake. My wife made it. (a la Borat): My wife! (all laugh) Borat! Hey, do it again! Jeff, get in here! You gotta hear this! My wife! Yes! No! 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 35... Linda, kids, napkin holder, ice cream machine! Oh, come here! Dirty spot on the counter that I can never get out! Get over here! I love you. What the hell is wrong with you? I had a nightmare, Lin. I worked in an office. I had to sign a birthday card. Don't touch me. You're all sweaty. I hate signing birthday cards. You sign ours. Actually, your mother does it for me. Oh. Sorry. Like we read those things. Where's the money? (chuckles) You know, I realized I'm not a cubicle guy. I can't do it. I can't do anything other than this. Yeah, look at you. If this restaurant fails, I'm gonna kill myself. There he is, that's the spirit. Yup. You should ask for a redo. A what? A redo. One time, to get out of a Spanish test, Kelly Mathis forced herself to throw up. I mean, vomite. Hmm. Then another time, to get out of a math test, she forced herself to get her period. That's how she got a redo. A redo! That's genius! We'll get our period! No, a redo. No, period! I'm gonna walk over to the Moody Foody's house and cook him dinner! Wine him, dine him, 59 him, Dad! That's right, Gene! (growls) Thank you, Tina. This time I'm gonna make the Moody Foody a great burger. All right! If you think that's the right move, I trust ya... kinda. Chant me out! Kids: Redo! Redo! Redo! Redo! Let's go watch this train wreck. All: Stalking Dad quietly! Stalking Dad quietly! 

[00:19:38]


Oh, well, well, well, the guy who couldn't remember my order finds my address? How'd you manage that? Well, let's just say some of my fellow disgruntled restauranteurs have been dumpsacking your house. Oh, yes, the flaming bags of poop. But I'm not here to do that, all right? I-I came here to cook you another burger. Oh, well that's so ni... I'd rather be dumpsacked. Listen, I know your Bob's Burgers experience was subpar. I just want a redo. Of course you do. Great! Let's get started then. Where's the kitchen? Ah! What is that?! It's a Taser! Ow! That stings! What is that supposed to do? It's supposed to incapacitate you. I'm gonna send in a bad review. I am... notshocked. Hey! Oh, oh, I'm calling the police! Don't, don't. Wait! I just want to cook you dinner! I just want you to try my burger, okay? Get off me! Just let me cook you a burger! Ow! Ah You're biting me! Ah! Get... Ow! Stop! Dad, we felt we should be here as your PR fir... Oh, yes! This doesn't look like a redo. Tickle fight! Hyah! ...so as you can see, GEICO's customer satisfaction is at 97%. Mmmm tasty. And cut! Very good. People are always asking me how we make these GEICO adverts. So we're taking you behind the scenes. This coffecup, for example, is computer animated. It's not real. GEICO's customer satisfaction is quite real though. This computer-animated coffee tastes dreadful. GEICO. 15 minutes could save you 15 % or more on car insurance. Someone get me a latte will ya, please? are great. Yeah, its the Galaxy Note II. You can do two things at the same time. You can watch videos and text. Or you could watch the earnings report and take notes, like we're supposed to. So... can I get it? Yeah. Okay Either of you put together the earnings report? Yes, me totally. Why don't you tackle the next quarter while we go to lunch. Pu Pu platter? Yup!

And soft juicy chews. Untamed fruit flavor... Jolly rancher. Listen, kids, taping people to chairs is bad, okay? Never do this. We're just helping him calm down so that he can enjoy this burger. Bye-bye, frown! Now it's a smile! There. Comfy? (angry grunting) Good. This is an old classic of mine. It's called the "Girls Just Wanna Have Fennel" burger, huh? God. Was that a nose laugh, huh? Ow! No! Oh. I laughed, Dad. Thanks, Tina. Yeah, me, too! Don't tie us up! Okay, big boy bite. No, nuh-uh, no. Not happening. Uh-huh, uh-huh. Mm-mm. All aboard the burger train! No, I'm not getting on the... Open up the tunnel. Choo-ch-ch-ch... Mm-mm, mm-mm. (doorbell rings) Are you expecting someone? Oh, that must be my next kidnapper. Linda: Bobby, you in there? Lin? What are you all doing here? Linda told us about the redo. 

[00:23:39]


We brought food from our restaurants. I brought no food because that man, he ruined my restaurant. So... how's it going? Uh, not great. He won't eat my burger. What? Well that's just rude. Linda, wait, don't... Bobby... (gasps) you've taken him hostage? (chuckles) No, no. He's in his own home. "Hostage" is a little much. It's not that. No, no, "hostage" sounds about right. Shut up! This is dark, Bob. Real dark. I'll go get the jumper cables out of my car. No, no, no, no, no. This should catch any blood or bodily fluids. No blood, no jumper cables. Yes, jumper cables!

Brought to you by FORD. Go Further. Captioned by Media Access Group at WGBH access.wgbh.org Shh! Hugo: Will the burger be hot enough? Hot enough to kill the deadly bacteria? Or is it so cool that I will shut you down? One sixty-three, one sixty-four... One sixty-five. Hot patty. It's safe. Damn it! Yay! Yay! Grade-A ground beef. Meaning we dropped it on the ground. Louise. Are we done here, Hugo? Almost. there's just the little matter of your handwashing certification. I don't see it prominently displayed anywhere. Come on, nobody needs to be certified in handwashing. Yeah! Hands off my hands, government! If you wish to remain open, you will attend a one day seminar exploring the 32 steps of proper hand sanitation. I'm not taking that seminar. Not before you watch the introductory DVD, you're not. Ugh. Come on, Hugo. And here's your "C" rating. 

[00:02:00]


Which will remain in your window until you graduate. What?! Hugo, you're an awful man. Uh, wrong, Bob. I'm a "lawful" man. (laughs) Falafel man. Waffle man. Omelettes. Am I doing it right? We should get going, Hugo. Who're you going to harass next, guys? Well, Bob, if you must know, perhaps you've heard our towns now home to a ding nude beach? There've been reports of vendors there serving food while n-n... naked. That's how the vendors served food in the Bible. Don't drag religion into this. Sorry. So long, Bob. Get certified or that "C" will stand for "closed." (laughs) Hi. I'm Andre Royo. I played Bubbles on the critically acclaimed series The Wire. Today I'm here to talk about a different kind of bubbles. Soap bubbles. Remember: when washing your hands, do it for the time it takes to count to a thousand. One... two... three... four... (groans) Bobby, when are you and me gonna go to that nude beach that Hugo was talking about? Ugh. Nude beaches are full of overweight, out-of-shape old bodies and I don't want to go there and realize I look exactly like that. I'll go with you, Mom. Mother-daughter nudity day. Fun! I'm pretty sure it's no kids allowed. No kids allowed? Hmm... Look through here and tell me what you see. Tina: It's a cliff. My turn! That's a cliff, all right. Tina, you nailed it! No, it's a cliff that overlooks the nude beach. And if we figure out how to get up there, we could sell tours-- nudity tours-- to teenage boys. It's like the Internet, but outside. Yes! Hey, whoa, God! We're not even at the nude beach yet, you. Guess my boobs didn't get the memo. Ha! Linda: It's like we're in Paris. I love it. I know. C'est la vie. Let's go! Whoo! Keep hacking! Come on, guys, we're gonna be the Lewis and Clark of nudism! I'll be the Sacajawea. Of sacks! This is fun! (gasps) You already took your bottoms off! Whoa, whoa! What kind of shape is that? 

[00:04:01]


I don't know, it started out to be a triangle, but then I had to do it myself, and then, I don't know... it's like a flower or something. Whoa. Check out the hot guys in the drum circle. Hi. Hey, that looks like... Oh, my God! Bobby, you're not gonna believe this. He was at the nude beach! Wait, who was there? Hugo! Yeah, he was trying to shut the place down. No, he's one of them now. One of what? A nudist! Nudie! He wasng in the waves. (chuckles) Dancing around. He looked like, ah... Madonna in the "Cherish" video. Th-that's not possible. He said he took a leave of absence to be nude. So... Hugo's not our health inspector anymore? Do you know what this means? We're free! Ah! Oh, oh! No more surprise inspections! Ha, ha! No more stupid violations! And I am not going to the handwashing class! Filth! I wash my hands.

Hugo the health inspector is a nudist! I know, can you believe it? Gretchen and I spotted him from across the sands... Out with the bad air, in with the nude air. Don't be embarrassed, Linda. Yes, we were once an item, and true, we never saw each other nude back then-- unfortunately-- but better late than never. What happened? I thought you were gonna shut this place down. Oh, my investigation? Let's just say what I uncovered in that investigation was my very own soul. Wow. The old Hugo would have seen this man as a health hazard, pure and simple. The new Hugo sees only a man. A nude man selling blondies. Three blondies, please. Whoa, wai... Wha... Where'd you pull that from? My fanny pack. Where's your fanny pack? Oop. Oh-ho! There it is. Well, it kind of makes sense. I mean, the guy was wound so tight he was like a tubby little time bomb. Teletubby time bomb. Kids! Come in here! I have amazing news. Can't it wait? We're tired. And rashy. (grunts) Where were you? Bushwacking a trail to the nude overlook. Dad, before you say anything, know that we're gonna come out of this deal stinkin' rich! And we're gonna put a roof over you and Ma. 

[00:08:09]


Well, good luck. I'd pay not to have to look at those people. Hey, Dad, whoa, whoa, whoa, rewind. I'd like to hear your amazing news. Everyone, Hugo is not a health inspector anymore. He's a nudist! (door bell jangles) Ron! I think I know why you're here. Go ahead, I'll pretend I haven't heard. It's true. Hugo has taken a leave of absence. We miss him terribly and hope for his speedy return. Ha-ha! Right. All right, well, I'd like you to meet Hugo's replacement. Hey, hello, Tommy Jaronda. Pleasure to meet you. Hi. Uh... what, you're the new Hugo? Well, there's only one Hugo. Yeah, well, I'm here, so let's get into it. Oh, um... listen, Inspector, uh, Jaronda, I know you're just doing your job, but we got inspected two days ago, so... Yeah, yeah, it's cool, Bob. Yeah, yeah, you know what? Call me Tommy. Okay, Tommy. All right. I'm seeing a lot of tickytacky fouls here. What, he made you go to a handwashing seminar? That's some major B.S. Pardon my language, kids. How are you? Hello. No sweat off our ass. Yeah, that Hugo, he kind of had it out for us. Ugh. I-I can't stand inspectors like that. You know? Makes us look like turds. "No one can make you look like a turd without your permission." Eleanor Roosevelt. Ha! This kid's a trip! Funny stuff, funny stuff. You know what? I'm actually, uh... I'm starving. You hungry, Ron-Ton? You mean eat one of Bob's burgers? Hugo would never... Oh, come on, Ron. This guy... (laughs) How tall is this guy? (chuckling): He's pretty tall. The leaning tower of t.. of tall guy. (Bob laughs) I'm giving you a hard time, come here. Hey, Bob, can you grill us up a couple? Um... is this part of the inspection? Uh, yeah, something I like to call the mouth inspection. (laughing) Okay. (continues laughing) Whoa! This is incredible! Wow, first time I ever got a compliment from a health inspector. Bob, question: You like rock? Um, yeah. I like rock... music. Is that what you're talking about? Yes. Okay. You know, I play almost every night over at Pistol McSwish's Basketball and Brew. You should come by. Th-That'd be great. Absolutely. What your burger did to mmouth, my music is gonna do to your ears. (laughs) That's great... (laughs) Come here, come here. All right, all right. Get out of here, man. What are you doing? Yeah, come here. Oh. You got me. What, you punching me? I'm punching you back. I think Dad just got to second base with that guy.

What are you doing this weekend, brother? I would like to visit the nude beach and see the naked people. You only live once, right, my sister? Haven't you heard? Kids aren't allowed on the nude beach. No! Unfair, isn't it? Well, what if I told you that you couldsee the nude beach? Mm! All the dingles... Ooh. All the dongles... Ahh. All for one low price. I want to see the dongles! Hell, yeah! Cocoa-buttered boobies! Sign up here to see the buff from the bluff! Don't be shy... they certainly aren't. Darryl: Hello, Louise. Darryl, you interested? You strike me as more of an indoor nerd. I am interested, but not as a customer... as a key member of your team. For a piece of the action? Oh-ho-ho, is that so? (laughs) It is so. If you're nudie watching from the top of a bluff, I've got something that'll double your money. Basically, this is the Hubble for boobies. I've seen my neighbor across the street put her bra and girdle on hundreds of times. Aren't girdles for old people? They are. And she is. Nice. (panting, grunting with effort) (groans) How come we're doing all the lugging? You're also doing all the yapping. Tina: Nudes, ho! Starting tomorrow, we're gonna be flush with ass-cash. Whatcha doin', Pops? Hitting the streets for some hooch? No, he's off to Pistol McSwish's to see the new health inspector play his rock. I have to go. We want to keep this guy on our side. Tommy! I was just heading out to catch your set... Bob! You're never gonna believe it! That idiot who owns Pistol McSwish's told me I can't play there anymore! What? How come? 'Cause he don't know nothin' about good rock, that's how come. Aw. Wait... Hey, I could play here. Here? Uh, what? Yeah. Nah. Yeah, no. The acoustics in here are not... No. The acoustics in here are great. Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, sounds good in here. Oh, clapping. Clapping's fun. Echo. Echo. Stop. Stop. Echo. Echo.

Yeah, yeah. You noticed that. lmost like you moved around too much. Yeah, I've gotten all kinds of comments, you know-- "you move around a lot," "you seem to be having a hard time." Yeah, I can see that one, a little bit. "You're jumping around for no reason." Right. "You know, your eyes are bulging weird. It's off-putting," this and that-- but that's what they said about Queen. Yeah. Did they? Uh, in rock in general. Hey, uh, Tommy, uh... you know, our place is sort of a family restaurant and... some of your songs are a little risqu??. So I was thinking, maybe don't... Wait. Hold on a second. Before I forget, I got a little mething here for you-- it's your inspection file. There's nothing on here. That's right! Clean slate. You're welcome. Wow. Really? Yeah, come on, shut up. Well, thanks, Tommy. Oh, man. I still got all that mojo flowing through me. You know, I-I got to get it out. I'm gonna take this van to the beach and peel off some burnies.

Hey, this is gross. We came all this way to see old people? Ew! Nasty! You tricked us. I want my money back. Uh-oh. Whoa-whoa, wait, whoa-ho-ho, you guys, you're looking at this the wrong way. You want to see nice bodies?! Get a magazine! This is real, people! Check out that guy. What is that? Is that a liver spot? Is that a birthmark? Is that a third nipple? Who knows? You can't write this crap! Hold up, hold up, hold up. Let me see. I get it. Yeah, I guess, on second look, it's better. This, uh... first song goes pretty deep. It's called "Daddy." Uh... at least it's, uh, uh, a family song. 
??? Daddy! You abandoned me!    Daddy! You sold drugs to me!     Punches are not hugs to me!    ??????
Eh. It's no "Elderly Prostitute." Bobby, you said you talked to him. Uh, I did, kinda. But then he wiped our record clean. 
??? Daddy! You're my enemy!  (sobbing)   You are my enemy! My enemy!   Both:   You are my enemy! My enemy!     My enemy!    ??????

Gene: Hurdles on a beach? What are those silly little skin bags up to now? Wait a second. This can't be. Ow! Uh, guys, you might want to buy seats now, for tomorrow's event. Zeke: "Nudecathlon." 

[00:19:44]


That sounds like decathlon, but nude. They're naked and old and they're bringing home the gold! Go! You go talk to him! All right. Tommy, listen, there's something I need to talk to you about. I was thinking, maybe, um... you could take some time off from performing... uh, here. What? What, what are talking about, Bobby boy? It's just that, um... you know, you could be performing at... at way different places. Huh, it's almost like you're saying you don't want me to play here anymore. No. Not... No. You... took that the wrong way. Uh-huh. What I meant was... you're great. Right. Um, but just not maybe for, for here. I'll tell you what's funny, you know, that's what the manager over at Pistol McSwish's said, too. Did he? Yeah, kind of exactly. Oh. And it's a shame about that guy-- you know, he got shut down by me. What are you doing? You know, I hate to say is, but, you know, you got rat turds on your floor, man, and, yeah, I-I gotta write that up, unfortunately. What? Tommy, that's crazy. You just carry around bags of rat turds in your pocket? Yeah, I don't know what you're talking about. Yeah, look over-- see, I see some more right over here, see? You didn't even empty that one! You're saying a rat just came in here and tossed a bag of its poop on my floor? Yeah, that's a thing that happens. And look, you know, it can all go away. Just let me do an encore, and then come back and play every night. No, Tommy! You're not gonna hold us hostage with your crappy music and your threats! Crappy?! So get out of my restaurant, Tommy! Okay! Of course, you know what this means: Until further notice, you are shut down, my man! Fine! Why don't you get out, my man?! Oh, gladly, my man! Oh, and guess what?! You dohave bulging eyes! And it is off-putting! So, uh... h-how did, uh, how'd it go? Great.

Well, what do you want? You have to cater the Nudecathlon closing ceremony for free. If this is what it takes, this is what it takes. Bob, you do realize what you're getting yourself into.

>>> Set your vcr to record. 
>> This late night talk show host, these intrepid reporters, this politician, and this city bus driver may seem to have nothing in common, but they all share a common bond. Embarrassing, funny, scary. And unbelievable scenarios that all happened on the job. "Caught on camera: A hard day's work." 
>>> Hello, I'm contessa brewer. Welcome to "caught on camera." One of the most embarrassing moments ever at the worst possible time in the worst possible place -- on the job. In this story you'll see professionals doing what they do best until they trip up or slip up and then go with the old saying, laugh at yourself and the world will laugh with you. 
>> This is fashion week over in paris. There was a problem out there today. A model fell down twice. 
>> It looked so funny. I'm still laughing when I see that video. 
>> You're just tickled over that. 
>> It was clear I don't have this anymore. I hope they go to commercial now because I'm about to lose my job. 
>> Wait a minute. Let's start over from the beginning. Kamila is a supermodel living in poland. Jim vance is a veteran newscaster from washington, d.C. They may live worlds apart, but jim and kamila will forever be linked to each other and it's all because of a pair of ridiculously high heels, a watering can, and one very embarrassing video that went viral. Kamila loves her job and was particularly excited to be booked for a fall fashion show, being put on by one of her favorite designers. 

[00:02:27]


>> I love vivian west. She's an amazing designer, so when I went for the casting and I got the job, I was so happy. 
>> At least until the spring/summer 2007 show turned into the fall show. Prior to her stumble. Kamila had been through a fitting for the spring/summer show and everything had gone smoothly. 
>> I went for the fitting, and everything was all right. Tried the shoes. The clothes were made perfectly for me. 
>> And since the theme of the show was springtime, kamila was given a special prop. 
>> They gave me a watering can, and the idea was for me to walk outside with the watering can and put the water on the flowers and keep walking until the end and back. And on the rehearsal, everything, okay, she was okay, watering can, okay. 
>> Unbeknownst to her, there was a last-minute addition right before the show. Her watering can had been filled to the brim. 
>> It was so heavy I couldn't lift it up. Now I have to keep walking with this in this shoes. 
>> No human being can walk in those things. 
>> It was like your foot is put if a funny way so it's hard to walk. 
>> The watering can was bad enough, but what was so funny was the desperate attempt of this, I'm sure, wonderful woman to stay vertical with these absurd shoes. 
>> Jim prides himself on taking his job very seriously, but not on this day. 
>> And when she went down with the can, again, it was like, whoop, there she goes again. That was embarrassing. This was at least the second time. 
>> Well, you are all really just tickled by that, aren't you? You try walking in those shoes. 
>> We want to apologize. 
>> Hold on, hole on. 

[00:04:33]


>> Nothing could have prepared kamila or jim for the attention that came once the video went viral. 
>> I was the star. I was everywhere. I was in the newspaper, in every single news from australia to new york. 
>> There was not a continent except antarctica from which i have not heard. 
>> And then they put the movie on youtube, so everyone like -- I wasn't kamila anymore. But I was, oh, this is the girl from the vivian westwood show. 
>> For both of them there's a silver lining. 
>> I'm really happy that something I did causes other people to feel a little bit of joy. 
>> Hold on hold on. 
>> Everyone can have a rough day, but it doesn't mean anything. Next time you need to wake up and do your job as good as you can. 
>>> Coming up, a 911 operator's worst nightmare comes true. 911, emergency. 
>> There's a fire. 
>> I had to ask her twice to make sure I had the right address. And I realized it was my house. 
>> And a city bus worker's on-the-jobatastrophe. 
>> I looked out the windshield and realize that the bridge pillar is coming, and we're not stopping.

[ bop ] You can do that all you want, I don't like v8 juice. 
[ Male Announcer ] HOW ABOUT V8 V-FUSION. A full serving of vegetables, a full serving of fruit. But what you taste is the fruit. So even you... Could've had a v8. 
>>> What's your emergency? 
>> There's a fire, a big fire. 
>> I had to ask twice to make sure I had the right address. 
>> The flames are about 100 feet in the air. 
>> I realized it was my house. 
>> For veteran 911 operator mike bose, this is not a typical day at the office. Bose along with his parents have lived in quincy, massachusetts, for years. 
>> It's a nice neighborhood right across from a school. Never any trouble on the street. We'd have everybody over during the holidays, christmas, thanksgiving. Kids would always stop by. Kids were there. It was great. 

[00:09:40]


>> Bose always enjoys his job with the city and provides himself on staying cool with the pressure. 
>> Okay, was it a motor vehicle accident? 
>> The people of quincy want someone who's on the other end who won't go crazy or lose it when you call. You have to stay calm and help the city out. 
>> Friday, bose's shift starts like any other. 
>> It was a very busy night. About 10:30, 10:45 it actually started to slow down. We figured we had another hour left on the shift and we'd be gone and it would be over. 
>> But for bose his night is jurting when this 911 call is received. The call is from his neighbor. 911, what's your emergency? 
>> There's a fire next door to my house. 102 hollis avenue. 
>> Let me get the fire department. Stay on the phone. 
>> Okay. 
>> The 911 line, all at once about nine calls started coming in. We figured because of the time of night it was a car accident. So the first call we picked up that I received was my next-door neighbor saying the neighbor's garage and house was on fire. There was an explosion. When I asked her the address, she told me it's 99 hollis ave. I had to ask twice to make sure I had the right address and i realized it was my house. 
>> A neighbor catches it on camera. Not only is bose's house on fire, but his parents are inside. 911, what's your emergency? 
>> There's a fire, big fire at 99 hollis. 
>> A fire or a fight? 
>> The whole place, the garage and everything is on fire. This is michael bose's mother. 
>> Okay, mrs. Bose, we have it. We'll be right there. 
>> The first reaction was to make sure my parents were safe. They were in the house and i tried calling several times. There was no answer. 
>> Mike o'shea is the neighbor who captures it all on camera. 
>> Flames were about 100 feet into the air, and, yeah, you could definitely feel the heat and you could see the houses next to it the paint was just melts and chipping away. 
>> Win minutes bose arrives on the scene. Fortunately, his parents escape the burping home as they make their 911 call. 

[00:11:45]


>> The first thing I know is my parents were on the street with my neighbor. I knew they were fine. It was almost work like slow motion. You don't believe that something's going on and when you look in the back, I could see down the driveway. There was no garage. It was gone. I knew the kitchen, the bedroom area was going to be gone. The roof was gone, the second floor was gone. 
>> As soon as they got it under control, they started smashing out the windows and laying into the upstairs of the house with hoses. 
>> Bose realizes that everything he and his parents own is destroyed. 
>> The new tv I bought, gone. Computers, gone. Everything inside the house was gone. Just the shirt on our back and that was all we had. 
>> Fortunately bose's cousin is a quincy firefighter who arrives first on the scene. 
>> He ran into the house. And there were several pictures of grandkids, wedding pictures of my parents that he was able to save all the pictures that were in there. It meant a lot. When something like this happens, you have friends that come together, but the city of quincy and the quincy police department have been unbelievable, they're with you 24 hours a day helping out. They're doing what they can, even their families, wives, girlfriends, even the kids get involved, which is unbelievable. 
>> For o'shea who witnesses the fire, the scene has a dramatic impact. 
>> It's sad. It's very sad. I went out a couple of days later and bought more smoke detectors. 
>> Despite the devastating fire, bose has an optimistic attitude. 
>> Thank you, sergeant. 
>> My main thing is my parents and my neighbor got out and no injuries. Nobody was hurt, no lives were lost. The fire department, nobody was injured. It's a house that can be rebuilt. Everything can be replaced. It's going to take a while. But we can get back. 
>> Within two weeks bose is back on the job working the 911 phone lines. 
>> One of the first calls we took last night was for a house fire. At first it was -- normal routine. Transferred to the fire department and sent a cruiser down there and you have to be there when they call 911. That's what we do. 

[00:13:47]


>> From one dedicated city worker to another. 
>>> On a saturday evening in albuquerque, new mexico, a bus driver's routine ride takes a frightening turn when he slams into another vehicle then crashes into a bridge pillar. It all starts a little after 5:00 P.M. ON OCTOBER 17th, 2009. The bus drops off several passengers at a busy stop and is heading west on central avenue toward oak street, not far from the university of new mexico campus. Albert sanduval is the bus driver. 
>> I took off and I was just driving and I was going right through my green light and at about the middle of the intersection I looked and there was a little car right in front of me. 
>> The incoming car which is turning left in front of the bus is not slowing down, and the two vehicles collide. 
>> Not even really time to look in the mirror and tell anybody, you know, to brace yourself or nothing it happened that quick. 
>> Christian moore is the security guard onboard the bus. 
>> I hold onto the bar in front of me and try and stable myself. I looked out the windshield and realized that the bridge pillar is coming and we're not stopping. 
>> Not only does the bus hit the car, but the momentum carries the bus forward with the car smashed against it right into a bridge pillar. The bus passengers are flung from their seats. 
>> That's when everything came to a stop, and I was looking at the little car and looking at the pillar and saying I hope those people are okay. 
>> Moore's training kicks in and he and sanduval get the passengers off the bus. 
>> We're lucky that it happened on a saturday evening just because the bus wasn't as crowded. If it was monday through friday at that time, it could have been a lot worse. 
>> No one on the bus is seriously hurt. So their attention goes to the driver of the crashed car, which is smashed against the pillar. 

[00:15:52]


>> It's a little car, and this is a 20, 30-ton vehicle that I'm driving. And it did lift it up and pushed it up against the pillar, and I'm looking at the car here and the pillar right there. My thinking was, you know, i hope those people are okay. 
>> Miraculously, the sole occupant of the car, a 24-year-old driver, suffers four broken ribs but no critical injuries. Christian moore is back to work the next day. Sanduval suffers whiplash but no broken bones. Despite his hard day's work, sanduval is ready to get back behind the wheel. 
>> I'm really looking forward to getting back on my bus and getting back on my normal routine driving every day and just enjoy, you know, the passengers. 
>>> Coming up, a novice politician gets an introduction into the rough and tumble world of politics. 
>> Later. 
>>> And later, if you think the reporter's job is all fun and games, you won't believe what some do all for the sake of the story.

>>> The reforms I'm proposing -- 
>> what do barack obama, george w. Bush, and bill clinton all have in common? 
>> Bill, this is the center of the aids epidemic. 
>> They've been heckled. 
>> And that's why I'm running for president, to do something about it. 
>> And politician ben coniff is proud to be in their company. 
>> It's a rite of passage. 
>> Liar. 
>> We're here again -- 
>> it's not something that i anticipated. 
>> It all starts in march 2009 when lucas county commissioner ben coniff decides to run for mayor of toledo, ohio. 
>> I wanted to give something back. I enjoy politics. I actually find it interesting, stimulating, challenging. 
>> We're here today -- 
>> and when a local television station films him struggling to talk over a relentless heckler, his hard day at work becomes a caught on camera sensation. 
>> Are you done? 
>> No. I'm going to keep going. 
>> Okay. Well, it wasn't what I signed up for. I didn't enter this race for mayor in hopes of becoming a youtube star. That's politics. 
>> Maxwell austin is a toledo resident who follows politics closely and takes them to task. Especially contiff, who said he broke a pledge of ethics not to run for mayor. 
>> He said I plan to stay my term, I'm going to do what I'm going to do, not running for mayor, only a few weeks later to come out and say, you know what, I'm going to run for mayor. 
>> This is an important issue. I want to be able to actually communicate it with people. 
>> Austin is not happy when he sees him campaigning literally at his front door. 
>> I was sitting on my porch one morning. People showed up. Someone approached me to let me know who was going to be coming, and would I want to put on a t-shirt and come down there and join. I let him know what I thought and told them no. 
>> His staff updates him on the situation. 
>> I think there was some indication that there was a guy there who was, you know, a bit ornery, but we decided to go forward with it. 

[00:22:04]


>> We have a situation in toledo. 
>> As he launches into his talking points about faulty water line, austin makes his voice heard. 
>> Run for mayor somewhere else. I seized my opportunity to boo him and call him a liar. 
>> Liar. 
>> Over and over. 
>> Liar. 
>> And over. 
>> Liar. 
>> And over again. 
>> We are had -- 
>> boo, liar, boo. 
>> This is really annoying. I wanted to try and take the high road. 
>> Why don't you let me talk and then you can talk. That's fair. Honestly I wouldn't have minded having a dialogue with the heckler. 
>> Let's get it out of the way and then I can say my piece and you can say your piece and we'll go from there. We'll be civilized about it. No? You're not coming down here? 
>> When he gave me the opportunity, why don't you come down here and talk to the cameras, nope, that's not my job. You know, I'm not running for politics. I think I'm doing a great job sitting on my porch relaxing. 
>> Do you want us to move? 
>> Eventually the heckler forces him and his campaign staffers to change location. 
>> We moved down the block and doing our thing and going on with the day and not thinking a whole lot about it until obviously the video became viral as they say. 
>> You know, it's six degrees of separation in america or maybe even the world, you know. You've got a friend in california. You e-mail it over to them. They're going to spread it to all their friends in california who might have a friend somewhere else and I think it's pretty much what happened. 
>> If you've seen this video, then you're one of tens of thousands around the globe. 
>> It wasn't what I was really wanting to talk about and frankly really wasn't what the community probably should have been talking about, but, you know, I could see it. It was a big story. 
>> Liar. 
>> It's a big story that dovetails with another big story, the beer summit president obama holds at the white house to mend fences between a cambridge, massachusetts, police officer and a harvard professor over a controversial arrest. 
>> And we decided to take a cue from the president. 
>> In that spirit a local toledo television station decides to organize a beer summit of its own featuring ben and maxwell. 

[00:24:12]


>> Good to see you. 
>> Nice to finally meet you. 
>> I feel like a bond, you know what I mean. 
>> A little bit. Yeah, yeah, yeah. 
>> Here you go. 
>> Thank you very much. 
>> A peace offering. 
>> We had our beer. We talked about the city, talked about some of the issues facing young people in the city, facing downtown toledo, which he also had some interest in. So we found some common ground. 
>> It's a very productive evening for me at least. I hope it wasn't too bad for you. 
>> Nope, not at all. I got a free beer out of it. 
>> Got a free beer. 
>> I would be willing to move past our heckling incident and try to get him involved in some way constructively for the community. >>Ut austin prefers to do his opining from the sidelines and doesn't see politics in his future. 
>> Have I ever thought about running for office? No. During the whole booing incident people said, you should run for mayor. You should run for mayor. I don't want to do that. 
>> As for ben, he loses the mayor's race, t he gains a thick skin. And he says, don't count me out yet. 
>> I still am a county commissioner, I'm still interested in giving back to the community and I think public service and politics is a great way to impact the future of toledo. 
>> Coming up, would you ever volunteer to get tased? 
>> What about step into a lion's den? Two reporters who did just that all for the story when "caught 
on camera: A hard day's work" continues.Unteer to help those in need. When a twinge of back pain surprises him. Morning starts in high spirits, but there's a growing pain in his lower back.

It could also mean living with joint damage. Help relieve the pain and stop the damage with humira, adalimumab. For many adults with moderate to severe ra, humira is clinically proven to help relieve pain and stop joint damage. So you can treat more than just the pain. Humira can lower your ability to fight infections, including tuberculosis. Serious, sometimes fatal events, such as infections, lymphoma, or other types of cancer, have happened. Blood, liver and nervous system problems, serious allergic reactions, and new or worsening heart failure have occurred. Before starting humira, your doctor should test you for tb. Ask your doctor if you live in or have been to a region where certain fungal infections are common. Tell your doctor if you have had tb, hepatitis b, are prone to infections or have symptoms such as fever, fatigue, cough, or sores. You should not start humira if you have any kind of infection. Ask your rheumatologist about humira, to help relieve pain and stop further joint damage before they stop you.

>>> I'm milissa rehberger. Here's what's happening. Unusually cold weather has gripped california. Growers in the central valley were relieved as most orange and lemon crops were not affected by the night temperatures in the HIGH 20s. 
>>> And an egyptian court overturned former president mubarak's life sentence a ordered a retrial. More news later. Now back to "caught on camera." 
>>> Welcome back to account caught on camera." I'm contessa brewer. Reporters may go to great lengths for a story. Well, what kind of lengths? Take a look. Television personalities often try what's called the show and tell. A chance for the viewer to see just how something is done. 
>> Ow, that hurt. 
>> But reporter thomas bonet takes the show and tell to a level one might call shocking. Bonet, a lifelong alaskan, lives in fairbanks, a former gold rush boom town that prides itself on natural beauty. While covering crime stories in 2003, bonet learns that police are using taser guns as a crime-fighting tool. His interest is peaked when an officer makes an off hand comment. 

[00:30:21]


>> He sort of jokingly said you should do it. It's a lot of fun. I said, sure, why not. Fateful statement. 
>> Fateful, indeed. A self-described risk taker bonet decides to try it and capture it all on camera. 
>> When I told my co-workers what I was planning to do, I was met with a lot of blank stares. I don't think they really believed me. 
>> Have you ever seen thomas pace before? I never have. 
>> I becamre and more nervous. You know, I was trying to play it off like, I'm not afraid at all but that was absolutely not true. 
>> Bonet decides despite his fear, he should not only go through with the plan, he should make the experience as real as possible. 
>> I figures if I'm going to do this, I'm going to go all out. And they gave me all sorts of options like do you want to get tased for one second, three seconds or five seconds? 
>> Five seconds. That's all there is to it. It will seem a little longer on the other end. It will seem longer than five second but that's all it is is five seconds. 
>> I opted for five seconds. 
>> The barbs are literally an eagle claw fish hook. Once they go in they don't come out without a little effort. 
>> The big moment arrives. Boneeeling more at ease. He hears sergeant eric jukes, a taser instructor at the fairbanks police department has been tased himself numerous times. 
>> I've been shocked with it, i don't know, five, six, seven, eight, ten times, and once it's over, it's over. You're done. You get up and you stand up. There's no clean-up. There's really not a whole lot of recovery. It's over. You're just left with memories. 
>> But when bonet sees the paramedics walk in, he wonders what kind of memories. 
>> THE EMTs WHEELED IN A GURNEY With a crash cart on it and started asking around, what's this for? We don't need this, right? They said, oh, that's just in case. Just in case of what? 
>> Overcoming his cold feet, bonet finally steps onto the mat. 

[00:32:25]


>> All right. Let's do this. 
>> All right. 
>> So stand right here. 
>> That's it. That looks good. 
>> So, like I said, we can see this laser on his back. So the top arm will go there, bottom barb will go down. Are you ready? 
>> Yeah. 
>> Hold him, hold him. Hold him. 
>> Ow. 
>> He shoots ee and after that there's nothing in my mind except for the sheer pain. Ere's nothing. It was just horrendous pain. 
>> Hold him, hold him. Hold him. 
>> And before the electricity was applied, I could actually feel the barbs hit m and plant themselves and then it just hurt like heck. It was insane. And that five seconds felt like an eternity. 
>> How do you feel? 
>> Fine. 
>> Right now? Do you feel any pain? 
>> No. I feel a tickle from where the problems hit my back. 
>> Do you feel like you can move? 
>> Yeah. 
>> Do you feel like you have a clear head? 
>> Like I had hoped there was no residual pain whatsoever. One moment I'm in complete agony and the next what am I doing on the floor. 
>> Hold him, hold him, hold him. 
>> Whenever I see video or even just think of it, of someone being tased, I always think back to myself being tased. That's simply not something you'll forget. 
>>> From one unforgettable moment to another. When this travel reporter visits the legends resort in south africa, he gets more adventure than he bargains for. 
>> Cut, cut, cut. 
>> Hey! 
>> Charlie smithavel writer for "the daily telegraph" in london and a host of tourism videos. He has the perfect job for an adrenaline junky. 

[00:34:27]


>> I think a few people think I've got a death wish. I've been wing walking on a plane. Flying around doing loop de loop. It's pretty terrifying. I've done the biggest bungee jump in the world, the skeleton bobsled which is on this tray where you go down this chute and you go about 60 mile hour. It's pretty terrifying but it's all good fun. 
>> But charlie takes the terrifying moments in stride. 
>> I do this job because of the excitement, because it beats being behind the desk every day and to get the opportunity to travel and if it means I have to get a bit scared at the time, i don't mind that. It's a good trade. 
>> A good trade indeed. For a recent story he and his co-host are out taping tourism videos at a gulf course in south africa. 
>> To do some safari, play some golf. It was all meant to be quite relaxed. None of the adrenaline adventures. 
>> We're here at legends on the 18th green and we're meant to be going up to the mountain for the extreme 19th but unfortunately the weather has been a little delayed because the clouds are low. 
>> Another plan has been hatched. 
>> I've been told we're going into the lion's den. 
>> No, no, that's been changed again. That's not we're going into the lion's den. You're going into the lion's den. 
>> He said, why don't you go and meet the lion handler. He's got a baby lion. I thought that will be sweet. We're just off to get breakfast before I become the lion's breakfast. 
>> Charlie doesn't realize how accurate he is. 
>> Turned up that the lion handler's cage and there was a lion that looked enormous. I said that's not a baby. He said it's called baby lion. That's his name. Charlie decides that despite his doubts, the shoot must go on especially after being reassured by the lion handler. 
>> I wasn't sure whether i should go in. You see the sign, prowling up and down pouring at the cage. I spoke to the lion handler. He's raised lions and leopards and hyenas. He said it's safe. I've got control over it. I can tell if it's in a bad mood and if it is I wouldn't let you in. 
>> Right before charlie steps into the cage, the lion handler gives him some unsettling advice. 

[00:36:32]


>> He says, if anything goes wrong, you can't run and you have to try to look like you're not scared. In I went and the door closed behind me. At first I was there crouching down stroking the lion and it's sort of poring at me a bit. 
>> Scratch the lion's belly. 
>> It scratched my leg. But nothing. It's just playing around. 
>> He likes you. 
>> Even when the lion gets into a tussle with his handler, charlie's not ruffled. 
>> Hey, hey. He just wants to play. 
>> But the playful lion now turns to charlie. 
>> Then it started to get up andit got up on its hind legs and that's when I felt the claws go into my back legs. And they're an inch long. 
>> The lion's claws, and then its teeth, are now digging into charlie's body. 
>> I started to feel pain, like burning pain which went in. And then he let go. I mean thankfully otherwise I'd probably be missing, you know, a good quarter of my leg. 
>> Charlie's instinct is to run away from the lion but he remembers what the handler told him. 
>> The handler said before we went in, you have to try to not look scared. If you run, you become prey and the natural instinct will be to kill you. 
>> Just when charlie thinks the lion is under control, it comes back for more. 
>> You can hear it roaring and growling and you can hear your own heart beat. You're so scared. 
>> In an instant charlie comes eye to eye with the animal. 
>> It seems slow motion. But you sort of look around and see the mouth open, see its eyes which are kind of yellow eyes and when they fix the stare on you, you just feel like you're an ant. You feel like so small and you're its little play thing. That's the moment when I thought I'm in trouble. 
>> When the handler distracts the lion charlie is able to make his escape. 

[00:38:35]


>> I looked like a kind of tarzan figure with all these shredded trousers and cut t-shirt and jacket. 
>> Charlie goes to the local hospital for stitches on his shoulder and his leg. He had made a last-minute wardrobe change before entering the den which may have saved his life. 
>> Africa is usually pretty hot but this morning it was cold so I was just wearing a t-shirt and thankfully grabbed my ski jacket, which gives you padding. Because basically the lion's claws would go through the material. It's tough material and it gets stuck so it couldn't pull away. If it was just a t-shirt it would go into your flesh and pull through and then it would have been a different story. I probably would have been in hospital for a lot longer or worse. 
>> Despite his brush with death charlie keeps his torn clothes for memories. 
>> I thought after maybe i should throw it away but then i thought I should keep it for the grandkids. 
>> Needless to say charlie doesn't have any plans to enter a lion's den any time soon. 
>> I put them in two different categories. The scary things that are scary because you get frightened doing them but they're not dangerous. You're not going to die from them. It's if you've got the guts. Then this lion incident, that's just dangerous and in hindsight pretty stupid to do. 
>>> Coming up, this preacher's slip of the tongue becomes a youtube sensation. 
>> You heard nothing else. This is church, my gosh. 
>> A salesclerk's frightening encounter. 
>> Stay back. 
>> And a cop's dance moves has everyone talking. 
>> Everybody out of the pool. 
>>> When "caught on camera: A hard day's work" continues. ?????? ?????? I have direct deposit on my visa prepaid. My paycheck is loaded right on my card. Automatic. I am not going downtown standing in line to cash it. I know where my money is, because it is in my pocket. I got more time with my daughter, we got places to go. 

[00:40:41]


[ Freeman ] GO OPEN A NEW WORLD, With visa prepaid. More people go with visa. 

[00:43:37]


>>> This preacher packs the house every sunday. 
>> My name is blake and I'm the national campus pastor. 
>> But he's known for a slip of the tongue during a sermon a few years ago. 
>> We talked about how lot goes to go pinch his -- excuse me. 
>> His embarrassing moment is witnessed first by his congregation of 300 people. 
>> Stop laughing, all right? Man. 
>>> And then by thousands around the world when his blooper goes viral. 
>> I hope this isn't on videotape because I'm -- I'll have no job now. 
>> Blake bergstrom gets flustered while sharing a biblical of abraham and his nephew lot with a large youth group at a church in colorado where he had been aouth pastor for only two months. 
>> Pinch his tents is what i said. And you heard nothing else here. 
>> Lot said, I want the green land that's plush. The bible said he pitched his tent. And it was too close to sodom and gomorrah. He said, listen, the people you will hang out with will become. Bad company always corrupts good character and so I was talking about that. And then I was talking about he pitched his tent too close to those two cities. Man, it was a great message. But the message gets muddied. 
>> I was challenging you guys not to do is to pick friends that were going to lead you -- stop laughing, all right? 
>> I just jacked it up. I said lot chose to pinch his -- 
>> I'm just like trying to push through like -- 
>> am I red right now? Holy cow. 
>> I'll just act like we're good. We're going to keep rolling. So what I was saying is that -- 
>> inside blake fears the worst. 
>> I just thought, oh, great. I just moved here. I've got four kids. We don't even have a place to stay yet. This is horrible. We are so done. This is over. I'm going to be fired. You know, I just thougt was over. 

[00:45:51]


>> His wife ali is in the audience thinking the same thing. 
>> The very moment that those words came out of his mouth -- 
>> to go pinch his -- excuse me. 
>> A million thoughts went through my mind like did he really just say that? He really just said that. Is he going to have a job tomorrow? And I think I sat there with my hand over my mouth like, oh, my goodness, this really happened. This is happening. It really happened. I think I was a bit in shock. 
>> But their shock turns to relief when laughter fills the church. Then I saw everybody laughing, the parents laughing and it was like, okay, this is -- it's going to be okay. This is funny. This is just funny. There's nothing you can do about it. 
>> Blake's popularity among his youth group soars. 
>> At that ministry after that happened, my teenagers started putting it on their ipods and they started taking it to the school and when they'd go to the school, they're showing it to their friends like, dude, you've got to meet my pastor, this is hilarious. This is what he said. 
>> And he becomes that guy on youtube in christian circles. brian DeShawn interviewed him for a pastor job at nashville's cross point church. 
>> At the time I had no idea he was that guy, had no idea he was that guy on youtube. So I had this great conversation with him. A couple days later we had a meeting and they explained. I thought, oh, my gosh, that's him. That was that guy. 
>> But blake said his ability to laugh at himself after his embarrassing "caught on camera" moment has made him not holier than thou but someone everyone can relate to. 
>> Pitch his -- is what said and you heard nothing else. This is church, my god. 
>> Katrina had just happened and there was a whole bunch of people that shot me e-mails that said thank you. I haven't laughed in that long. They said this is such an encouragement to me and i actually want to go back to church now. Because I was able to laugh -- it was funny and I laughed. And I made a mistake and I own it. It's like all of a sudden people are like, I like that guy. He's kind of a dork like me. 

[00:48:04]


>> Stop laughing, all right? Man. 
>> From a slip of the tongue to a slip on the floor makes a hot hollywood actress and a favorite late night talk show host in a playful sketch and what go you get, big ratings, right? Well, for conan o'brien, teri hatcher's appearance on his show in october of 2009 really knocks him out. It starts when hatcher suggests she and o'brien do a mock triathlon together. 
>> It was supposed to end with teri racing into the studio, rushing down the steps and coming right here to the finish line. 
>> But watch what happens when the two approach the stage for the big finish. 
>> And I'm a big guy. I'm a big guy, I'm about 6'4" and I went back and hit my head. In that moment I saw stars but i tried to keep going. 
>> The audience is laughing and conan, the consummate professional doesn't let on he's hurt. 
>> Let's see a slow motion replay of what happened right there. I believe I won. God. 
>> That was so close. 
>> I did not win. The winner is teri hatcher, ladies and gentlemen. 
>> After the taping conan goes to the hospital. That fall was no laughing matter. Conan suffers a concussion. Back at work within days he tells parents to have their children watch his fall as a cautionary tale. 
>>> Coming up -- a salesperson attacked by a customer, plus a cop with some arresting moves. 
>> By the way, I do we knee pads if anybody's interested. 
>> When "caught on camera: A hard day's work" continues. By the armful? By the barrelful? The carful? How about...By the bowlful? Campbell's soups give you nutrition, energy, and can help you keep a healthy weight. Campbell's. It's amazing what soup can do. me. depression. Before taking abilify, an antidepressant alone helped me get out from under. But sometimes...Depression still dragged me down. I'd been feeling stuck for a long time. So my doctor added abilify to my antidepressant. She said some people had symptom improvement as early as 1 to 2 weeks. Now I feel more in control of my depression. 

[00:50:27]


[ Female Announcer ] ABILIFY IS NOT FOR EVERYONE. Call your doctor if your depression worsens or you have unusual changes in behavior, or thoughts of suicide. Antidepressants can increase these in children, teens, and young adults. Elderly dementia patients taking abilify have an increased risk of death or stroke. Call your doctor if you have high fever, stiff muscles, and confusion to address a possible life-threatening condition. Or if you have uncontrollable muscle movements, as these could become permanent. High blood sugar has been reported with abilify and medicines like it and in extreme cases can lead to coma or death. Other risks include increased cholesterol, weight gain, decreases in white blood cells, which can be serious, dizziness on standing, seizures, trouble swallowing, and impaired judgment or motor skills. Depression was always hanging over me. Then my doctor added abilify to my antidepressant. Now I feel better. 
[ Female Announcer ] IF YOU'RE STILL STRUGGLING With depression talk to your doctor to see if the option of adding abilify is right for you. Nd be sure to ask about the free trial offer. number-one office superstore ink retailer in america. Now get $6 back in staples rewards for every ink cartridge you recycle when you spend $50 on hp ink. Staples. That was easy. 

[00:53:04]


>>> A retail clerk is viciously attacked by a customer wielding a tire iron. ON SEPTEMBER 24th, 2009, AT THE Name brand clothing exchange in mesa, arizona, it's another routine day. Britney scribner is a manager at the store. 
>> The womanad come in and went over to the men's section, was shopping, looking through things. 
>> But when this shopper brings three shirts to the register, she attacks with a deadly weapon in hand. 
>> As soon as the drawer popped open, she took out a tire iron and hit her on the neck right here. Of course, it, stunned her. She stepped back. Didn't realize that it had been a tire iron at the time. You know, she just thoughthe girl her. 
>> The girl did hit her and delivered blow after blow to the cowering clerk. 
>> She put up her hands to block the next hit and ended up hitting her wrists or her hand area. 
>> With the cash drawer open, the assailant takes the money from the register while threatening the clerk. 
>> Stay back. Stay back right here. Right here. 
>> Unfortunately, for this robber, several surveillance cameras posted around the store capture her every move. Within a few days, police have a break in the case. 
>> We have very good video surveillance of her, and that provided the information that we needed to be able to identify her. 
>> Police arrest karla janeth jauregui, a student at a university. How's this for irony, the suspect's major? Criminal justice. Her stated motive, money troubles. Jauregui pled guilty to aggravated assault and armed robbery and was sentenced to five years in prison. Police say the surveillance footage was a critical component to the investigation. 
>> Any time a business has good surveillance video, it's going to be helpful. Whenever you have someone who commits a violent crime, you want to get them off the street as soon as you can because there's a tendency of them committing another violent crime. 

[00:55:09]


>> As for the clerk, she suffers hand injuries and returns to work almost two weeks after the attack. Finally, for everyone out there who's put in a hard day's work, an example of someone making the best of it. As you'll see, this officer takes his beat quite seriously. In providence, rhode island, there's tony lapour with his white gloves and whistle directing traffic. 
>> I'm not going to argue with that truck. He was too big. 
>> He may look like an ordinary cop, but the residents of this new england town have found that tony is anything but ordinary. 
>> Everybody out of the pool. Through a flurry of whistle, tweets and flashy dance moves, tony, a retired beat cop, performs the routine that he's been perfecting for more than 25 years. 
>> Always wanted to be a performer growing up. So I could look at dance steps and know what to do just watching them on television. I would go out and do a couple of hand movements and a couple of spins. And once I saw our boss come down the street, I would go back and do it the traditional way so they wouldn't catch me. I did it consistently after that for a half hour to 45 minutes a day. 
>> Tony was already a local legend by the time he made an appearance on "nightly news" with tom brokaw. 
>> Well, I can tell it's monday. I haven't gotten one smile today yet. 
>> "Countdown with keith olbermann." 
>> Finally to providence, rhode island, where no holiday season be complete without tony lapore directing traffic as the dancing traffic cop. 
>> And the "today" show. 
>> It's the return of tony lapore, the dancing traffic cop. He's entertained them for years with his fancy footwork. 
>> I love that guy, sarah. 
>> Isn't he great? 
>> And since providence is still buzzing about the dancing cop, we decided to check out his act. 

[00:57:13]


[ Whistles ] ???????????? 
[ whistles ] ???????????? 
>> tony is, in fact, so well known around providence that he credits his celebrity status with helping tfight crime. 
>> I've caught bank robbers, guys with guns down here because people actually knew who I was by first name. And they would tell me, hey, something's going down in the outlook garage, or something's going down at the bus station. Boom, boom, boom, I would go. 
>> You think I didn't recognize you? How you doing, buddy? They may not have gone to another police officer. 
>> Tony finds dancing provides stress relief during a hard day's work. And he turns an intersection into a stage. On this fall day, a few minutes into his routine, people start to gather on the sidewal some staring in disbelief. Watch what happens as tony gets into his groove. 
>> I have certain moves with certain traffic movement, and i have names for them when I go back. I call it the butterfly. Then I have another one I call the crazy leg. Then I do the john travolta. Did you ever watch "saturday night fever?" Did you ever see him go down on his knees and bounce back up? By the way, I do wear knee pads, if anybody's interested. 
>> At 62 years old, tony sees no end in sight to his routine. He enjoys what he's doing too much. 

[00:59:15]


>> It's very, very important to enjoy what you're doing. In my presentations when I go to the scho I tell the children they all have a gift inside of them. They have a skill they have to perfect. And when they do, they'll be happier on what they're doing when they're adults. And that's how I feel. 
>> Next time you're having a hard day's work, I hope you think of tony and his dance moves. And if you have a video you'd like to send to us, you can logon to our website, caughtoncamera.Msnbc.Com. I'm contessa brewer. That's all for this edition of

=======================================================

[ Male Announcer ] SAVE ON GROUND SHIPPING AT FedEx OFFICE. 
>>> From pie to eggs to shoes. 
>> Look at that. That is quick. 
>> Politicians show they can dish it out, and they can take it. 
>> He didn't think. He just went -- 
>> from a slap in the face -- 
>> I couldn't believe what I was seeing. 
>> -- To chewing over a piece of legislation. 
>> There are people pulling her hair, trying to get her to spit it out. It's unbelievable. 
>> Lawmakers engaged in all-out brawling. 
>> Nothing is under control, you know, just violence. Just rage. 
>> And which of these slip-ups gets your vote for most embarrassing? 
>> Uh-oh. You hate it when that happens. ?????? What is your name ?????? 
>> politicians like you've never seen them before. "Caught on camera: Politics gone wild." 
>>> Hello. I'm contessa brewer. Welcome to "caught on camera." Once upon a time politicians were revered. After all, they have the ability to pass bills, create laws, and govern entire countries, but sometimes they're the subject of ridicule, taunted, heckled, and harassed by the public, under constant fire from their opponents, and even their own parties. This hour is all about what happens when politicians are pushed too far. 
>> I think it was lyndon johnson, the u.S. President, who said, if you want a friend in politics, get a dog. Politics is all about adversity, whether it's psychological or sometimes even physical. 
>> In britain, this is just how the public showed their disdain. Physically. Politicians are routinely subjected to egging, custard-throwing, flour-pelting, and paint-hurtling. 

[00:02:07]


>> We've been brought up in pantomime. It's perfectly harmless fun and a way of expressing irritation, anger. It's become a quite common practice to show things that are colored, that will cling, liquid or flour or whatever, because that looks good on the telly. 
>> In the face of indignity, politicians are trained to stay calm, simply to brush it off and walk away. But even they can be egged on to the breaking point. 
>> It's probably dumb, but i love it when the politicians fight back and attack their attackers. 
>> No one does this better than deputy prime minister john prescott in 2001, taking one for england right on the cheek. 
>> The guy who threw the egg was half his age, to start, and was very close. Might have got it in his eye, might have actually injured him. 
>> There was a lot of jostling and abuse. I felt a bang on the back of my head. 
>> Unluckily for his attacker, mr. Prescott had trained as a boxer in his youth. 
>> He didn't think. He just want, bam! 
>> I immediately responded to defend myself, and that's how it happened. 
>> It's one thing if someone throws something at you. It's another if someone attempts to punch you and then you punch back. 
>> John prescott actually did himself a lot of good by his instant angry reaction to the guy who threw the egg, and i think the rest of the nation said, good for you, chum, that's absolutely right. This guy is going to behave with disrespect, you sorted him. 
>> Including, it seems, the prime minister himself, who applauds his deputy during a press conference. 
>> He has got very, very great strengths. Not least in his left arm. 
>> The dazed and bruised protester is taken away in cuffs and spends several hours in police custody before being released. Neither man is charged. 
>> Who are you going to charge? And what are you going to charge them with? That was the middle of an election campaign as well. Tempers ran a little high in an election campaign. That's all. 

[00:04:13]


>> After all, just another day in british politics. 
>> Of course, I regret the incident. But why should we be subjected to that kind of protest? I think it's wrong. 
>> Don't think the fun and games is just for the british? During the 2003 total recall election in california, one protester takes arnie's name a little too seriously and schwarzeneggs him on the shoulder. 
>> Well, this is an effort to make somebody look foolish and politicians sometimes don't need any extra help, and that is the purpose. When an egg splatters on somebody's coat, it's great video. 
>> As if nothing happened, schwarzenegger peels off his jacket, continues to glad-hand with the crowd, and goes on to give his speech as planned. 
>> I think it's all in the reaction. You learn a lot about the politician. Schwarzenegger had a great line later. 
>> This guy owes me bacon now. There's no two ways about it. Because I mean you just can't have eggs without bacon. But this is just all part of the free speech. 
>> Another silent but somewhat tastier attack happens in the netherlands in 2000. During a press conference on the hotly contested kyoto agreement, greenpeace advocates protest against america. They claim it's not reducing greenhouse emissions fast enough. 
>> The united states, which admittedly was a big part of the cause of the problem because we had been an industrial mite for so long, all of a sudden is viewed by many as a heavy. We viewed ourselves as trying our damnedest to actually find solutions, but they weren't pure enough for some. 
>> One protester takes matters into her own hands, throwing a pie at u.S. Undersecretary for global affai frank loy. 
>> Iad to make an immediate decision whether to be outraged or to treat it lightly. And I decided for the latter. This incident occurred the day before american thanksgiving, and I said, standing there with this stuff dripping off of me, i said, you would have thought that on the day before thanksgiving they could have picked pumpkin pie rather than cherry cream. 

[00:06:18]


>> A pie in the face is standard vaudeville stuff. I think you can get away with it because a pie in the face is something people do for fun. 
>> The press conference is suspended, and mr. Loy is supplied with security and a new suit. 
>> The next day we had a press conference and I was in the same spot, and I opened the conference by saying, now, look, my last clean suit. If there are any more pie throwers out there -- and i pointed to my colleague next to me, but there were no more pie throwers. 
>> Seems as though they had all been dragged away by the scruff of their necks. Undeterred by the attack, frank loy continues to work to reduce the world's greenhouse emissions. 
>> If you argue today that this is all a made-up crisis, you really are in the flat earth category of believers. 
>>> Now watch as one woman tries to do something many people have dreamed about. No, not winning the lottery. Arresting karl rove. 
>> I have to do a citizen's arrest for treason. 
>> Clearly she's trying to add a little pizzazz to an otherwise boring meeting for mortgage bankers. It will take more than this to wake everyone up, including karl rove, it seems. 
>> What's funny to me about the woman trying to handcuff karl rove is this may not be the last time someone attempts to handcuff karl rove. 
>> It looks like she's the only one who ends up being carted away. 
>>> In december 2009, an attacker strikes italian prime minister silvio berlusconi in the face with a souvenir statue of the drobo. It wasn't long before there was a new souvenir in italy. 
>>> And then there's the famous shoe incident. The one where an iraqi journalist decides to trade in the traditional food-throwing for shoe-hurling and aims right for president bush's head. 

[00:08:26]


>> Now, watch bush's athletic instincts here. Anybody else would have gotten hit by that shoe. Look at that. That is quick. He also had a pretty good line after it. 
>> It doesn't bother me. And if you want the facts, it's a size 10 shoe that he threw. 
>> Now, that's showing some true wit in response to a ridiculous event. He rose to the occasion on this one and dodged the shoe. 
>> It's very important, I think, to be quick-witted in politics. It's very important, first of all, to know what it is you want to say and to be saying it with some passion and some sincerity and then some wit gets back at you. You want to go splotch. You want to score another point. 
>> President bush manages to shrug it off and even makes light of the situation. But this is far from a joke in many people's minds. 
>> It's easy to make that sound comic, but it was a serious thing about the way iraqis see the british and american incursion. They see it as an army of occupation. 
>> The chap was then hauled off. You can clearly hear yelling as he was being beaten up in the room next door. It would have credited bush if he would have said, leave him alone. 
>> The event sparks controversy when he's jailed for nine months for his crime. The public then throws something unexpected at the 29-year-old journalist. Their support. Protesting all around the world for his release. 
>> He's been released now, and he's being treated as a hero. 
>>> For all of you politicians out there, whether you find a shoe, custard, eggs, or pie flying at your head, we have just one piece of advice for you. 
>> Duck. 
>>> Coming up -- politics gets personal in prague. 
>> Something was going to happen if you put these two alpha males in the same room together. 

[00:10:35]


>>> And southern charm flies out the window in the alabama state senate. 
>> He called me a son-of-a-bitch, okay? Where I grew up, that's somebody talking bad about your mother. 
>> When "caught on camera: POLITICS GONE WILLED" RETURNS.[ Man ] Ring ring... Progresso This reduced sodium soup says it may help lower cholesterol, how does it work?

>>> Let's face it. Many of us have felt like punching a colleague at some point. Most of us go only as far as imagining fist striking jaw, but we're not all so restrained. Just ask politicians in the czech republic. 
>> This fight occurred in may 2006, I think two weeks before general elections in the czech republic. It was quite a highly politically charged atmosphere. More heated. The deputy prime minister takes the stand at a conference and strikes his health minister. 
>> Seemed like a conventional boring speech, and then excitement. 
>> No one knew it was going to happen. I think it really did come out of the blue. 
>> And no one is more stunned than the abused health minister. 
>> At first it seemed like the victim here was going to be above it all and show some dignity and take his slap on the head and leave. 

[00:14:52]


>> He's obviously stopped by an adviser. Presumably he said, you can' just let him get away with it, get back in there, and the audience loves that. 
>> You empowered me from behind, why didn't you face me like a man? You're a coward, he says. 
>> There's a real punch-and-judy aspect to it. 
>> I think this guy was trying to talk his way out of it and got beaten up more. 
>> But what could have sparked such a public display of anger? There could only be one answer. A woman. 
>> The quarrel developed after he insulted him by accusing him of marrying for money. 
>> In the tough guy world, if you're accused of something like that, you're not a real man, so he was defending his manhood by slapping the other guy on the head with a pretty childish way of showing your manhood, if you ask me. 
>> Talk about airing your dirty laundry in public. 
>> It wasn't long, of course, before the incident escaped the borders of the czech republic and was being shown on tv stations all over the world. So it was a slap that was heard around the world. 
>> This sort of thing used to happen in american legislative chambers a lot, even in the u.S. Senate. A century ago. I guess we've outgrown it. 
>> Or have we? If you thought american politicians were above childish play, hold on to your hats and take a look at this next clip. 
>> Oh! 
>> Good old-fashioned american brawl, wouldn't you know it would be alabama. 
>> Southern hospitality flies right out the window during a legislative session in montgomery, alabama, in 2007. The day ends with a bang. Or more literally a punch. 
>> Oh! 
>> Uh-oh. There it is. That was quite a punch. That was a roundhouse punch it looked like. 
>> Oh, my gosh. Oh, my gosh. 
>> Journalist rhonda colvin covers the state senate for alabama public television and was there that day. 

[00:16:59]


>> It was the last day of the session, so usually they stay until about midnight, getting a lot of last-minute legislation through. It was very mundane, actually. 
>> But mundane quickly turns to exciting when senators from both sides of the floor start spatting. 
>> And you can see between mr. Barren and mr. Bishop there was a heated exchange. 
>> Republican senator charles bishop and democratic senator lowell barren, both notoriously outspoken, begin to argue heatedly. 
>> You definitely see when you watch the tape that there are some words being exchanged and you're not quite sure what they're saying, but you knew that there was an argument at least. We didn't know, you know, what the outcome would be, but we just sat there and watched it for a little bit, and all of a sudden it happened and it happened very quickly. Mr. Bishop had hit mr. Barren. He had punched him. And there was a little bit of a struggle for a few seconds. The security guards ran out. They tried to break them up. A few other legislators also tried to get in between them. The punch was very quick, and the struggle was very quick, and the breakaway between the two, that was also quick. So it happened in a matter of seconds. 
>> He had just a standard all-american punch thrown. One punch thrown. Everybody else pulls the two apart. 
>> I couldn't believe what I was seeing, you know. You're sort of like a car crash or a train wreck. You're looking at it and you're, like, did I just see that? What just happened? 
>> But what did just happen? What plunged these southern gentlemen to such undignified depths? Yep, you guessed it. A woman. Again. 
>> He called me a son-of-a-bitch. Okay? Where I grew up, that's somebody talking bad about your mother. And when he did, I responded with my right hand. 
>> Not so, says the shaken democratic senator. 
>> I really don't know what set the gentleman off. He walked over to where I was sitting in my chair, and he said, you'd better watch your back. I'm going to be here for the next three years, and I'm going to "f" you every day. And I turned and I said, I don't give a darn. And about that time I saw a punch coming. 

[00:19:11]


>> And come it did. Smack on the jaw. Unfortunately, we may never know for sure what was said on that dark day in american politics. 
>> Our cameraman, he came back to our station. I know for days he tried to manipulate the video to slow it down to see if he could see what they were saying or read lips. And we really don't know what was said. 
>> Luckily, chivalry is not required in the alabama state senate. Both men kept their jobs. 
>> Am I going to apologize for it? No. I'm going home. Y'all have a good day. 
>>> Coming up -- things heat up in south korea. 
>> If you want to be a politician in korea, a black belt in tae kwon do may not be a bad thing to have. 
>> A lawmaker with a tasteless strategy. 
>> We can't vote on this bill because it's in her mouth. And she's chewed it up.

>>> in some countries, the national assembly can look more like a boxing ring than a political arena. 

[00:23:17]


>> I think the most notorious are probably south korea and taiwan in about the last 10 to 15 years that have gotten a lot of attention around the world. 
>> In fact, in 1995 the magazine "the anals of probable research" awards taiwan the ignoble peace prize for demonstrating that politicians gain more by punching, kicking and gouging each other than by raging war against other nations. 
>> The taiwanese parliament probably experiences some kind of episode of disruption in almost every session. 
>> During taiwan's two sessions per year, lawmakers have chewed over every option to prevent bills from being passed. Literally. 
>> The craziest moment to me was definitely not a fight but this moment where one of the legislators, a woman, gets up in front of the legislature, grabs the paper away from the person who's holding it, and eats it. So we can't vote on this bill because it's in her mouth and she's chewed it up, and there are people pulling her hair, trying to get her to spit it out. I mean, it was unbelievable. 
>> Lately the speaker of the house has gotten smart, reading the proposals himself at the podium. But never fear. Some taiwanese lawmakers have made a way around that one, too. 
>> He didn't have that podium for very long. Either they knew what he was going to say or they didn't like what he said. 
>> Another way to slow down the process is to occupy the speaker's desk because the speaker has to be behind his desk using his microphone in order to conduct the business of the chamber. So if you can push the speaker out of the way and take over his desk, then you can also stop the process from happening. 

[00:25:18]


>> Tackling the speaker also proves effective. 
>> Oh, a well-executed running tackle here by an older fellow. He could play football. 
>> Staging protests inside parliament is another successful tactic. 
>> One of the most interesting things about these legislative brawls is that they're usually not spontaneous. At least not in taiwan. I mean, they look spontaneous. It looks like all of a sudden people are rushing up to the front and there's this big mosh pit and up on the top there's a big scrum. It looks like somebody just lost his temper and went nuts. But almost always it's actually planned in advance. 
>> Here you have very dedicated brawlers. They planned ahead. They've got placards, they've got costumes. 
>> They wear a special outfit on the day they're going to fight. Once I was interviewing a legislative assistant about this. He said, oh, yeah, we get a memo, e-mail in the morning that says, tell the boss to wear sneakers and the party vest today because we're going to have some action. 
>> Planned or not, these brawls often turn violent and injuries can be serious. 
>> The most famous is the bloody face of the guy who got hit with a cell phone on his eyebrow and split his eyebrow and blood all down his face. He had ten large stitches and 100 small stitches. So it must have been a pretty nasty cut. 
>>> And there have been other casualties during intense legislative sessions, namely ruined suits. 
>> Another very shocking but also kind of funny moment was the fight where they threw their boxed lunches at each other. 
>> This clip gives a whole new meaning to a sticky situation. 
>> This is what happens when you serve lunch during a meeting. 
>> There's rice in there, stir fried vegetables in there. There's like a pork chop or a chicken leg. So when they hauled off and threw the boxes across the legislature, the food was just flying out and all of this greasy chinese food raining down on the legislators. 

[00:27:29]


>> So why are fights so common in taiwan? What is it about the country's political system that breeds such frustration? 
>> I think the key to understanding the political violence or particularly the legislative violence in taiwan is to understand that taiwan is a relatively new democracy. UNTIL THE 1980s, TAIWAN WAS A Single-party authoritarian state. 
>> IN THE 1980s, TAIWAN BEGINS To democratize. However, when marshal law is abolished in 1987, political brawls go on the rise. In addition, taiwan's ruling political party remains the minority in the legislature. 
>> They still couldn't get their stuff through the legislature because they didn't have a majority of seats. So it's like when you have a republican president and a democratic majority in the u.S. Congress. There's always a lot more conflict. 
>> So is there any hope that taiwan will be able to stabilize its political system in the near future, rendering these fights a thing of the past? 
>> I'm pretty confident that taiwan will develop some mechanisms for smoothing over the worst and most violent of these legislative conflicts. 
>> But until then grab some popcorn, sit back, and enjoy the show. And you don't have to look far from taiwan to find more political punch-outs. 
>> If you want to be a politician in korea, a black belt in tae kwon do may not be a bad thing to have. 
>> Fights are so common in south korea's parliament that they've become a spectator sport. 
>> This looks like a coup. I don't know if you'd want them in charge. 
>> There has been a ritual aspect to confrontation in korean society. One of the challenges with korea as a relatively new democracy is that this is not really a political culture in which debate and compromise are prized. 
>> Since 2004 the south korean parliament has dissolved numerous times into uncontrolled mass brawls. 2004 was a year in which we saw major change in the composition of the national assembly. It became younger. There was the introduction of a new labor party. And they brought with them the street protest tradition, to a certain extent they brought the street into the national assembly. 

[00:29:51]


>> Whether the subject is education reform or impeachment, free trade deals or government relocation, you can be sure that fists will be raised and punches will be thrown. 
>> A lot of pushing and shoving, a lot of competition to really gain control over the physical instruments of power, for instance, the speaker's podium or the gavel. Hammers and fire extinguishers. There were draft bills being thrown. Cameras in the national assembly. Paper actually makes a good theatrical effect. 
>> Theater is really all it is. Unlike in taiwan where political brawling often sways an outcome. Scott snyder says the punch-ups we see in the korean assembly are all for show. 
>> Usually they are related to ritual confrontations or situations where a measure or a law is about to be passed. The assemblymen already know what the outcome is going to be, but they need to show their constituents that they have done everything they can in order to try to stop it from being passed. It's a ritual fight to show your loyalty even for a lost cause. 
>> Well, guys, even if you're not changing history, you sure are getting a good workout. 
>>> Coming up -- uh-oh, look out. Mikes and paperweights fly through the air in india. 
>> Mikes and paperweights have become like missiles. 
>>> Plus, somali's fight over whether to allow peace-keeping forces into their country. 
>> The ultimate irony of this one is this was a fight about peacekeepers. 
>> It was quite dangerous because of the way they were using chairs and sticks. I mean, someone could have gotten killed. 
>> When "caught on camera: Politics gone wild" returns. Thank you so much. I appreciate it. I'll be right back. They didn't take a dime. How much in fees does your bank take to watch your money?

[00:34:43]


>>> Here's what's happening. The president of the national rifle association says congress is not likely to pass an assault weapons ban claiming the gun lobby has support to block it. Residents of newtown, connecticut are gathering today to talk about whether to tear down the school where a funman killed 26 people replacing it with a memorial. And gas prices have surged seven sent in the last three weeks, up to an average of 3.32 a gallon. More news later. Now back to "caught on camera." 
>>> Hello. Welcome back to "caught on camera." I'm contessa brewer. Whether they're lashing out in public, fighting one on one, or brawling en masse, politicians sure know how to disagree with each other. India, october 1997. The state assembly erupts into violence. This man is a political adviser, and he has a ringside seat at the spectacular event. 
>> It was expected that there may be some shouting slogans, throwing of something. But physical manhandling and physically throwing of objects to the extent of injuring the other persons, it was not expected. 
>> The ruling party in power for only one month is suddenly in danger of losing its majority. 
>> The issue was a vote of confidence for the state government. 
>> If this was a vote for confidence, it didn't succeed. I can imagine the voters not having much confidence in these guys. 
>> When state assembly members are called on to vote whether to replace the bjp party, things get ugly. 
>> As soon as the voting is starting and the shouting is becoming noisy -- 
>> uh-oh. Now they're throwing things, furniture, everything. 

[00:36:46]


>> It initially started with paperweights. Then the mikes are taken from the desks and thrown to the other side, and they're quite heavy objects. Mikes and paperweights have become like missiles. 
>> They look like they could do some damage. Now, there's some nice form on that toss. 
>> As the scene descends from disruption into total disarray, those caught up in the fray take cover. 
>> The scene has become very violent, even physical, manhandling. 
>> Undeterred by the chaos around him, the speaker carries on. He's determined that the vote proceed and be counted that day. 
>> So the marshals try to intervene. They try to make a shield around the speaker to save him because the speaker was going on with the proceedings. 
>> My favorite was the security guards holding up what appeared to be chair seats or something as a shield. 
>> The shield does the trick. The speaker is able to push the vote through, and the bjp party, it seems, will be allowed to stay in power. The trouble-making opposition parties, however, won't give up. That afternoon they storm the governor's house, and the governor intervenes on their behalf, dismissing the state government altogether. But the bjp party takes its case to the president. 
>> It was very unusual. Up to now, nothing of this sort has happened in indian parliament. 
>> In the end, the president supports the bjp party and gives the power back to it. 
>> In technical terms, bjp and its allies emerged winners. 
>> Since 1997 violent outbursts in the state assembly have become rare, perhaps in part due to some redecorating. 
>> Mikes and rods were removed. Paperweights were removed. Anything which can be thrown was not allowed on the desk. 
>>> Now take a look at what happened at a somali political summit in 2005. 

[00:38:47]


>> It confirmed all of our worst fears about the transitional parliament and the transitional federal government, that this was an utterly dysfunctional group. 
>> The fight starts when somali politicians disagree about allowing peacekeeping troops into their troubled country. 
>> The ultimate irony of this one was this was a fight about peacekeepers. 
>> Somali is the longest-running instance of police state collapse of the post-colonial era. Of state collapse of the post-colonial era. 
>> The somali people have gone without a functional government since 1991, and many aren't willing to let peacekeepers try to stabilize the situation. 
>> Somali has a bad history with international peacekeeping. The u.N. Operation in somali in 1993 through '95 led to the blackhawk down disaster in which 18 army rangers lost their lives and many hundreds of somalis as well. So there's a history to international peacekeeping in somalia, which makes them leery of it. 
>> On top of it, somalia's hotly contested transitional governnt has only just been formed. 
>> A parliament is not a routine thing in somalia. That's part of the problem. This is a country that had 20 years of dictatorship from the 1970s AND 1980s AND HAD NO REAL Culture of parliamentary debate and dialogue and then 20 years of state collapse. So we're really dealing with somali political figures that have no history, no culture of the give and take of parliamentary debate. 
>> There's a guy in this one just wailing on somebody with a cane, intending to do some real harm. 
>> I've seen more effective fighting in other places. This was really haphazard, but it was quite dangerous because of the way they were using chairs and sticks. I mean, someone could have gotten killed. 
>> Peacekeepers are eventually allowed into somalia in 2007. And as a result, fighting among somali insurgents increases. 
>> We've got a very serious political crisis on our hands, and it has triggered the worst humanitarian crisis in the world. 3.8 million somalis are in immediate need of humanitarian assistance. 1.8 million are internally displaced because of the fighting. U.N. Considers somalia the worst humanitarian crisis in the world. 

[00:40:55]


>> Sadly, this scene from 2005 mirrors on a much smaller scale the struggle that occurs every day in somalia. The short-term future of the country is very, very troubled. We're not going to see the fighting go away any time soon. In the long term I have confidence that the somali people will pull themselves together. I think the somalis will have an interest in seeing a revived state and a consolidated peace. 
>>> Coming up -- one political brawl gets really out of hand. 
>> Somebody is saying that he was dead. 
>> Nothing is under control. Just violence. Just rage. 
>>> And then the political bloopers you just can't get enough of. 
>> One of the most embarrassing moments for any politician I've seen. 
>> When "caught on

>> I think when it ends in a coma, something needs to be done. This shouldn't happen anymore. 
>> The bolivian congress has seen a lot of action in the past several years. 
>> Bolivian politics is one of the most conflicted, aggressive in the world. 
>> In fact, bolivia only became A DEMOCRACY IN THE '80s AFTER Years of military rule, and then a string of governments, infamous for human rights abuses, narcotics trafficking, and economic corruption. But some say the word "democracy" should be used lightly when it comes to bolivia. 

[00:46:08]


>> What this violent fights say about the political system in bolivia, it's a system of failure. Violence, it's the consequence of the lack of real democracy. We have elections. We have a congress. We have democratic representatives that have been elected. But somehow all of the problems that are in bolivian society have been arosen in a violent way. It becomes scary. Nothing's under control. Just violence. Just rage. 
>> One famous instance of violent rage happens in september 2006. 
>> It was really, really a terrible fight. It was really, really a tense situation. 
>> Jose is a former member of the minority party in bolivia. He's there that evening. 
>> That night I remember the president in the assembly was leading the session. 
>> He calls for all constitutional reforms to be passed by a simple majority. Jose's party reacts angrily knowing they will have no say in these reforms. 
>> I recall that we took to the session small plastic bottles, and we started hitting the bottles and making noise, and yelling dictatorship, dictatorship, so that they could stop the session. 
>> Words are not enough to stop the proceedings. 
>> You see people standing on the desk, yelling at each other, women throwing paper. And, of course, men fighting with their hands, you know, punching each other. Like it was a ring. 
>> As jose and his party are doing battle on the floor, a man named roman, a prominent member of the ruling party, loses his footing and falls from a ledge. 

[00:48:19]


>> Suddenly he slipped and fell. He was lying down, and his head was bleeding. And somebody screamed, saying that he was dead. 
>> He is rushed to the hospital. His life hanging in the balance. 
>> People started crying. Women started yelling. And some of the female members of the government started attacking us, accusing us, saying that we pushed roman loiza. 
>> People that belongs to the government said it was on purpose. And a terrle fight also started. 
>> You can see jose in the middle of the melee being beaten from behind. 
>> That night was like a nightmare. All our fears started becoming true. We were attacked. We were hit. I felt a couple of punches on my head from the back. I almost fainted. 
>> Scared for his life, jose and the rest of the opposition party flee. 
>> We managed to get out of the theater and run away, literally run away. 
>> Jose runs home and remains there for several hours until he gets a startling phone call, warning him that angry members of roman loiza's party are after him. 
>> So I decided to move to another place and then take us immediately at night and move to another city to stay safe. 
>> The lives of jose and other members of his party depend on roman's full recovery. They remain in hiding waiting for news of his condition. 
>> He was in a coma for quite a few days. We would have ended up being lynched if mr. Loisa had not recovered. 
>> Two months later, he recovers and returns to the assembly. 

[00:50:20]


>> He came back as a different persov. He was not man of confrontation anymore. He summoned us for a reconciliation, and he provoked one of the most touchy, sensitive moments of the constitutional assembly. We applauded him, we thanked him, and we held each other, members of the opposition and members of the government. Some people even cried. 
>> The incident with mr. Loisa gave them a chance to talk, it gave them a chance to see each other as what they really are, human beings. 
>>> Coming up, politicians step out and get down.

>>> Going wild seems to be an ongoing theme in the political arena. But fighting isn't the only thing caught on camera. Sometimes they trade wild for just plain embarrassing. 
>> There's a rule for politicians that even if the camera is not on them, if there's a camera in the room, always assume you're on the air. 
>> Take the mayor of london, boris johnson, for instance. Encouraging volunteers to help clean up london's rivers, boris sets the example and takes the plunge, literally. 
>> I'm here to promote volunteering week. What could be more lovely on a day like this than having a quick informal dip. 
>> Informal? That's one word for it.

>> I hope your campaign platform is more solid than your footing. That goes for you too, mr. Dole. Campaigning against president bill clinton turns out to be a dangerous affair for bob dole. Reaching out to his supporters in california, he falls head first off stage. It turns out that the presidency is just beyond his reach. And speaking of feet, waiting around for dignitaries can be tedious work. President bush takes the opportunity to entertain the press with some fancy footwork of his own. 
>> I don't know of any times when it's really good for a president to try to dance. 
>> President bush, it seems, disagrees. Here he is again in africa. 
>> And secretary of state hillary clinton gets down in kenya. 
>> Thank you very much. Stop the music. 
>> Even russian president boris yeltsin seems comfortable on the dance floor. 
>> Kick it. 
>> Not all politicians are quite so musically inclined however. Just ask karl rove. ?????? Tell me what is your name ?????? ?????? emcee rove ?????? 
>> I saw this one live, I'm afraid. It was even scarier to watch karl rove rapping in person than on the tv. He's got some of the movements that only dick cheney could manage. 
>> Emcee rove. ?????? It's fun it to come to the rnc ?????? 
>> colin powell is equally musically challenged. Here he is singing at a security meeting in indonesia. And bad boy blagojevich is caught on camera taking on elvis. ???????????? 

[00:57:53]


>> yikes. Don't quit your day jobs, fellows. Oh, wait, never mind. Perhaps they should have made a speedy escape like president bush tried to do after this press conference. 
>> This was one of the famous episodes with george bush looking like he didn't know what he was doing because he didn't even know where the door was. 
>> I was trying to escape. 
>> And talk about wanting to escape, who can forget vice president dan quayle exercising his spelling expertise in front of the camfras. 
>> Add one little bit on the end. Potato. 
>> You write phonetically. There you go. 
>> There you go. 
>> I wouldn't try your luck at, are you smarter than a fifth grader, dan. 
>> I guess he was wrong and i was right. 
>> And speaking of a gaffe with an "e" on the ere's a technical one. And you're in my way of my script, there, if you will move. 
>> And don't you just hate those meetings that go on and on and on? President ronald reagan certainly did. Just before leaving office, president reagan jokes about his frequent public snoozes. As soon as I get home to california, I plan to lean back, kick up my feet, and take a long nap. Come to think of it, things won't be all that different after all. 
>> And speaking of snoozing, i bet president bill clinton wishes this baby was napping and hadn't just eaten before he picked her up at a rally. 
>> Threw up a little bit. 
>> That's good luck.

=======================================================

>>> A kid coming home from the dentist. 
>> Is this real life? 
>> A piano-playing cat. 
>> I'm like, oh, my god. Oh, my god. Look at this. 
>> Artwork made with ketchup and fries? 
>> I couldn't believe that it was real. 
>> They are videos so original, so funny, so bizarre, you just have to pass them on. They're viewed by millions. 
>> Owwww! 
>> What's their secret formula? ???????????? "caught on camera: Viral videos 
- millions served." 
>> Hello. I'm contessa brewer. Welcome to "caught on camera." Have your friends ever e-mailed you a video that's so funny, so unique, or so completely absurd that you felt like you have to send it to everyone you know? If you've pressed "send," you've had a hand in spreading a viral video. It's not big budgets or great production values that make these videos so compelling. In this hour you'll see some of the most watched viral videos. Each video has more than a million hits online. But why? You be the judge. Ketchup and fries make a great snack, but can they make a work of art? Using about ten packets of ketchup and a carton of fries, artist jason baalman proves, well, yes, they can. 
>> When I first saw it, i watched it a few times. I couldn't believe that it was real. 
>> It was very impressive and edible. 
>> In march 2007 jason posed a time-lapsed video on youtube, which shows him using french fries and ketchup to paint a PICTURE of McDonald's icon ronald McDonald and "super size me" filmmaker morgan spurlock. 
>> This guy basically takes bags of McDonald's fast food ketchup and makes art with french fry and ketchup. It's incredible. 

[00:02:05]


>> Within a week, the video receives more than 1 million hits. 
>> It was quite shocking. I knew that there were such things as viral videos, but never in my intentions did i think I was ever going to create one. Never even thought of that. I was just playing around. 
>> But why use ketchup and french fries to paint a picture. As a portrait artist, jason grew tired of drawing with charcoal and pencil. He looked everywhere for inspiration, and one night he found it -- in his happyeal. 
>> I came across it by accident, eating some french fries, and saw that I could manipulate the ketchup with the french fry, and it could be like a brush. 
>> Jason wanted to paint something that related to the tools that he was using, so he decided to paint his own version of the movie poster for "super size me." 
>> It related to the ketchup. It gave somewhat of a meaning and interpretation to it. 
>> With a small web camera recording, jason prepares his ketchup, picks up a fry, and begins painting. 
>> McDONALD'S FRENCH FRIES AS A Paintbrush. It's unbelievable. 
>> Ketchup may work as a condiment, but it proves tricky as paint. 
>> Unlike paint, the ketchup was a matter of how thick it was on there. So if there was a very thin layer of ketchup, it showed up as a light color because the background showed through. If it was piled on there thick, it was the darkest red. So it was more of sculpting the actual height that the ketchup stood out on the page. 
>> Working with flimsy french fries also becomes problematic. 
>> Well, I was constantly having to change the french fries and find ones that maybe had a point, or actually at the end i found like the soggy ones performed differently. It was like having a variety of brushes, but never knew what i was going to get. 
>> Yet despite jason's unique challenges, a very realistic DEPICTION OF ronald McDonald begins to emerge. 
>> It's interesting to see the building of it because it really can help kind of go, oh, wow, that's how you do that? 
>> The french fry brush dances across the paper, and suddenly the image of morgan spurlock comes to life with true artist precision. Jason finishes the painting in one take in less than an hour. 

[00:04:15]


>> He's obviously a true artist, but rather than just do portraits like everybody else, he's done something really different. He's used a different medium. I think it's really cool. 
>> Since its original posting in 2007, jason's ketchup art has had great success, earning more than 3 million hits. 
>> Anytime somebody has an extraordinary talent like that, it seems to do really well on the internet. Add to the fact that they use a time-lapsed camera, people love to watch things in time-lapsed cameras. 
>> Some people even go so far as they will get ketchup and french fries and try it. 
>> Jason's passion for creating unusual works of art doesn't stop with ketchup and fries. There's the cheetos elvis using crumbled cheetos, the lipstick angelina jolie drawn with various shades of lipstick, and the bette davis mascara painting drawn completely with mascara. But his most famous work comes shortly after he finishes ketchup art. It's a time-lapsed version of the mona lisa using microsoft paint. 
>> Most people that have used windows have tried microsoft paint. It's the paint program included. It's usually good enough to draw a stick figure, and that's the extent of it. 
>> Jason says he wanted to create fine art while using a simple consumer program like microsoft paint. 
>> The idea I had was to take something that people had experien with and put it with another thing, which was the mona lisa. It was two things that they could relate to and give it a value of its own. 
>> Despite the limitations of microsoft paint, jason finds ways to add depth to his painting. 
>> I was using a drawing tablet, so that made it a lot easier, but I used a variety of the tools, and a lot of it is kind of an optical illusion. 
>> Within about an hour and a half, jasonishes his painting, and since posting, jason's rendition of the mona lisa has gone viral with more than 11 million hits. Jason says he hopes to continue to use the internet as a medium to showcase his work. 

[00:06:17]


>> The internet expands people's horizons, and it opens up the world to their self-expression. Their art's probably getting seen more on youtube even if it's not making millions. It's getting thousands of views than it would be sitting in the gallery. 
>>> Another artist that brings something unique to the internet is noah calina. He takes a picture of himself every day for over six years. 
>> You get to watch this guy basically grow. 
>> This is an amazing video. It's hard to find a video on the internet that has to wow factory. This is definitely one of those. 
>> Some people keep scrapbooks, others right in journals. BUT ON JANUARY 11th, 2000, NOAH Gins his project. "Noah k. Every day," an experimental photography project that captures the passage of time. With the flip screen of his digital camera, noah's able to see the image while photographing. He lines up his nose in the center of the screen and snaps. In the beginning he doesn't think it will be possible to photograph himself every single day. But soon it becomes as normal as brushing his teeth. Six years and 2,356 photos later, noah compiles his still photography experiment into a 5-1/2-minute time-lapsed video, and in august 2006 posts it on youtube. 
>> This blew up when this first came out. It was like mind-exploding. 
>> Viewers watched more than a half a decade of noah's life unfold, his apartments, his hairstyles, even his girlfriends. 
>> In some ways it's a very personal video, where it's like this is me, just completely exposed, and people start to really get into that. 
>> In three weeks the video shoots to one million hits. 
>> Every once in a while you get that one where he's like, whoop, on vacation, or like, weird night vision. 
>> You just find little things every time you watch it. You see little people in the background sometimes, and he's switching rooms, and his style has sort of changed, and he's got some facial hair. It's really a day in a life. 

[00:08:23]


>> And though noah never smiles, there's something about his stare that's completely mesmerizing. 
>> It's really creepy. It's like this guy's staring into my soul. 
>> But viewers seem to love it because noah's video has earned more than 13 million hits and counting. 
>> People are really interested in the passage of time, to watch somebody's face and hair and style change over six years every single day. It's really interesting. You know, I could watch this over and over again. 
>> Noah's "noah k. Every day" photography project is still a work in progress. Since he started back in january 2000, noah has only missed 22 photos. According to his website, noah plans to release a new "noah k. Every day" on the video's ten-year anniversary, and he hopes to continue photographing himself every day for the rest of his life. 
>>> Coming up -- a bride can't stop laughing during her wedding vows. 
>> Oh, gosh. Here she goes again. 
>>> And a little boy can't remove his finger from his baby brother's mouth. 
>> Ow. Ouch, charlie.

>>> Most people are nervous on their wedding day, but while reciting his vows in august 2009, 25-year-old groom andrew engstrom has a slip of the tongue. 
>> I, andrew paul daniel engstrom -- 
>> do take melissa rene warren -- 
>> do take melissa rene warren. 
>> -- To be my lawfully wedded wife. 
>> To be my waf -- lawfully -- 
>> the church erupts in laughter, including the 22-year-old bride, melissa warren. And just as things start to quiet down, she completely loses it. 
>> I just lost it. It was so funny. 
>> She starts to laugh, and then she just can't stop laughing. I know she's going to keep laughing. So I'm like, just give her a minute, folks. Like I know the next one's coming. 
>> When the video hits the internet, it earns more than a million hits. 
>> Melissa and andrew first met at seattle pacific university where they were both students. 
>> We lived in the same residents halls. I was a freshman. He was a junior. And we had a lot of mutual friends. Spent some time together within groups, but it was after he graduated that we connected again. 
>> After graduating, andrew received some devastating news. 
>> My dad came down with lung cancer, like horrific tumors the size of grapefruits. 
>> Deeply religious, andrew copes with his father's cancer with prayer, and the first person he reaches out to is melissa. 
>> It just felt as natural as could be to go to melissa about it. Even though we didn't know each other really well, I knew her in a way that I trusted her a lot. 
>> He e-mailed me and said will you pray because I don't want my dad to die. And it was to the point where they weren't going to treat him. So we all started praying. 
>> Call it divine intervention or simply good luck, but after one month of prayer from andrew, melissa, family, and friends, andrew's father defies the odds. His tumors completely disappear. 
>> He started getting better. His pain started going away. 

[00:14:43]


>> And when andrew returns to seattle pacific to interview for a master's program, he has more on his mind than impressing the faculty. He wants to see melissa, who's a junior at the school. 
>> I was hoping I'd get an audience with her. Sure enough that night she was there. 
>> We just had this wonderful time with our community, and then after that point, we both kind of knew something's going on here. 
>> After a whirlwind courtship, dating, and engagement, andrew and melissa are finally ready to tie the knot, and as the day of the wedding arrives, everyone is eager to begin the ceremony. 
>> I was stressed. I was feeling really kind of uptight, and I just had this moment of like I don't want to feel like this on my wedding day, and I asked god for joy. 
>> And joy she gets. As melissa and her father walk down the aisle, things just keep getting funnier and funnier from the organist who won't stop playing -- 
>> I was like, okay, come on, organ lady, this is my wedding day. 
>> -- To melissa's dad telling their love story. 
>> Oh, thank you. 
>> We were just laughing through the whole thing and crying. 
>> Things become downright comical. But by the time melissa and andrew get to their vows, the mood turns serious. 
>> Both of us have prepared for a long time for our spouse and saved ourselves for marriage, and so it was like, woe, I'm giving you my life, even only part of the way. You can see that gravity. 
>> Melissa and andrew's dads, who are both pastors, serve as officiants, and andrew's dad has the honor of giving the vows. When melissa recites her part, she gets choked up. 
>> Until death do us part. 
>> Until death do us part. 
>> This is my solemn vow. 
>> This is my solemn vow. 
>> Now it's andrew's turn. 
>> You can see how intense I am. 
>> I, andrew paul daniel engstrom, do take melissa rene warren -- 
>> do take melissa rene warren 
>> -- to be my lawfully wedded wife. 
>> To be my waf -- lawfully wedded wife. And pancake-y. I caught myself at waf, you know. It wasn't like waffling. But it was too late. And her dad loved to giggle. And then she starts laughing. It's like all right. You know, that's cool. I'm all right with that. 

[00:16:59]


>> It just sort of hit my funnybone. 
>> She started laughing. I've learned enough about her by now to know that was not the end of it. 
>> To the amusement of everyone in the church that melissa finds it so funny that she belts out a screeching laugh. 
>> Every time I looked at andrew after I first started laughing, I would remember what he just said and the fact that we're standing in front of 400 people saying our vows and couldn't stop laughing. It was so funny. 
>> And she keeps on laughing. 
>> And then dad starts all the way over. 
>> I, andrew paul daniel engstrom -- 
>> I'm like, if you're ever going to give me a chance to mess up again, it's if you start all the way over. I'm not feeling that sure right now. 
>> To quiet the laughter and move things along, andrew quotes one of his favorite lines from the movie "the princess bride." 
>> Say, "man and wife." 
>> That's when I said, "say, 'man and wife'" because I wanted him to get things speeded up. 
>> And his tactic works because shortly after the laughter dies down, andrew and melissa are presented to the world as husband and wife. Andrew's slip-up is so funny they tell their wedding videographer to post it on the web. 
>> We were thinking, you know, it will be for our friends, and people will watch it. And then it started picking up speed really unexpectedly. 
>> It gets so many hits that melissa's and andrew's parents contact them on their honeymoon. 
>> We got calls from our parents on our honeymoon. You've got to get to a library and watch your wedding video, which was silly because we were on our honeymoon. 
>> And when they finally returned home, the hits continue to climb. 
>> It's like 80,000. It's crazy, you know. So it's clearly not just our friends watching it, which is what we expected. 
>> The popularity of the video is catching, and eventually it reaches more than 1 million hits. 
>> The fact that she cannot stop laughing and she can't pull herself together makes it viral magic. 
>> Andrew blames his slight of tongue on a term called "spoonerism." 
>> My dad does it on purpose. So it's actually his fault. He trained me to do this. He switches the first two letters of the word, so like "sleeping bag" would be "beeping slag." A "cup of water" would be a "wup of cotter." 

[00:19:10]


>> But despite his spooners, andrew hopes his wedding day gaffe will be a sign of how he and melissa will handle whatever hardship comes their way, with love and with a lot of laughter. 
>>> Coming up -- one of the hottest acts on the web -- 
>> hey, it's fred. 
>> -- Features one of the craziest characters you've ever seen. 
>>> Plus, a little boy's trip to the dentist -- 
>> do I have stitcs? 
>> Yes. 
>> On my teeth? 
>> Yeah. Don't touch it. 
>> -- Leaves viewers in stitches. 
>> Don't. 
>>> And a baby's bite goes viral. 
>> Ow. Ouch, charlie.

[00:22:48]


>>> Hey, it's fred. 
>> Wait! Rewind. Who is that? 
>> Hey, it's fred. 
>> Who or what is fred? 
>> Fred is -- I think he might be the number one subscribed channel on youtube or close to it. 
>> Close to it is right. Previously in first place, the fred channel moved to the second most subscribed channel on youtube in 2009 with more than one million subscribers. 
>> Oh, my god! 
>> Fred is sort of an internet phenomenon. 
>> But with a following that size, who are the brains behind the operation? Comedy sketch group in new york? 
>> Oh, yeah, yeah. 
>> A major entertainment company in hollywood? 
>> Uh, no. 
>> How about a teenager in rural nebraska? 
>> Oh, my god! It's cold! 
>> If you guessed the teen, you're right. Fred is the brainchild of a 16-year-old boy named lucas cruikshank. The fourth of eight kids, lucas has been coming up with funny characters as long as he can remember. 
>> I was always like making random characters and sketch videos with my family with my mom's camera. 
>> But after receiving a camera of his own at 13, lucas unknowingly took his sketch comedy videos over to a whole new level. 
>> Like I had two cousins over, and we started making just a bunch of random videos and posting them online, thinking nothing of it. I like to understand that people from all over the entire world can watch the videos. 
>> In october 2006 one of his videos featured a new fictional character, a hyperactive 6-year-old with a high-pitched voice named fred. Lucas shoots, stars, and edits the video, and films it -- where else -- at his house. 
>> Fred is a 6-year-old, and he's really random and crazy. His mom is an alcoholic. 
>> My mom's in rehab because of her problems. 
>> And his dad's in prison. He's never even met his dad. 
>> Fred, unlike lucas, is so socially awkward that he has no friends, and with his shrill voice, he rambles on and on into the camera. 
>> Whatever. 
>> When he's just in front of the camera, he's just all confident, and he'll say anything. When he's actually like out with other kids, then he's like this awkward person, and he does like weird stuff that kids just like look at, and they're just like i don't want to be friends with someone who does that, you know. 

[00:24:56]


>> In fred's world, there are plenty of people to impress. You never see them, but you hear them. Lucas voices them all. 
>> Don't take off any of your clothes in front of that camera unless someone pays you. 
>> Besides fred's alcoholic mother and absentee dad, there's fred's crush, judy. 
>> This is getting kind of stalkerish. Oh, my god. 
>> No, no, judy. You can't come in. Nooooo! 
>> There's fred's arch nemesis and judy's pseudo boyfriend kevin. 
>> Let's go beat up fred inside the pool. 
>> No. Do you want me to get the cat with rabies to bite you again? 
>> And then there's fred's trusty cat with rabies. And then there's a few kind neighborhood squirrels played by dogs. 
>> There's obviously the animals who are kind of fred's friends 
-- only friends. 
>> Oh, I knew you would always be on my side. 
>> In each roughly 2 1/2-minute video, lucas's character fred deals with ordinary situations in the only way he knows how, by acting completely crazy. Take a look at this video. Fred goes swimming. One of lucas's most popular, with more than 34 million hits. 
>> Basically it's fred talking about this new big pool that he's received and then swimming in this pool that ends up not being as big as he at first said it would be. Then he gets attacked by some sort of plastic shark. It's all very specific, yet out there. 
>> Very silly, total slapstick humor, the kind of thing that my 4-year-old son finds hysterical. 
>> And then there's one of lucas's favorite videos, fred stalks judy." 
>> That was so much fun to film because there's like a little photo shoot, and that was so funny to see fred do, like him trying to look cool. 
>> How does lucas create fred's signature voice? 
>> Fred's voice you could either do with like helium, which probably isn't safe to do. I speed up the video so it sounds more crazy and looks more crazy. I just thought it added a whole new element to the character. 
>> When lucas first realizes his little household hobby is being viewed by millions of people, he becomes a little anxious. 
>> It like really freaked me out. I felt all pressure to think of ideas. And when I'd film, I was like all nervous. 
>> But the nerves don't last long, and lucas's fred videos continue to be wildly successful with their primary audience, tweens and teens. 

[00:27:01]


>> He'd just talk about texting and internet-y stuff, and i think it just really appeals to the younger generation. 
>> Lucas's videos are so popular, that soon this teenage entrepreneur is approached by a licensing agent, and now fred dolls, shirts, and bags are being sold all over the country. 
>> It's so weird like walking into a store and seeing dolls made out of you. It's really weird. 
>> But just how successful is lucas? Well, his "fred" videos have earned him enough money to go to college, but his mom says despite his fame, he's still lucas at home, a teenager who does his chores and picks up his younger siblings from school. Besides staying tuned for the next season of "fred," fans can also look forward to the upcoming "fred" movie. 
>> The "fred" movie's going to be kind of different from the videos in a way that it's not just not going to be fred the whole entire time, and you'll see all the other characters. And won't be playing. There'll actually be other actors playing the other characters. 
>> And if you're older than 18 and scratching your head because you just don't get fred, maybe you're not supposed to. 
>> It depends what kind of comedies you like. Some think it stupid. Some think it's awesome. I don't think about the audience. I think about the videos. 
>> Thank you. Thank you very much. 
>>> Coming up -- 
>> I feel -- 
>> a little boy's trip to the dentist has millions with their mouths open wide. 
>> Is this going to be forever? 
>>> And is that cat really playing the piano. 
>> She's doing two paws at a time. It's amazing.

[00:30:28]


[ Male Announcer ] CAMPBELL'S CHUNKY SOUP. It fills you up right. 
>>> I'm milissa rehberger. Here's what's happening. Connect cut police say they've seen an increase in gun permit applications since the newtown school shooting. Residents in newtown are gathering today to talk about whether to tear down the school where a gunman killed 26 people and whether to replace wit a memorial. And in australia, extreme heat and raging wildfires have kicked up massive dust storms which blocked out the sun. More than 130 fires are burning across australia rht now. Back to "caught on camera." 
>>> Welcome back to "caught on camera." I'm contessa brewer. It's one of those moments we dread, going to the dentist. That maybe why this next video resonates with so many people. Millions of clicks made a little boy with a toothache a bite-size celebrity. WHEN david DeVore buckles his son into his car seat on the way back from the dentist, he notices his 7-year-old son is acting pretty strange. 

[00:32:42]


>> Is this real life? 
>> He was just being very crazy acting. He was very loopy, kind of sliding down the seat and just seeing double and that sort of thing. 
>> That morning in may 2008 david junior had surgery to remove an extra tooth, and apparently the anesthesia had not yet worn off. 
>> I'm hungry. 
>> Yeah, I know. How did it go? 
>> I didn't feel anything. 
>> Yeah. It was pretty invasive surgery, so he had a strong sedative. 
>> With david junior strapped securely in his seat, his father decides to document the moment. He pools out his camera and begins taping in the parking lot. 
>> The original intent of the video was to record it because my wife couldn't be there. I just wanted to tape it to show her. 
>> David junior is extremely confused. So his father tries to reassure him. 
>> You have four eyes. 
>> My main goal was to calm him down. 
>> Do you feel good? 
>> And to not make him more agitated. So I was trying, you know, with my voice -- 
>> now I have two fingers. 
>> Good. 
>> Oh. Four fingers. 
>> Four fingers? 
>> But david is completely out of it, and like most curious kids, his finger goes straight for his stitches. 
>> Nah, nah, nah, don't put it -- don't put it in your mouth. 
>> Head bobbing, david is disoriented. 
>> Do you feel good? 
>> But tries to cope. 
>> I can't see anything. 
>> Yes, you can. Stay in your seat. 
[ Screaming ] 
>> I think he was just trying to wake himself up, you know, to see if it was real. 
>> But those little hands keep going for the stitches. 
>> Do I have stitches? 
>> Uh-huh. 
>> Do I have stitches? 
>> Yes. 
>> On my teeth? 

[00:34:42]


>> Yeah. Don't touch it. 
>> Do I have stitches? Don't put your finger in your mouth. 
>> Don't. 
>> Don't. Don't do it. Damnit. I want nothing more than to put my fingers in my mouth right now. 
>> Why can't I touch it? 
>> Because it will mess up the stitches. 
>> But when david can't shake his crazy nightmare, he becomes upset. 
>> I feel funny. Why is this happening to me? 
>> It's okay, bud. It's just from the medicine, okay? 
>> Is this going to be forever? 
>> No. No, it won't be forever. 
>> There's something about the sort of honesty of seeing a kid go through this process that most of us have experienced. We've all, you know, had some sort of medical procedure where you had to wake up from anesthesia and you're completely blown out of your mind. You don't even know what's going on. 
>> When david senior and his family watch the video, they love it so much that a few ater they post it on facebook. 
>> I got into facebook and posted it and just got some good reaction from our family and friends and started to get more and more requests to see it. 
>> So david senior decides to put the video of his son on youtube, and in just one week the video receives a jaw-dropping 3 million hits. 
>> You know, you're just shocked, you know. Not negative or positive, right? But you're just like, wow, so many people are reviewing it. 
>> And though some viewers love "david after dentist," others see it as poor taste. 
>> I feel funny. 
>> David senior and his family are invited to appear on the "today" show to discuss the video and the controversy surrounding it. 
>> Some people say, okay, this is funny, david and tessy. And others say, no, this is exploitation. In fact, a writer of the "sun times" says videos of kids on drugs cross the line. Officials should be concerned. We expect parents to protect their children in situations where they cannot protect themselves, not exploit them. How do you feel about that? 

[00:36:49]


>> Well, we certainly understand the reaction, that point of view, and as dedicated parents, we actually appreciate that. But this is an isolated incident. This was something that our family, you know, thought was okay. Should I have posted it? Why did I videotape it? You know, as a parent i understand because it is, you know, a chil and if we thought there was anything that was harming david or putting him in harm's way, we wouldn't do it. 
>> But despite some criticism, there have been some positive results. David senior has started a "david after dentist" t-shirt line, using those now famous quotes from his son. 
>> We have a graphic t-shirt with a picture of david and that quote. 
>> And what does the star of the video think of all this? 
>> I take pictures with everybody that recognizes me. 
>> His favorite part of the video? Not surprising to me, the part where he screams. 
[ Screaming ] 
>> of course, david junior doesn't remember much about his dentist visit. 
>> I remember my dad and this other lady carrying me out. I could barely see. My eyes were barely open. I was like dizzy. 
>> Whether david loves the video or wishes it would just go away, it's one soon he won't live down. 
>> Is this going to be forever? 
>> On youtube, you bet it will. 
>> I think this video is like this generations, you know, naked baby pictures. 
>> Why is this happening to me? 
>> But I don't think he'll be embarrassed by one. I don't think he will. I think he'll enjoy it for a long time. 
>>> Halfway around the world two more kids hold the title for one of the most watched viral videos of all times. 
>> Charlie bit me. 
>> This is one of my favorite viral videos of the last two years. Easily. 
>> Spring 2007, england. Howard, who prefers we don't use his last name, films his two young sons as they watch tv. 

[00:38:55]


>> I tend to get the camera out every now and then. I'll just take videos of them just doing what they do as children. 3 1/2-year-old harry is holding his 1-year-old brother charlie on his lap. 
>> Charlie is just sitting on harry's lap, and for some reason harry puts his finger near his mouth. 
>> Using no force at all charlie pretends to bite harry's finger. Thinking it's funny he sticks his finger in his mouth again. 
>> And all of a sudden charlie decides to clamp down and bite it. 
>> Ow. Charlie, that really hurt. 
>> Just the reaction is sort of like the pause. 
>> Ow. 
>> And charlie bit me, ouch. 
>> Ow, charlie. 
>> Ouch, charlie. 
>> It's just classic. 
>> He bit me really, really, really, really hard. 
>> So his little brother is gnawing on his finger, and harry never makes a move to make him stop. 
>> It's very brave of harry not to retaliate. He didn't try to rip his finger out. He didn't hurt charlie. He took it and realized that charlie really wasn't trying to hurt him. 
>> But charlie must have sensed his brother wasn't happy because he quickly opens his mouth and lets go. 
>> That really hurts. 
>> And that's when charlie starts laughing. 
>> All of a sudden the baby just goes -- like out of nowhere the kid is full on maniacal laugh about biting the kid's finger. 
>> I can object assume he found it funny because I was finding it funny or the whole experience made him laugh. 
>> Howard, the first to witness what millions would come to see and love shows the video to his wife when she came home. 
>> I thought it was funny. We put it on our digital photo frame for a few weeks and we showed it to friends and family when they visited. 
>> But howard wants to show the video to a few friends in the states, including the boys' godfather. His friends suggest uploading it to the internet. At first the video only receives a few hundred hits, but within a few months it begins to double almost daily, and howard's video soars off the charts when it reaches a million hits in 2007. 

[00:41:09]


>> We just can't imagine that kind of thing happening. 
>> And it's become a whopper. Since its original posting, the video of a moment between his two sons sitting on their living room chair has earned more than 130 million hits. 
>> When millions of people start watching, there's something you can't really comprehend. I think it's so popular because it appeals to everybody. 
>> There's an innocence about it I think that people can really relate to, and I think there's a realness to it that everybody loves. Plus, it's funny, let's face it. 
>> It's become so popular there are several spoofs. 
>> Ouch, charlie, ouch, ouch. 
>> Harry and charlie may have one of the top viral videos of all time, but they'd better watch out for a new young star. In 2008 baby brother jasper joined the family, and he's already proving toe quite the biter. 
>> Jasper seems to have taken onboard as well, and jaspew enjoys going around and biting people's fingers. 
>>> Coming up -- have you ever wondered how to do the moon walk? 
>> Certain things aren't that hard if you know how to do that. 
>> That and cat on the keyboard. 
>> She brings up her left paw and begins playing with the other paw. I think that's remarkable.

>> I don't know when the cat party got elected, but the internet has embraced cats like nothing I've ever seen. 
>> It all begins in 2004. It begins when artist betsy alexander and her husband go to petsmart to buy food. 
>> There was an animal shelter where we shop for cat food. All the cats were out playing, and nora was playing by herself. She was a kitten, and i immediately fell in love with her. 
>> Betsy got very excited about her, wanted me to come see her, come and hold her, and I was very resistant to doing that. 
>> Burnell doesn't want to add another cat to the family.

[00:55:22]

>> Burnell and I were upstairs, and we heard this plink, plink, plink, plink. Repeated notes like two together. 
>> To their shocking delight, nora's playing.

>> We totally lost it. We were like, oh, my god, oh, my god. Look at this. Nora, what are you doing? 
>> Betsy believes this is just an isolated incident, but for nora, this is just the beginning. 

[00:57:23]


>> She started playing every day and started doing it during the piano students' lessons. 
>> Nora becomes a neighborhood hit. Betsy also wants to show the performances to her niece in wyoming. Some of her students suggest youtube.

>> Nora's videos are so popular they come to the attention of a lithuanian composer. 
>> He created music programs for the chamber orchestra in lithuania for children. He wanted to do an orchestra piece that is based on nora's playing the riffs that she plays. 
>> And thus the catcerto is born. 
>> I think this is the first time that a concerto has been written for an animal. I think it only exists because of the internet. 
>> When posted on the internet, the catcerto receives more than 1 million hits, and in october 2009, norah wins an aspca award for cat of the year. 
>> What an honor. 
>> In this dog eat dog world, it's nice to see a cat succeed.

>>> Scenarios that force you to ask yourself, what would you do? 
>> Hello. Welcome to "caught on camera" I'm contessa brewer. How well do you know yourself. We catch people in situations that are dangerous, life threatening, some ethical, uncomfortable. Briefly put yourself in the place of the people in these stories and ask yourself did they make the right choice and what would you decide? 

[00:02:08]


>> A car with its hazards on runs a red light and pulls into this parking lot with police in hot pursuit. The driver is nfl running back brian moats. Earlier that evening, his wife gets an urgent phone call from a nurse teing them to come to the hospital. Tam isha's mother, sick with cancer, is very close to death. 
>> Get in there. Get in there. Let me see your hands. 
>> Excuse me. My mom -- 
>> get in there. Put your hands on the car. 
>> His mom is dying. 
>> Officer robert powell gets out of his car, gun drawn, as she tries to explain. 
>> His mom is dying. 
>> Do you understand? 
>> As I turned around, he has a gun pointed at me. And just a cold look in his eyes. Letting me know, I don't care. 
>> Mom is dying -- 
>> do you understand? 
>> I was walking toward a cop, a hostile cop, with a gun. 
>> What would you do in this situation? Disobey a policeman with his gun drawn, or stay and miss the only opportunity you'll have to say good-bye to your dying mother? For tamisha, the decision is an easy one. 
>> Get over here. 
>> Along with her great aunt, she heads into the hospital. 
>> I know a lot of people think that what I did was crazy or dangerous, but the truth of the matter is there is nothing in the world that would have kept me from going up at the time that I did. 
>> Get over here. 
>> Brian's faced with a decision, too. Should he disobey the officer? Should he go into the hospital like his wife? Officer powell hasn't responded to reason yet, and moats feels he's running out of time. 
>> You ran a red light. 
>> My mother is dying. Right now. Right now. 
>> That doesn't constitute a red light. 
>> >> I waited until no traffic was coming. I got seconds before she's gone, man. Let me see your insurance for the car. 

[00:04:12]


>> Moats does provide his insurance to the officer, but the situation quickly escalates from there. 
>> Are you having a problem? 
>> We don't have a problem. My mother-in-law is dying. I don't understand why you can't understand that. 
>> Listen to me. You need to settle down and cooperate or I can take you to jail. 
>> If you're going to give me a ticket, give me a ticket. 
>> Your attitude says you need one. 
>> Just hurry up. You're standing here talking to me. 
>> By now, tamisha has made it to her mother's side, but he she's worried her husband is in real danger too. 
>> Shut your mouth and listen. 
>> Shut my mouth. Is that how you talk to me too? 
>> Shut your mouth and listen. If you want to keep this going, I will put you in handcuffs and I will take you to jail for running a red light. If you don't settle down, your truck is illegally parked, I can tow that as well. I will do that as well. I can screw you over. I would rather not do that. Your attitude will dictate everything that happens, and right now your attitude sucks. You I can make your night very difficult. 
>> By now, more than five minutes have passed. For ryan, it all seems surreal. What should he do to get out of this situation? What can he do? Can he make it in time to say his good-byes to a woman who has meant the world to him? 
>> My mom's relationship with ryan was very different than a typical son and mother-in-law relationship. They were very good friends, very close. You know, my mom was like a jokester, so was ryan. 
>> When joe got diagnosed with cancer, her hair started falling out, so what I did was she bought a wig, I put her wig on and I told her, you see how good it look? I try to cheer her up. It worked. 
>> Tamisha and ryan have been holding vigil at her mom's bed for three weeks, rarely ever leaving her side. BUT ON MARCH 17th, THE NIGHT OF The incident, jeanetta seems to be improving a bit. 

[00:06:21]


>> The nurses were like, you know, y'all have been here all this time. Go rest, go take showers. 
>> They take the advice and go home to shower, eat, and head back to the hospital. But that plan would be interrupted. The moats make it home but shortly after they get a phone call. 
>> The nurse said, you know, she's on her last leg. You know, if you guys want to say your good-byes, you should probably come back right now. 
>> Coming up, would you spend the last moments with your loved one or obey an officer with his gun drawn? 
>> Do you have a problem? 
>> I put my hands up, like, what's going on? My mother is dying! 
>> What will ryan moats do? What will this officer do? What would you do? 
>>> And a man about to jump off a bridge. 
>> Don't jump! 
>> Eric said to me, I might be going swimming today.

>> We proceeded to the hospital with our hazard lights on. 

[00:10:48]


>> It's late at night, past midnight, when ryan's car gets to the light right before the hospital. It's red. 
>> The light didn't change. We blew our horn and I waved to the traffic. They saw hazard lights and let they saw hazard lights and didn't go. They, like, told us to go, so we went ahead and went. 
>> Ryan and tamisha believe it's fairly obvious what they're doing. The other driver seems to understand, allowing them to proceed toward the hospital. 
>> I mean, yes, I ran a red light, but at the same time i was really safe about what I was doing. I didn't just run through the red light. I stopped at the red light, got everybody's attention to let them know, hey, I'm about to come through, can I come through first? And everybody waved me on to do so. 
[ Sirens ] 
>> but then as they're pulling into the parking lot, flashing lights. 
>> Get in there. Get in there. 
>> Powell says he doesn't remember pointing his gun, only drawing it. The moats say he pointed it, first at tamisha, then at ryan. While tamisha goes in, ryan decides it's best to stay outside, hoping the officer will understand their situation. 
>> You ran a red light. 
>> We went back and forth for a little bit. And then I realized that I was talking to a wall. I mean, he wasn't going to listen. He didn't care. 
>> Did I not stop at the red light? Did I not -- 
>> stop. And then you ran through the red light. 
>> I waved the traffic off. 
>> It was still red. 
>> And then I turned. 
>> Shut your mouth andisten. 
>> Shut my mouth and listen? That's how you talk to me, dude? 
>> Shut mouth and listen. 
>> He was just, like, I can take you to jail, I can tow your car. Shut your mouth. All this different stuff that i was thinking that wasn't approprie for a cop to say to anybody. 
>> It's decision time for ryan. He knows if he stays he'll probably miss his opportunity to say good-bye and to be there for his wife. 

[00:12:51]


>> I was thinking I didn't want anything else bad to happen, so I was trying to stay as calm as possible. 
>> So ryan decides to stay and decides if he can manage to keep it cool, he will get the ticket and make it into the hospital. 
>> That's the nurse and she says the mom's dying right now. 
>> All right. 
>> The head nurse comes out to see if she can help. 
>> I'm almost done. 
>> But the officer seems to be taking his time. By now, nearly 13 minutes have passed. 
>> For the third time. 
>> Okay. 
>> The nurses say it's urgent. 
>> And finally ryan moats is issued his ticket for running a red light. 
>> Okay. Remember attitude. 
>> By the time he makes it up to his mother-in-law, it's too late. She's already gone. 
>> I was angry that he wasn't understanding. Head nurse came out and told him what was going on, another police officer came and tried to talk to him. A security guard from the hospital came out and talked to him. I was thinking about her. I don't know if anybody's ever, you know, seen a loved one pass like that. That's a hard thing to see them actually pass. That's hard. And to deal with that by yourself is even tougher. 
>> It was definitely the hardest thing that I've ever had to do in my life. And just to go in, you know, and see her like that. 
>> The videos released to the media and the dallas police department immediately issues an apology. 
>> In the course and scope of everything we deal with in a year, this is more embarrassing and troublesome because it just seems to be so unreasonable based on the circumstances. 
>> Officer robert powell issues an apology to the moats and resigns. The moats accept his apology. 
>> Guess everybody deserves a second chance as far as proving what their true character is. So hopefully after this, he'll change his ways. 

[00:14:51]


>> And the moats think change shouldn't end with robert powell. Though ryan didn't try to use his status as an nfl player during the incident, after they hoped to shine a spotlight. They meet with the dallas police department to discuss greater sensitivity training, better screening of officers, and procedures for their situation. 
>> The fact that he was an athlete makes people pay attention, and so if we have a voice to maybe help a situation, maybe bring about some changes to where someone else wouldn't have to go through what we had to go through, then that's what we're going to do. 
>> But more than anything, the moats want people to know about the type of person jeanetta collinsworth was -- a teacher, a mother, and an advocate for cancer research. They' set up a foundation called joeknowschildren in her honor.

He scrambles to his feet, but then minutes later he's pushed down again. And this time, he doesn't get up. It's 5:20 p.M.

Watch as dozens of passersby sidestep the unconscious man, jose sanchez. If you saw this altercation, what would you do? Would you call 911 or maybe even try to help him?

>> It almost becomes sickening to see that nobody actually does anything. 
>> Mark fischer is a reporter for "the washington post" who writes a column on the story called "166 chances to do the right thing." 
>> I think they ought to consider the fact that a person on the sidewalk is a person on the sidewalk. There is no excuse for the fact that so many passersby, in fact, 166 of them, chose to walk by. 
>> Hector gomez grew up in this neighborhood and now runs an organization dedicated to supporting business in the area. He says as disturbing as it is, he can understand why so many people just walked by. 
>> There are many homeless people and intoxicated vagrants in this neighborhood and throughout washington, d.C., that are laying on the ground, and you don't know if they're there just sleeping or if they're there drunk, passed out. So you do become desensitized to it. 
>> Desensitized is right. Watch as five minutes pass. Ten minutes. A man even loads his groceries into his minivan over the motionless victim. Now it's 15 minutes since sanchez hit the ground and still people just walking by. Finally, after 19 minutes, an employee in the pan am market dials 911. Paramedics arrive two minutes later. By this time, 166 pewple either witnessed the beating or walked by the motionless body without doing a thing. The incident reminds writer mark fischer of a case from years past. 
>> You know, I grew up in new york city where there was the infamous case of kitty genovese. 
>> In 1964, kitty genovese, a 28-year-old woman, is stabbed outse her queens home, then later raped and stabbed again. Nearly 40 people either see or hear the crime from their homes, but no one responds to her calls for help. 
>> That led to a lot of studies looking at what's called the bystander effect, which is when people see someone in trouble, we are far less likely to reach out and help if we see that other people are around because we assume that means, hey, the other guy has itandled, when, in fact, if everybody thinks that way, nobody helps. 

[00:22:15]


>> Unfortunately, more than four decades after the genovese murder jose sanchez suffers the same awful fate. The ambulance rushes him to the hospital, but it's too late. Sanchez dies of a traumatic brain injury three days later. 
>> Is it possible that immediate medical care would have made a difference? We'll never know for sure, but it does seem like there is a possibility. 
>> Hector gomez thinks the makeup of the population in this neighborhood may have contributed to the lack of response for either those who witnessed the knockout or those who walked by. 
>> Many of the people that walked by this person maybe wanted to do something but felt like they couldn't, you know? You might say to yourself, what if I don't have papers and I'm here illegally and I'm scared? I just won't call. 
>> That said, while gomez says he understands why so many people may not have called 911, it doesn't mean he thinks it's excusable. In fact, he decides to use the incident as a teaching lesson. 
>> I thought to myself why is it that so many people walked by and are not callin if I'm laying on the ground, i expect that first person to see me to call 911 right away. So I thought, well, let's make a call 911 campaign. 
>> Immediately following the incident, hector gets together with the police, has flyers translated into several languages, and distributes them in his neighborhood.

>> But as minutes tick by, the question soon becomes one for witnesses on the ground. What should they do? 
>> We're skating across the bridge here. 
>> Tara johnson is roller-blading through fairmont park in philadelphia with her boyfriend, garrett couples, on may 6, 2000, when their leisurely saturday afternoon takes a turn. 
>> I glanced over my left shoulder and noticed there was a gentleman sitting on the bridge. 
>> Next thing tara and garrett know, police cars and fire trucks swarm all around them. They're forced off the bridge to a nearby riverbank. 
>> I remember commenting to my girlfriend that if he does jump, I'm going in. But I don't think that I really believed that I would actually -- that it would come down to that. 
>> If it does come to that, garrett couples is qualified. He's a medical student trained in lifesaving cpr. And for eight straight summers he's been an ocean lifeguard with a perfect rescue record. 

[00:29:24]


>> I've the water at least 100 times. 
>> By now, more than 50 policemen and firefighters are on the scene, and couples assumes that with so many rescuers around they won't need his help. And up on the bridge, negotiators make contact with the man on the ledge as a crowd of onlookers gathers below. 
>> I see the big rescue truck there. I see police all along the bridge. 
>> Howard gillam works for a local cable station and just happens to be driving by when he notices some commotion. 
>> So I'm, like, hey, I've got the camera in my car. Let's get out and videotape it. 
>> Gillam estimates by the time he starts taking this dramatic video, the man, matthew buford, has already been on the bridge for ten minutes, maybe more. 
>> The leg up. 
>> Buford lets go with one hand, leaning out over the water. 
>> Don't jump! 
>> Police and firefighters are lining the bridge, but strangely, there's no rescue boat in the water. 
>> A mile down the river. 
>> But so far nearly 20 minutes have passed and no rescue boat has been able to make it there yet. 
>> Whoa. 
>> The situation appears to be getting worse. 
>> Oh, come on, buddy. Don't jump. 
>> If buford does jump, he might survive the 50-foot fall. But no one knows if he can swim. 
>> Garrett said to me, the guy's going to knock himself out and he's going to fall. A minute later he said I might be going swimming today. 
>> And then nearly 25 minutes into the ordeal, matthew buford jumps. 
>> There he goes. 
>> Oh! 
>> What y'all going to do? 
>> Okay. He can swim. 
>> After he jumped into the river, he started treading water for a while. 
>> Swim! 
>> And at this time, I'm thinkiokay, where's the rescue unit at? 
>> No matter what buford was thinking when he jumped, now in the water he seems to be fighting for his life and looks like a man who needs help. 

[00:31:28]


>> Dude ain't doing good. 
>> Dude ain't doing too good. 
>> Authorities on the bridge toss down a lifeline, but it doesn't come close. You can see it off to the right. 
>> Must have a hundred boats out there. 
>> By this time buford has been struggling for almost go minutes in the middle of a 500-foot-wide river. 
>> Come on, man. 
>> Matthew buford is losing strength. For the first time his head slips under the ter. There seems to be no official rescue response. What would you do? What would the bystanders do? Should they risk their lives for someone who might not want to be saved? 
>> And then all of a sudden he went under and I turned around to look and garrett was gone. 
>> There's somebody out there coming. 
>> Garrett couples, the lifeguard with the perfect record, is in the water, swimming from the opposite shore. Buford's head pops back up, but it's clear there isn't much time. 
>> At that point I just freestyling as fast as I could. 
>> Couples know that when a victim goes under he has only a small window, about four minutes, to save someone from drowning. 
>> He goes under one more time, that's it. 50 yards left to swim and matthew buford goes under again. 
>> Come on, man. About a half an hour. 
>> More than that. 
>> But garrett couples is closing in. 
>> I mean, my record's perfect, and I wasn't giving it up. 
>> We got 900 cops here. 
>> On the shore, all hope seems lost. 
>> That's it. 
>> But under the water, near the muddy bottom, couples is still searching. 
>> I dove to the bottom, about eight feet, at which point I saw something that appeared white. A flash. And I didn't know what it was. I took another -- maybe a half a stroke and I opened my eyes again, and at that point mr. Buford and I were face to face. 

[00:33:37]


>> Miraculously, garrett couples brings the drowning man back to the surface. With adrenaline pumping, he's lost track of time but knows the four-minute mark that might mean the difference between life and death was fast approaching. 
>> I heard mr. Buford make a sound as though he was attempting to breathe. 
>> Breathe, buddy! Come on! 
>> Garrett calls out for a life buoy he can use to brace buford as he brings him to shore. 
>> I need a brig! 
>> But authorities don't seem to understand. 
>> I gave him a second look and I noticed that now his lips were getting blue and I knew at that point it's -- you have to make a decision. 
>> This is a very difficult decision for couples to make. To prevent the spread of aids and other diseases, modern rescue crews carry plastic equipment so they can give emergency breathing without direct mouth-to-mouth contact, part of what's called universal precautions. 
>> I knew that it was probably going to be a couple minutes before I could get him to shore. I didn't think that he had a chance unless I ventilated him. 
>> He's trying to give him mouth to mouth. 
>> That boy is good. 
>> Now finally, help is on the way. But it's not a policeman or fireman. Like garrett, it's just another person who was out in the park that day. 
>> When he went under water, the clock's ticking instantly. And that's why I went in the water. 
>> Steven lloyd is a 46-year-old registered nurse, but unlike garrett couples he's not a lifeguard. In fact, steven lloyd says he hasn't been swimming in ten years. 
>> He's trying to do something. 
>> I just asked him, do you have any training? 
>> And I gulped on water and i said I'm exhausted. 
>> I said, okay, well grab him under his arm and we're going to tow him to shore. 
>> It's been more than four minutes now since matthew buford went under when garrett couples reaches the shore. But if he expects help to be waiting, he's in for another surprise. 
>> Come on. Come on. Get him over. 
>> I expected them to have everything possible to save this gentleman set up and ready to go. At the very minimum the bag masks we use to ventilate somebody and oxygen. I mean, that alone does worlds of good. 

[00:35:51]


>> Get down there! 
>> Keep the camera rolling. 
>> Out of the way. 
>> But as the videotape shows, only now are authorities pushing spectators back, scrambling over the railing down to the river. 
>> I gave him two breaths before I handed him over and they pulled him on shore and began chest compressions. I remember hearing steven lloyd shouting at them. 
>> I saintilate him, ventilate him, ventilate him. And they were, like, sir, we can't. Universal precautions. 
>> Now more time ticks away. You can see a rescuer carrying a plastic bag with the all-important breathing gear. Only now on the way down to the river. 
>> The man needed to be ventilated. I really thought this guy could have been saved. I really did. 
>> We really tried. By the time philadelphia rescue crews get him up from the riverbank and to a local hospital, it's too late. Matthew buford is dead. 
>> No one will ever know for sure whether he could have bn saved. Garrett couples says he doesn't blame the crowd or the police for not jumping in if they weren't properly trained. But he says it's hard to believe with so many authorities on the scene that none of them knew how to make a water rescue. 
>> I mean, it's -- it doesn't make sense to me that you have fire rescue within two blocks, marine rescue within two miles, and none of them are trained in water rescue. To me, that is -- I mean, that's unspeakable. 
>> After the incident, the victim's family files a complaint and the philadelphia police department conducts an internal investigation. The internal investigation concludes that their officers provided adequate service. As soon as police were notified of buford's position, they dispatch a negotiator and within minutes also call their marine unit. But the marine unit, though based nearby, had been dispatched to another river earlier that day and is miles away, pulling up abandoned cars when they get the call. They immediately head for the bridge, but as we now know, don't make it in time. As for the criticism that the officers present should have done more, in a letter to a local newspaper the then philadelphia police commissioner writes -- it's unfair to criticize officers for not making unreasonably dangerous efforts to rescue someone who made it clear he did not wish to be rescued and who could very easily have caused the death of the officers." 

[00:38:43]


[ Applause ] 
>> when garrett couples climbs up from the shore, the crowd gives him and steven lloyd a round of applause for the choices they made that day. But while the onlookers are impressed by what garrett couples did do, he can only think about the fact that a man lost his life and wonders what else could have been done. 
>> I think it came down to lack of training, no protocol, and no plan of action. I don't think I'll ever truly accept the fact that I did everything I could, because I'm always going to look back on it and say, you know, was there something different I could have done.

>> The tasing goes viral with a tantalizing headline.

>> And without the full story, it seems this video will be damaging to the officer. His own dashboard cam catches him yelling at and shoving an elderly woman half his size. But watch the video again. This time listening to more of the conversation. It may change your opinion of the officer's decision. 
>> Came around the curve, up the hill and you accelerated. 
>> First the deputy tries to get winkfein to sign her ticket, agreeing that she'd show up for court. 
>> I'm a 72-year-old woman.

>> Get back over there. 
>> I'm getting back in my car. 
>> You are going to be tased. 
>> I'm getting back in my car.

>> So finally the officer makes good on his promise. 
>> Get on the ground. Get on the ground.

>> put your hands behind your back. Put your hands behind your back or you'll be tased again! 
>> The video sparks a national debate on morning news shows. 
>> Okay, let me ask you, did the deputy do what was right or did he go over the line? 
>> Hands behind your back. You are going to be tased again. 
>> I would say he went a little over the line. 
>> Really? 
>> He kept shoving this 72-year-old woman. 
>> I think he pushed her because they're in traffic. Get her off the road. She kept trying to get the door of the car. 
>> Couldn't he just grab and -- 
>> she kept saying don't touch me. You are going to shove a 72-year-old woman. I think at some point --

>> put your hands behind your back. 
>> So should the deputy have found another way to gain control? 
>> He had attempted to put handcuffs on her, advising her she was under arrest. And she broke away from him. That's physical noncompliance. If he would have forced her down to the ground against -- totally against her will, he could have broke something. He mitigatedhis event safely, effectively and efficiently. 

[00:47:40]


>> Medical personnel check out winkfein at the scene and she's not hurt from the tasing. But she is charged with resisting arrest, a charge she's fighting. And she sends a letter to the travis county commissioner's office demanding $165,000 for pain and suffering, medical expenses and humiliation. The commissioner's office settles with winkfein for $40,000. The constable's office maintains the officer did nothing wrong and calls the payout a miscarriage of justice, insists it sets a bad precedent. The county judge says defending a lawsuit would have cost more than $40,000. Winkfein tells us she's satisfied and just wants to put the whole thing behind her. Sometimes decisions are made on gut instinct. There's no time to evaluate the consequences. And at a bank in seattle, washington, another man makes a quick deci will he regret it? 
>> Put the bag on the counter. He said this is a ransom. Fill the bag with money. 
>> Jim nicholson is the teller in this video. When the robber demands the money, caught on the bank's security cameras, jim's instincts kick in. 
>> I grabbed the bag, threw it on the ground and said where is it? Referring to if he had a weapon. 
>> It's a bold move by the teller. The robber hesitates. He doesn't show a weapon. What would you do in this situation? Would you give the robber what he wants or call his bluff? Would you attempt an aggressive move? The teller makes his decision. 
>> I lunged towards him. He backed off. At that point I ran around the counter and chased him. 
>> Nicholson chases the robber down the street, tackling him and pinning him down until police arrive soon after. Some see jim nicholson as a hero, but his bosses at the bank don't agree. Two days after the robbery attempt, he's fired. Some customers are outraged. 
>> I just can't believe that he would get fired for doing something that I feel was right. 

[00:49:44]


>> Bank policy says tellers are supposed to comply with the robber, give him what he wants. Basically the goal should be to get the robber out of the bank. Key bank has this to say. Our policies and procedures are in the best interests of public safety and are consistent with industry standards. Money, which is insured, can be replaced. Lives cannot." The fbi which advises banks on the best and safest approach agrees. 
>> In no way do we suggest physical confrontation with a robber. Too many thing cans go wrong. 
>> Butickelson says, believe it or not, he's confronted other robbers in retail jobs in the past thinks letting the guy get with it isn't the answer. 
>> I have to represent him so he cannot do this again, so he cannot come to our branch and try to rob us again. 
>> The robber won't be visiting this branch or any bank soon. He pleads guilty to the bank robbery and is sentenced to three years behind bars followed by three years of parole. And that's enough reward for nickelson. He said despite being fired, if he had it to do all over again, he would.

It's just past midnight and mohammed is finishing up some paperwork before locking up for the night.

>> The thief's words weigh heavily on mohammed, so next in an extremely odd twist, the shop owner makes an unexpected decision. 
>> I feel bad. I'm going to help him. I tell him, listen, promise me you will never rob anybody again. 
>> With the promise, mohammed decides he's going to give money to the man who wanted to take it from him only minutes earlier. 
>> I come back around the counter, open the cash register, take $40, and I tell him take this money. Go take it to your family and never rob anybody again. 
>> Mohammed's compassion seems to hit the thief hard. The now kneeling robber tells mohammed he wants to change his life in a big way. 
>> He tells me I want to be a muslim just like you. I said you sure about that, you want to be a muslim just like me, say okay, but put your right hand up. He put his right hand up. I tell him I say -- 
[ speaking foreign language ] he does same thing. And then after the prayer, i shake hand, I say congratulations. You are a muslim. You are a muslim brother. 
>> Mohammed knows the $40 he gave the guy will only get him so far, so he decides to do even more. I tell him, I say take the bat, let me grab the milk for your family. I go in the back, I grab the milk, he's gone. He's left. 
>> Mohammed says he wasn't going to call the police, but because the robber chooses to run away instead of taking his mask off and facing mohammed like a man, he decides this thief's conversion may not have been completed. And now he's alone in the store left to think about the decisions he just made. First, his decision to overtake the man attacking him. 
>> If the person have the gun, knife, this kind of stuff, then I'm going to say okay, brother, what do you need? You want my cash register, you can have it. When I see a baseball bat, then I'm thinking to myself, I say i can handle that. 

[00:58:38]


>> Then the decision to help the very man trying to rob him. 
>> Some people say why don't you shoot him? I say, please, I can't do this thing. When I'm a little baby, my mom tell me, son, when somebody come to you, help him. 
>> So that's exactly what mohammed does. And when the cops ask the good samaritan if he wants to press charges, he declines, figuring the robber probably learned his lesson, and mohammed says he learned a few lessons too. 
>> You know, this thing, this helped to make me a change man. Shirley is my hometown, but mostly people cannot believe it, mostly people in california are sending me checks, and in future I'm going to make a charity. I'm going to help people. It's changed my whole life. 
>> Unfortunately, less than a year after the incident, mohammed falls victim to a bad economy and is forced to close the store he ran in shirley for 15 years. But true to his word, he dough 
-- he donates whatever remains on his shelves to local churches and charities. If you have a video you would like to send to us, logon to our website, caught on camera msnbc.Com. I'm contessa brewer. That's all for this edition of "caught on camera."

>> Narrator: Scallops of sand, endless meanders of marsh and tidal creek. If the shoreline of the chesapeake bay could be unraveled it would stretch from the east to west coast and back. The chesapeake is the country's largest estuary, where saltwater mixes with fresh. 200 miles long, three miles across at its narrowest, nearly 30 at its widest. Yet for hundreds of square miles it is knee-deep. Romance clings to the private coves, the watery sunsets, the smell in the breeze. There is, perhaps, a tendency to long for what has been lost of its heritage. But soaring above, we see how much of it remains, 

[00:02:01]


and the incredible beauty held in its embrace. Anyone who has ever hauled a catch from its depths, loafed the small towns that ring it, beheld the marshes blazing in the sun, or skimmed the surface, knows it's more than just a place on the map. Experience the treasured chesapeake, her famous landmarks, natural wonders, cities, towns, and preserves that still look as glo and untouched as they did a thousand years ago, all from an exhilarating vantage point. [Captioned by Maryland public television] dawn over the susquehanna river, headwaters of the chesapeake bay. The chesapeake is the drowned lley of the susquehanna, engorged by the melting waters of glaciers ten thousand years ago at the end of the last ice age. Named for the native susquehannocks who lived along the riverbanks, its headwaters begin far to the north, flowing down through pennsylvania and new york state, into the chesapeake bay and out to sea. 

[00:04:01]


Conowingo is native susquehannock for "at the rapids." Here, at those rapids, a hydroelectric plant harnesses the surging momentum of the river. The rocky bottom and canyon-like walls of the river little resemble the wide, pan-flat, mud-bottomed bay broadening on the horizon. Just beyond the town of havre de grace, "harbor of grace," where highway and railroad span the widening river, the chesapeake bay is born. A new day brings a flurry of activity and the inevitable feeling of possibilities up and down the bay. 

[00:06:12]


Standing majestic in morning light, calvert cliffs dominate the southern maryland shoreline for 30 miles. Formed over 15 million years ago, when southern maryland was awash in a shallow sea, these cliffs teem with fossils. South of the cliffs, homes with water's view bask in the sun. We are drawn to places like solomons island, where land meets the great estuary. The calvert marine museum, home of the drum point lighthouse, symbolizes a once-booming fishing village, with fleets of schooners & sloops centered 'round the hauling and shucking of oyster, that has become a popular point of departurr those in search of adventure and favorable winds. 

[00:08:39]


Tranquility seems to define life on the bay, but appearances deceive. Every day, nature's rhythms and human rituals play out. Smith island is located 12 miles out in the bay. Her quintessential fishing villages cling to the few patches of ground above sea level. Come sunrise on any given morning, the towns of tylerton, ewell, and rhodes point are deserted. Everyone is out crabbing. 

[00:10:47]


Smith island fishermen, a fiercely independent breed, heed the call of the water and chart the very same courses of their forbearers, doing what 13 generations before have done since the first settlement at jamestown in 1607. For hard-working watermen, the bay has always held the promise of plentiful rewards. Pound nets jut from the shore like arrows pointing towards a bountiful catch. Watermen can still earn a living by fishing, crabbing, and oystering... But it is becoming increasingly challenging. Dredgers, pound netters, purse netters, hand tongers, crabbers...Fishermen of all kinds casting their fortunes in chesapeake waters. 

[00:13:11]


Holds heavy with the harvest; rockfish, bluefish, crabs, oysters, whatever the day's catch, return home... ...To towns like crisfield, rock hall, chestertown, solomons, tilghman, and scores of others. There are reasons why these places were settled long ago. Proximity to the bay meant, of course, pleasant living. But also fruitful labor, and sustenance. Deep and safe harbor. Upriver, and protected, yet connected by navigable waterways, enabling vital trade. On the banks of the c river, chestertown was a thriving port of entry for early maryland settlers 

[00:15:11]


and boom town of colonial commerce. George washington gave chestertown his stamp of approval with the founding of washington college in 1782. First college established in the new nation. Locals who live by the waters side can hardly conceive of any other place to be.

The only thing you have to do now is get up and go the phone and make a pledge. It's really easy to do. And after you've done it, sit back and enjoy the rest of chesapeake bay by air. >> Narrator: Baltimore...City on the bay, broad shouldered, blue collar, offbeat, idiosyncratic, port of try, cultural center. Home of the star spangled banner. Locust point, the first port of baltimore; tobao shipping out, sugar from the caribbean shipping in. 

[00:27:36]


City of neighborhoods: Fells point, federal hill, bolton hill, cherry hill, canton. Outside baltimore, where the patapsco river meets the bay, sparrows point. A once-sprawling complex of steelmaking and shipbuilding. IN THE MID-1950s, THE LARGEST Steel mill in the world. 

[00:29:40]


Producing steel for the golden gate bridge, and cables for the george washington bridge. The chesapeake draws life from the rivers that feed it. More than 150 rivers flow into this immense transition zone from fresh to saltwater. Only the columbia and the mississippi send more water out to sea. From the north comes the susquehanna, sassafras, chester and elk. From the east; wicomico, choptank, nanticoke, pocomoke. And the west; the patapsco, potomac, patuxent and york, the rappahannock, the james. 

[00:32:09]


These are the rivers of colonial history, alive with fish, fowl, and crustacean. In springtime, pulsating with fish moving upstream from saltwater to spawn. Few places anywhere on the bay are as haunting, and striking, as the blackwater national wildlife refuge. Swirling geometry, jagged, irregular, green-gold marshscape, etched in sharp relief against brackish waters. Admiring the smooth reflections in the bows and guts, it's easy to overlook, that down below, the blackwater is alive with birds, animals, insects and fish. 

[00:34:10]


The blackwater is a chief wintering area along the atlantic flyway. In the fall, these lands become a spectacle of canada geese, snow geese, tundra swan, ducks. In winter, the bald eagle nests. As a national wildlife refuge, the blackwater symbolizes commitment to preserve the irreplaceable landscapes we treasure for future generations. The voyages of captain john smith charting the chesapeake waterways are legendary. Having established the english settlement at jamestown, john smith's chesapeake adventures opened his eyes to a new world of lush forests, water teeming with life, native americans living along the banks. His maps and writings of "this very goodly bay" strongly influenced european settlement of the region. Settled on high ground above a peaceful tidewater bay, historic st. Mary's city. First settlement and new capital of the fledgling maryland colony. Outlines and forms speak of a once bustling city: 

[00:36:14]


The jesuit church, courthouse, and small tobacco and corn plantations. Reminders of maryland's very first years, when men and women took a daring risk: Hewing a new life from a new land. From the founding of the colony, until today, agriculture has sustained the local economy. The farm fields of chesapeake country are rich, fertile, and paint the landscape with striking hues. Tobacco, sweet corn, melons, soybean, soak up the dense nutrients in the soil producing abundant yields. 

[00:39:27]


The linear views from the surface of the earth, of water, marsh, or simple field of hay, acquire shape, form, perspective, rising into the air. Tilghman island typifies the meeting place between farmland and watershed common on the eastern shore. Fishing boats, for pleasure and work, line up. A stone's throw from farm fields that stretch out to island's end. In the winter, foraging grounds for canada geese. A world apart...Blissfully so. 

[00:41:34]


Tides; inexorable and never ending. Waves; rhythmic, pounding. Currents; saltwater moving up the bay, freshwater moving down. Violent wind; tropical storm, hurricane. All keep the chesapeake shoreline in tenuous ebb and flow. Holland island, nesting home for hundreds of brown pelicans, was once a thriving community... Hundreds of residents, a general store, school, church, and a fleet of schooners and skipjacks. But the chesapeake encroaches, almost at will. Decades of erosion from wind and tide, and the ravages of hurricane isabel in 2003, the island slips into memory. Sharps island lighthouse stands near the entrance to the choptank river, warning seafarers of the shoals off poplar island. The towering, cast iron, concrete-filled hulk, proved no match for the mighty force of winter ice that thrust sharps island lighthouse into a precarious 20-degree 

[00:43:36]


list. Prime real estate high atop the cliffs at calvert county comes with spectacular views. But these edges, where land and water meet, are on the move. Every now and then, eroding earth tumbles down to the shore. The cliff top is receding. Breakwaters and riprap slow, but cannot stop the process. The forces of nature are continually at work, shifting the shoreline, reshaping islands, creeks, rivulets, marshes. A long-term, barely perceptible transformation. 

[00:45:43]


We, in turn, have left our own indelible human imprints on the landscape. Linear patterns sliced into marsh, reminiscent of england's mysterious crop circles, or a child's stick figures, ARE THE REMAINS OF THE 1950s, When these marshlands were the site for chemical testing. In 1942, the navy designated bloodsworth island an impact zone for naval bombardment. By 1967, an estimated 230,000 rounds were fired at the island from surface ships. Unexploded ordnance remains. The island is off-limits, and can only be viewed from the air. 

[00:48:01]


On the upper bay, an island, and a restoration success story, literally take shape. Hart-miller island was headed for total submersion, but extensive dredging of the baltimore harbor produces the perfect by-product. The dredgings are pumped onto perimeter dikes, raising the island's elevations, and the hopes for its future. Today, this little known gem is a maryland state park, accessible only by boat, with beaches, mudflats, and vital habitat for shorebirds and waterfowl. >> What an amazing program. Hello everybody, I'm donald thomas, and I'm here with rhea feikin. And we do want you to stay tuned for the conclusion of chesapeake bay by air. You know, this program is transporting us to many of the chesapeake bay's countless and stunning locations; from the susquehanna river to the marsh of the blackwater wildlife refuge.

Clement's island, where the maryland colony began. During the revolutionary war, the british controlled the island, blockading the potomac passageway. In the civil war, confederates destroyed the lantern and lens to prevent it aiding the union forces. At one time, 74 lighthouses illuminated chesapeake waters, warning sailors, steamers, and fishing fleets away from treacherous currents, shoals, shallows. At the very tip of southern maryland, down where the potomac empties into the bay, point lookout lighthouse stands. 

[01:00:33]


This spit of land was the site of an infamous civil war prison, where 4,000 confederate soldiers perished and whose remains were interred here. More than 30 lighthouses still stand in the chesapeake. Some retired as relics of a past age. Others still shine forth as important aids to navigation. Perhaps most emblematic of them all, undoubtedly the most photographed, thomas point lighthouse warns ships of a sandbar extending out from shore near the sailing mecca of annapolis. 

[01:02:33]


Brave thomas point light somehow survived the assault of 23 foot waves crashing upon it from tropical storm agnes in 1972. Eminently navigable, the bay has always been a superhighway; freighters, steamers, tugs, and tows. Water is a way of commerce and means of transport. 

[01:05:06]


The chesapeake bay skipjack, iconic in form, symbol of the bay's boat building heritage. Skipjack nathan of dorchester is an exquisite example of the form. Built as a light, inexpensive craft for oyster dredging the shallows, hundreds of skipjacks once thrived here. True to form, skipjack nathan cuts through the choptank river almost without effort. The schooner sultana is an exact replica of colonial merchant vessels that once patrolled the north american coast, but now serves as a classroom on the water. Annapolis, celebrated as the sailing capital of america. State capital of maryland. General washington resigned his command of the continental army here, when annapolis was the temporary capital 

[01:07:07]


of the united states. High on a hill, the maryland state house is the oldest legislative building in continuous use in the nation. Waterfront streets are steeped in colonial history. Safe harbor and launch point for recreational veels of all kinds. Proud home of the united states naval academy. Here, aboard sailboats, in the classroom, and on athletic fields, in "four years by the bay," the midshipmen ideals of duty, honor and loyalty take shape. Completed in 1952, the first of towering twin spans of the chesapeake bay bridge, enabled easy migration to the eastern shore. 

[01:09:14]


So, we "getaway" to places quaint, picturesque, like historic st. Michaels, on the miles river. The chesapeake bay maritime museum, and hooper straight lighthouse, mark land where once there were seafood packing houses, docks, and workboats. It's a place where a seafaring past meets the sailors... And pleasure boaters of the present. The back bays of st. Michaels, sculpted with protected coves, and easy water access, are fashionable getaway spots. Highway 50, and the choptank river fishing pier, lead the way into cambridge, one of the oldest cities in maryland. Like any other waterfront town, life in cambridge is measured not by how much, or how fast, but the tides, the wind, and the waves.

The sun retreats to the western horizon, casting long shadows over the nanticoke. A river system of serene splendor. Individual, curvaceous, meandering. For a long time, the nanticoke remained undeveloped, its shorelines thick with forest, its waters one of the most productive for fishermen and pound netters. A place that inspires hope that chesapeake country will always look just as it does today. >> Rhea: We have just seen

>> Okay. 
>>> You're in the cnn newsroom, I'm drew griffin in for don lemon tonight. This will be a pivotal week in the political battle between those who want stricter gun control laws and those fighting to protect the right to own guns in the united states. On tuesday, the vice president and his task force will send gun violence recommendations to the oval office. Bo sides bracing for a fight. We have more on this story in a moment. But first, police in san diego were forced to shoot a man with a gun who ran inside a movie theater. The officers reen spoding to a domestic disturbance call yesterday when they chased the armed suspect into a crowded theater. Moviegoers poured out. Officers shot the suspect who survived, but is in critical condition tonight. 
>>> American troops help france in an attempt to rescue a french intelligence agent. President obama today detailed the u.S. Involvement in the mission, which was friday night. He said, u.S. Troops led to what he called limited technical support and made american aircraft available if needed. The mission failed. The captured agent was not rescued and the french government believes he is dead. 
>>> Hundreds of thousands of people opposing same sex marriage rallied on the streets of paris today. France's president is pushing a plan to legalize same sex marriage and adoptions. It faces strong opposition from the roman catholic church. The plan is expected to be voted on by the national assembly in march or february. A break for americans hoping to adopt russian kids, a ban on american adoptions willing not go into effect until next year, according to a russian news agency. Hundreds of russians in moscow protest the russian government's ban, believing that freeze on adoptions was passed as backlash for the passage of a new u.S. Law, which targets human rights violations in russia about the decision to delay the ban means 46 adoptions underway should go through. Former president george h.W. Bush may finally get to leave the hospital this week, the 43rd president shown on his birthday in june has beenn the hospital since november 23rd for bronchitis and then what was described as a stubborn fever, his son, jeb bush says his dad is expected to be released tomorrow.

>>> The nfl playoffs are down to four. The atlanta fs kick a game winning field goal in the final seconds, defeating the seahawks 30-28. Atlanta advancing to the conference championship game next sunday against san francisco. Tom braidly led new england to a 41-28 win over the texans. The patriots play baltimore in the afc championship game. 
>>> It's 30 days since the massacre at that elementary school in connecticut, and just two days until the vice president and his task force, make public their ideas to put the brakes on gun violence. Listen to some of the statements from lawmakers. 
>> I'm urging our country's major gun retailers like walmart and sports authority to suspend sales of modern assault style weapons until congress is able to fully consider and vote on legislation to curb gun violence. 
>> When a president takes all the power of his office, if he's willing to expend political capital, you don't want to bet your house on the outcome, but i would say that the likelihood is, they're not going to be able to get an assault weapons ban through congress. 
>> Let's be honest, we're not always going to be able to find these individuals who on a dime turn into mad men. And what could have helped here in newtown is a ban on assault weapons. I have to tell you, if we had a ban on assault weapons and a ban on high capacity magazine clips, this guy would have never taken up weapons in the first place. There would be little boys and girls alive in newtown today, i believe, if you had banned assault weapons and these high capacity magazine clips. That's something question can do now and do now. 

[00:04:58]


>> Susan candiotti is in newtown connecticut. The people of that town marked one month today. There's the delicate subject of what to do about the school itself, do they make it a memorial or tear it down? 
>> Reporter: Tonight in new town, there was a public forum with many people trying to decide what to do about the future of sandy hook elementary school, where the shooting occurred. And there were so many different opinions. Do they tear it down forever? Do they rebuild the school? Do they put a memorial there? Hard to get a consensus, not surprising in this town since it's onlz been a month since the shooting. 
>> St. Rose of lima church lost nine of its youngest members at sandy hook. A vigil drew thousands that first night, and then there were the funerals. 
>> I was this far away from the families. It was palpable what they were going through. 
>> How well are people healing? 
>> There's a lot of pain, a lot of grief, when it's going to go away I don't know, it may not every go away. 
>> Something that astounds deacon rick scinto and parishioners. 
>> It's a month later, what are all these boxes doing here? 
>> These are the gifts, letters, prayer cards coming in from all over the country, all over the world. 
>> Thousands of pieces of mail carefully sorted for each victim, including the shooter's mother and the killer himself. 
>> What is this all a sign of? 
>> This is the world putting their arm around newtown and saying, we're here for you in some way. 
>> Like a huge banner that reads, we are with you newtown, filled with signatures hanging from an overpass. It's all the way from tucson, arizona. The sight of the gabby giffords mass shooting, down the street from the elementary school, a beau co marks the spot where a makeshift memorial once stood, now dismantled, composted, preserved for a permanent memorial. In this community people turned to each other for strength. Many with the same question. 

[00:07:11]


>> The main question is why. Why did this happen, how did this happen? 
>> Seeking answers no one may ever have. 
>> At this point no perfect answer about the future of sandy hook elementary. Drew? 
>> Susan candiotti tonight in newtown connecticut. Could we see congress take up legislation that would ban assault rifles? We're going to hear from the left and the right about the chances such a proposal might have. Uhh, it's next month, actually... EDDIE continues 
singing: Two Tickets to... Paradiiiiiise! No four. Remember? Whoooa whooaa whooo! You know Ronny, folks who save hundreds of dollars by switching to GEICO sure are happy. And how happy are they Jimmy? Happier than Eddie Money running a travel agency. Get happy. Get GEICO. Fifteen minutes could save you fifteen percent or more. is work. And his new boss told him two things -- cook what you love, and save your money. Joe doesn't know it yet, but he'll work his way up from busser to waiter to chef before opening a restaurant specializing in fish and game from the great northwest. He'll start investing early, he'll find some good people to help guide him, and he'll set money aside from his first day of work to his last, which isn't rocket science. It's just common sense. From td ameritrade. the pain with odor free aspercreme. Powerful medicine relieves pain fast, with no odor. So all you notice is relief. Aspercreme. 

[00:09:59]


>>> Vice president biden's proposals for reducing gun violence are expected to focus on video games and other subjects that should get people talking. The last ban didn't work anyway. When I talked about it with elcy granderson and el navarro, i asked lz his thoughts? 
>> It's interesting, there are three different conversations in my opinion, that's happening in regard to guns. The first conversation is about mass shootings, and what are we going to do about that, the second conversation is about the shootings that happen every other day in our streets, particularly in chicago. And then the conversation about the culture of guns, and that's where the movie violence and the video games come in from. I'm curious to see what vice president biden is going to unveil, those are three different conversations, you can't clean this all up with one fell swoop. 
>> I want to ask you about the strategy here, the president, he goes for an assault weapons ban, will have to use a lot of political muscle to do that, if you look at the fbi statistics, we have horrific events that occur with these guns sometimes mostly it is pistols and handguns that are involved stistically in the crimes, if you're going to attack the murders in this country would you attack those other guns. I'm wondering why you think it is they would like to go after the assault weapons at this time. 
>> I think lz was exactly right. There are three different conversations going on, I think they have to turn it into one big comprehensive approach. If it's only framed as an assault weapons ban, it will have a difficult time going through congress. But, yes, you know, the president is going to have to spend the capital, he has it and he's going to have to spend it, I'm sure vice president biden who is pregnant the with this, this is his baby. In case we haven't noticed, he's already running for president, he's going to want something done. The issue is not going away, as cnn was covering the meetings of the vice president on the issue, they had to breakaway, because there was yet another school shooting going on at the same time. Every time there is a shooting and the sad reality is, that these things will continue happening in all likelihood, the american people are going to ask, what has been done since newtown, that will become the new question. This issue had been under the rug for the last four years, it had been awfully quiet, despite all the different episodes we've had of shootings, now the pandora box is open, and the expectation of the american people that something moves is much greater than it's been in the last four years, his way of doing it is a comprehensive approach. 

[00:12:58]


>> Pete rose weighs in on this past week's baseball hall of fame snub. But as you'll see, his remarks don't sit well with one of the hall of fame voters. plays ] humans. EVEN WHEN WE CROSS OUR t's AND DOT OUR I's, We still run into problems. Namely, other humans. Which is why at liberty mutual insurance, auto policies come with new car replacement and accident forgiveness if you qualify. See what else comes standard at libertymutual.Com. Liberty mutual insurance. Responsibility. What's your policy? 

[00:15:32]


>>> Usa today reports lance armstrong will admit doping in an interview with oprah win friday. His interview will air thursday, his first television interview since he was stripped of his SEVEN tour de Francetitles. Cycling observers say it's about time armstrong confessed. 
>> Better late than never. I mean, it's bad he did it to start with, but at least he'll come clean so to speak. 
>> Nww that he's been dropped from the cycling world, I don't think it will hurt him, i believe that this will soften up his admission of -- if he does admit it, it will bring him back into the cycling world. 
>> Thursday's interview will air at 9:00 p.M. On the oprah win friday network. Other sports news for the eighth time in history, no one was elected to the national baseball hall of fame this year. The baseball writers association said no to barry bonds, roger CLEMENS, mark McGwire and sammy sosa. Those are some of the biggest names in baseball history, but all allegedly cheated by using performance enhancing drugs. Earlier, don lemon asked former cincinnati reds superstar pete rose, himself banned from the hall of fame for gambling. His thoughts on the hall of fame shutout, and the odds that one day he might be inducted. 
>> As far as the guys you mentioned, with the exception of clemmens, because he's a pitcher, wouldn't it be nice if you could interview babe ruth? Roger maris, hank aaron? Those are the guys who lost their records because of the suspension of steroids, not -- i don't know if I'll get in trouble for this, I have to defend roger clemmens in this. The reason I have to defend him is b until this day, he says he didn't take steroids, and he's never flunked a drug test, and he went in front of two different courts and they both ruled in favor of him. Who am I to say that roger clemens took steroids because he won some games after he's 40 years old. Bonds admitted he put the steroids on him, sosa flunked a test. Palmeiro flunked a test, let's talk about biggio and piazza and jack morris. 

[00:17:44]


>> Yeah, that was my next question. Let me ask the question, there were others on the ballot, catcher mike piazza as you said, the dodgers and the mets, craig biggio was on there, long time second baseman for the houston astros. And curt schilling. Many say he helped the boston red sox win in 2007. The fact that they got shut out, does that surprise you? 
>> It does. At least one of them should go in there, I nder if what happened. Did all the writers say, there's too many guys connected to steroids, don't put anybody in. That's not fair to those guys. Craig biggio was the first player that was on the ballot for the first time that didn't make the hall of fame since 1945. That's how long that's been. And there hasn't been anybody going into the hall of fame since 1996. So that's strange too. We got friendscooperstown that own stores and they rely on cooperstown week to survive for the whole year. We wonder what's going to happen with those people with no induction. 
>> While I have you here, can we talk about lance armstrong? What do you make of his situation? 
>> Well, lance is a little bit like me, I'll tell you why, for anybody watching us talk, i would give them some advice. If you do something wrong, come clean quick. As quick as you possibly can. I waited too long, lance waited too long. It's just going to build up and get worse and worse and worse. So admit your problem, attack your problem, I'm at peace with myself now, it took me some years to do what bart giamatti wanted me to do, he wanted me to take responsibility for what i did. I've done that now. My mind's clean, my body's clean, my fans understand that, my teammates understand it, and 'll go from there. That's what lance needs to do. 

[00:19:50]


>> It was for you, it wasn't about drugs it was about bet something. 
>> Yeah, yeah. 
>> Do you think someone who physically alters their body should be allowed in the hall of fame at all before you? 
>> The records of baseball are a sacred thing, that's why baseball cards are worth more than basketball cards or football cards, it started in 1869 and wouldn't it be nice if youcould talk to hank aaron today or roger maris or babe ruth? Those are the guys who lost the records. If someone got 4257 and beat my record and was linked to steroids, I would have a lot of things to say about him. Up until now, that has not happened. When you alter the statistics of baseball, you're really chaeting the fans of every era, and the fans of today's era, it's not right. 
>> You think you should be eligible for the hall of fame and -- are you hoping? You think one day it will change? 
>> Well, here's what I think. I think this is america. And I think everybody at one time or another should be given a second chance. Everyone that's what I'm waiting for, and I'm not here to complain, I'm the one that screwed up. I'm not complaining to anybody, I just hope that someone that runs baseball will feel in their heart to give me a second chance. I won't need a third. I'll guarantee you that. 
>> America's pastime, it's all about redemption. We love a good redemption story. 
>> Yes.

>>> I spoke with terence moore, I asked about this week's announcement that hall of fame voters had chosen no one to join the hall from this year's ballot. And terence took iss with pete rose's defense of roger clemens. 
>> Well, two confessions, i personally have known pete rose for 35 years. He was my all time favorite player growing up as a youth. It pains me to say this but pete is wrong about this. Roger clemens best friend at the time said roger clemens told him he used steroids. He backed out at the last minute when he was talking to the feds. The other thing pete said, numbers matter in baseball more so than any other sport. I mean, baseball's been around since 1869, have you these steroid users going against willie mays and hank aaron in history books is not fair to the guys of the past when you lump these knuckle heads in with them. 

[00:22:35]


>> This steroid era lasted awhile, could we see a repeat next year and the year after. 
>> Two former atlanta braves heroes, they're going to right the ship, they will be first ballot hall of famers, no steroids there, this will become a moot point.

We've been out here for a couple hours looking for pythons, it's not that easy to find them, that's for sure. At night, they like to come up by the road and take the warmth of that road off the payment and that keeps their bodies warm. They're cold blooded creatures. I'm joined by justin matthews. You're a wildlife expert trying to find these things. The reality is, we didn't get any, didn't find any. That's to be expected. 
>> Yes, it is. A needle in a haystack. I would be surprised if we came out today and got a snake. 
>> It's been so warm lately? 
>> Yes, been so warm, they've been curled up, been, you know, hiding in the shade in the thicket, where people can't go, and chances are we've walked right by one today. Didn't see it. 
>> It's an invasive species, they're trying to get rid of them here, the real problem in florida. South florida especially, right? 
>> Yes, big problem, they're killing our native wildlife. 
>> Not that many, though? 
>> And they're doing -- killing the native wildlife? 
>> Yes, they are, and that's why we're here. We've run a wildlife rescue and we want to save native wildlife. 

[00:27:34]


>> There's a month of this hunt to go, you'll be back. You're going to try to get some more. 
>> Yeah. 
>> The reality is, as justin was saying, it's like a needle in a heystack out here, or anywhere. There's millions of acres of everglades, maybe there's 100, 150,000 of these snakes out here, that's at the top end. It's really going to be interesting to see how many people over the course of the month catch snakes and how many are brought in in total john 12k5 rel la, cnn reporting from the florida everglades. 
>>> Lf past the hour now, let's take a look at the headlines. On tuesday, a task force headed by vice president joe biden, expected to recommend a ban on assault style weapons. That's just one option the task force may put in the president's desk in the wake of the connecticut shooting a month ago. President obama made clear this weekend he is ready for a fight over how he responds to the recommendations. 
>>> American troops helped france in an attempt to rescue a french intelligence agent held hostage by militants in somalia. President obama detailed the u.S. Involvement which happened friday night. He said u.S. Troops landed limited technical support and made american aircraft available if needed. The mission failed. The captured agent was not rescued, and the french government believes he is now dead. 
>>> Former president george h.W. Bush may get to leave the hospital this week. The 41st president shown here on his birthday last june has been in the hospital since november 23rd for bronchitis and then what was described as a stubborn feev. His son, former florida governor jeb bush says his dad is expected to be released tomorrow. The family spokesman says they are hopeful, but still taking it a day at a time.

The patriots are set to play baltimore in the afc championship game. 
>>> As I mentioned a moment ago, the nation should know tuesday whether the vice president's gun task force will recommend trying to curb gun violence. Some schools are not waiting for the government to act. A school board in montpilier, ohio letting certain school staffers carry concealed guns, a move that was in the works before the sandy hook elementary school massacre. 
>> It's kind of scary to think about having gun in a school full of children. 
>> Although we felt we were doing a good job with keeping the doors locked, and making visitors sign in and all that, we felt as though it was time to take another step. 
>> No doubt, montpilier officials hope they can keep gunmen out of their buildings, but what if a gunman gets in? Here's miguel marquez with more. 
>> Lockdown, lockdown, lockdown. 
>> It's called active shooter training. 

[00:32:06]


>> Scenarios horrified. 
>> Don't run from me. 
>> A heavily armed mass killer all too possible. They use masks in this scenario to make this as real as possible. They use air guns, the gunman tried to get in through this door, the people in this room barricaded themselves in. Is it helpful, the scenarios, how realistic are they? 
>> They're absolutely realistic. Even though you know they're not real bullets. Immediately, I don't want to get shot at even if it's with a soft pellet gun. 
>> Reporter: Home to 30,000 students, a university has opened its doors to response options, a texas company teaching civilians sural skills for mass shootings. 
>> The lessons you're teaching are important? 
>> Yes. 
>> Why? 
>> What has been taught to them before has been shown not to work. 
>> What doesn't work is only trying to hide from a gunman. The company teaches other options like providing good information, barricading, escaping and in extreme situations, countering a gunman. 
>> Students at alabama's auburn university underwent the training here at san diego state, all incoming freshmen will undergo training. 
>> We want people to know what their options are before they happen, so they don't waste time figuring out what they're going to do next. 
>> Reporter: In 1996, graduate student frederick martin davidson stressed about defending his masters thesis killed three faculty members. Today seems everyone has a connectionblic shootings. Game edgemeyer's son now attends virginia tech where 49 people were killed or injured in that massacre. 
>> You have concerns about your child going to any college. At virginia tech, there was more concern. 

[00:34:10]


>> Reporter: Getting students and staff to think about the unthinkable, a hard reality. Cnn, san diego. 
>>> It amounts to an academic mutiny, some teachers in seattle refusing to give their students a required test. We'll tell you why and get a school administrator to weigh-in on that move by those educators.Our pharmacist recommended it. And that makes me feel pretty good about it. And then I heard about a study looking at multivitamins and the long term health benefits. And what do you know? They used centrum silver in the study. Makes me feel even better, that's what i take. Sorry, we take. 
[ Male Announcer ] CENTRUM. The most recommended. Most preferred. Most studied. Centrum, always your mt complete. 

[00:37:13]


>>> Teachers are boycotting a standardized test at a seattle high school. 19 teachers refused to give the measures of academic progress test after seattle's school district decided to factor the exam into teacher's evaluations. Teachers say the test is flawed. 
>> I'm happy to have anyone come in and look at my work. It's just that I don't think they should be tested by this te 
>> they adopted it for $4 million. Why would they adopt a test they haven't vetted? They haven't made sure is a line to our curriculum? I think there's a clear conflict of interest. 
>> The test is not required in washington state. Seattle public schools representatives have not commented on the uproar, noted school principal author and tv host steve perry is joining us live from hartford, concticut. Do the teachers have a point? 
>> No, they don't have a point. What they are trying to do is trying to skirt the responsibility of accountability. This examination like so many others probably has some flaws, as most examinations do. As the examinations that they give in their own classrooms do. If we look at some of the real data, we find that american students are at the bottom third in virtually every international comparison. All we do is depend upon the opinion of one teacher as opposed to a standardized examination. Which tells us what children can do. This particular test, we offer it in our school, and yes asthe teachers say, sometimes kids don't take this test seriously. It's a teachable moment. You explain h important the examination is, and work through them so they can begin to move forward. 
>> The teachers say they weren't given any sample test or test questions to get prepared for this test. Should that be done? 
>> It's a standardized examination, they're being tested on basic skills, this math test in particular, it gets harder as you answer more questions and easier as you answer less questions. The purpose of it is to provide a diagnostic examination. One in which at the end of the test, at the end of the examination we as faculty and staff can look at children's strengthens and weaknesses and put that in the curriculum. 

[00:39:39]


>> The teachers weren't opposed to the test until they realized it was going to evaluate them and their teaching ability. 
>> Shocker. Here we go again, right? Anything that's going to prove that they might need to do things differently, somehow is evil. Every single time they have an issue with a standardized examination, my question is this, where is yours, why don't you put forward an examination that you think is fair? Here's the point, there's more variation in a school between one english teacher and another english teacher than these standardized tests. One kid can take an english test with one teacher and get an a, take the test with another and get a b. 
>> As an administrator, what do you do in a case like this? You have an elected school board, you have administration in the school, and you have what amounts to a revolt by the teachers or 19 teachers at this high school. What should be done? 
>> To me, it's insub order nation. I don't see why people aren't getting fired? 
>> That's a quick answer. 
>> We'll see what happens in seattle. Thanks for joining us from hartford, connecticut. Appreciate it. 
>>> It sat in a new york park for years, kids probably played around that. People sat on it to take pictures. Who knew the whole time it was loads. Details next. lunch lunch?

[ Male Announcer ] THE DURABILITY OF THE Volkswagen passat. Pass down something he will be grateful for. TT THAT'S THE POWERrr OF GERMAN ENGINEERING. ?????? ?????? back to you. 
>>> This thing could have caused a major blast from the past literally. Preservation workers cleaning that revolutionary war era cannon the other day were shocked to see it was loaded with the cannonball and live gun powder. The cannon was mounted on display in central park for more than 100 years. 

[00:44:11]


>> It's an amazing surprise, it was there so many years, people were sitting on it when it was a loaded cannon. The cleaning crew called the bomb squad. A police spokesperson said yes in theory it could have been fired all those years it was on public display. 
>>> John f. Kennedy was not assassinated by a lone gunman, at least that was the belief of his brother, robert f. Kennedy, according to robert kennedy, jr. Speaking at a roundtable in dallas, kennedy said his father publicly supported the warren commission which said it was a lone gunman, but privately, his father was much more critical of the conclusion. His father thought there was strong evidence -- he asked the justice department to look into the connection between the assassination, the mafia, the cia and other organizations. The younger kennedy says his dad never publicly voiced those concerns, because he thought it would take away from the civil rights fight that was gripping the country. 
>>> The man practiced hail to the chief today for president obama's inauguration a week from tomorrow. 
>> There's the president now -- 
>> it was rehearsal with hundreds of band members, military personnel, media and law enforcement taking part. They used stand ins for the president and first lady. The military is getting ready to make sure everyone stays safe. 
>> On the morning of the inauguration the biggest move you'll see is in the pentagon southking lot, where they will screen all of the buses and parade participants. 
>> Washington, d.C., Expecting more than 500,000 people to attend the inauguration. Cnn is your home for complete coverage of the inauguration, starts next sunday morning.

What do you think? GEICO. Fifteen minutes could save you fifteen percent or more on car insurance. 

[00:50:24]


>>> It is one of the hottest films out right now, django unchained. It won a couple golden globe awards tonight, it's nominated for academy awards. While the film is making big bucks at the box office, it's the source of big controversy, quentin tarantino who is no stranger to violence and shock value may have gone too far. Nichelle turner takes a closer look. 
>> It's not your average spaghetti western. Django unchained special mix of slavery, comedy and violence has made a killing at the box office and blown away many in hollywood. 
>> Nobody better. 
>> I'm a big fan. 
>> Not everyone's a fan. 
>> Director spike lee told vibe tv he refused to see the film. Adding on twitter, american slavery was not a sergeo leone spaghetti western it was a holocaust. 
>> Well, he's absolutely right. 
>> Louis gossett jr. Imagines lee's version of the film. 
>> It would be more informative, more sensitive to its audience. 
>> It was only 15 minutes into django that gossett had enough. Enough of being the only black person in the theater. 
>> I had t go to another place so I could see it from beginning to end. 
>> By the end, he had heard the n word about 100 times in three hours. 
>> They used the n word too much. I'm close to the generation that was really touched by slavery and its mentality. I can give it credit for being brillian the. 
>> L.A. Reid echos that thought, he liked the film, but thought tarantino should have toned it down, saying, it's a painful part of america's history and still an open wound. But a wound that some say has a scab that is healing. 

[00:52:28]


>> I thought it was dope. I thought it was nice. You've never seen a film like that in that era of time portrayed that way, when you are a trailblazer, you can expect some extra criticism. 
>> That's what you want. You want it to be criticized, critiqued, people that are really talking about it. 
>> Now, even more people are talking about it. 
>> This is a slap in the face to our ancestors. 
>> Community organizers in los angeles called for a boycott against the film's action figures. 
>> This is highly offensive and we demand these dolls be pulled immediately. 
>> Calm down butch. 
>> No offense. 
>> And no offense intended. The weinstein company tells cnn in light of the reaction to the django unchained action figures we are removing them from distribution. They were meant to be collectibles for people 17 years and older which is the audience for the film. As the film's audience grows, so likely will the debate. In a country where most agree it's good to be free to disagree. 
>> Django unchained director said he was surprised to win best screenplay at the golden globe awards tonight. He got another golden globe for the movie, christophe walts. Hugh jackman won for his performance in les mis. He almost called the director and gavg up on the role, because he got so nervous during the rehearsals. His wife convinced him to stick with it.

The sea here off dana point thick with krill, squid food, the elusive creature, good sport fishing. They make a fine squid steak. They are bizarre shooting ink and water as they fight to stay in the sea. Out of the water they change colors. Sometimes like a traffic light.

>> Susan candiotti tonight in newtown, connecticut. Well, a weapon of an entirely different sort turned up in new york city. That's a revolutionary war canon. It was on public display in central park for more than 100 years. Workers cleaning it on friday realized it was led the entire time. There was a cannonball inside and live gun powder. 
>> This is an amazing surprise. It was there for so many years and people were sitting on it when it was a loaded canon. 
>> The cleaning crew called the bomb squad who disarmed the canon and everybody breathed a sigh of la rafe. A spokesman says in theory that canon could have been fired all those years it was on public display. 
>>> People are hunting pythons in florida today and they can win prizes. It's part of a month-long contest called the python challenge. Designed to tackle the problem of exploding python population. Our own john zarrella talked with a python hunter and a state officer about this contest. 
>> You can go out there for days and days and days and not see one python. I don't care how much experience you have. It is going to take some luck. 
>> If we remove one snake from the ecosystem, we've done a good thing. So imagine if 700 people are out there and they all bring one snake, that's 700 less snakes that we have out in the ecosystem. 
>> John zarrella is in the florida everglades with the latest on the python hunting contest. John? 
>> Reporter: I'm out here and this is a road that goes east/west and bisects the florida everglades between naples and miami. We've been out here for a couple hours looking for pythons, but at night the reason we're out here is because they like to come up by the road and take the warmth of that road off the pavement and that keeir bodies warm, their cold-blooded creatures. I'm joined by justin matthews. Weaver been out here with you. You're an expert, a wildlife expert trying to find these things, but the reality is we didn't get any, didn't find any, but that's to be expected. 

[00:08:58]


>> Yes, it is. Needle in a haystack. I would be surprised if we would have came out today and got a snake. 
>> And that's because it's been so warm lately. 
>> It's been so warm. They've been curled up. They've been, you know, hiding in the shade, in the thicket where people can't go, and chances are we've walked right by one today. 
>> Reporter: Didn't even see it. It's an invasive species. They're trying to get rid of them here. They're a real problem in florida, south florida especially, right? 
>> Yes, big problem. They're killing our native wildlife. And that's why we're here. We've run a wildlife rescue and we want to save native wildlife. 
>> Reporter: Good luck. There's a month of this hunt to go so you will be back. 
>> Definitely. 
>> Reporter: You will try to get some more. But the reality is, as justin was saying, it's like a needle in a haystack out here or anywhere. There's millions of acres of everglades and maybe there's 100, 150,000 of these snakes that are out here. That's at the top end. So it's really going to be interesting to see how many people over the course of the month catch snakes and how many actually are brought in in total.

>>> The u.S. Military has a new challenge to fight, the use of synthetic drugs. They're known as bath salts. Among the rank and file, it is a growing problem because the drugs are cheap, readily available, and don't always show up on drug tests. Here is our pentagon correspondent chris lawrence. 
>> Reporter: It's a shocking video in which an actor plays an american sailor high on bath salts. He sees other sailors as demons, punches his girlfriend, and gets wheeled into the er. Pinned down by paramedics.

On 2007 an army sergeant killed himself, his wife, and young son while he was high on bath salts. The naval academy kicked out 16 midshipman for using another drug spice. The military started random testing for synthetic last year, but it's hard to keep up with the science. 
>> But all the drug dealers, the chemists have to do is manipulate the molecule ever so slightly, you have a new drug, a new chemical that flies under the radar. 
>> Reporter: Since the u.S. Government banned the two main chemicals use in bath salts, another chemical started showing up, and it's ten times as potent as cocaine. Now, bath salts can't not be detected during a normal urinalysis, but just this week the navy started testing sailors and marines specifically for the drug. Chris lawrence, cnn, the pentagon.

Health officials in 47 states are reportingspread flu activity and several governors have set in motion public emergency measures. Here is our chief medical correspondent dr. Sanjay gupta. 
>> It's the worst flu season in years. Emergency rooms in many places are overflowing. It's a fast-moving story so here is what you need to know. 
>> Reporter: The flu strikes fast and symptoms much more severe than a common cold. You feel fine one day and then the next a sudden fever, sore throat, headache, and tightness in the chest.

>> Reporter: Flu cases are at epidemic proportions in some areas. 
>> They may get more colications from this particular strain which may make them ill for a longer period of time. 
>> Reporter: The active strain is h3n2. It typically surfaces earlier in the season and produces stronger symptoms and it is highly contagious. When someone coughs or sneezes, these tiny droplets are released into the air. You can't even see them in with the human eye. You can breathe them in but they can also live on surfaces. A lot of people don't realize this. They can stay on surfaces or eight hours. Say your co-worker is sick, you come over and use their keyboard, you have the germs on your hand and then you touch your nose or mouth. Now you're infected. And the problem escalates if you spend several hours in tight quarters like on an airplane. At highest risk, passengers two rows in front or behind of the infected person. The best way to kill those germs is to wash your hands and do it often, and use real soap and real water. The problem is most people don't actually wash their hands long enough. My best advice is sing the happy birthday song twice while you're washing your hands. That will be long enough. Another key to prevention is getting the flu shot. Getting vaccinated reduces your risk of getting the flu by around 60%. Another benefit to getting your flu shot is if you do get sick, your symptoms aren't likely to last as long and won't be as severe compared to those who weren't vaccinated.

>> Reporter: A survey by the public religion research institute conducted before the newtown shooting found 6 in 10 catholics support stricter gun control laws compared to about a third of white evangelical protestants and 42% of white mainline protestants. 
>> It's not just about theology, it's also about culture and geography. 
>> Reporter: The poll found white evangelicals are the most likely to own guns. Many live in southern around rural areas. What does the bible say about weapons? 
>> Christians are not to take weapons and avenge other people. However there's an affirmation that the government has a divine role to punish evildoers and so there's been tension. 
>> Reporter: With polls showing increased support for gun laws after newtown, could we see a shift among evangelicals? 
>> It may be a tipping point where most folks in those communities realize there are things we can do as a society to tamp down this kind of mass violence that doesn't require taking away everybody's guns. 
>> Reporter: Pastor darlings calling on members to support limits. 
>> The scriptures call us to love our neighbors more than we love our guns. 
>> Reporter: Still, some conservative christians say the focus shouldn't be on gunnings but on the environment giving rise to this violence.

>>> Vice president biden's proposals on reducing gun violence expected to address things like movies, video games, as well as mental health, but a potential new effort to reinstate the assault weapons ban is what has washington talking. Let's bring in cnn contributors lz granderson and anna navarro. Lz, let's assume the white house goes for this new assault weapons ban. The nra president told candy crowley this morning he doesn't think it will get through congress. You know, some studies show the last ban didn't work. Is it really worth all the effort? 
>> Absolutely. I mean, the studies also tell you why the last ban didn't work, because of all the look like hopes and the way the gun manufacturers were able to get around the restrictions that were put in place during the clinton administration. The thing about what vice president biden is going to unveil on tuesday is really interesting because there are three different conversations in my opinion that's happening in regards to guns. The first conversation is about mass shootings and what are we going to do about that. The second conversation is about the shootings that happen every other day in our streets, particularly like in chicago. And then there's a conversation about the culture of guns and that's where the movie violence and the video games comes in from. I'm really curious to see what vice president biden is going to unveil because those are three different conversations and you can't clean it all up with one fell swoop. 

[00:36:48]


>> Anna, I want to ask you about the strategy here because the president, if he goes for an assault weapons ban, will have to stus a lot of political muscle to do that and if you just look at the fbi statistics, although we have horrific events that occur with these guns sometimes, mostly it is pistols and handguns that are involved statistically in the crimes. If you are going to attack the murders in this country, you would attack those other guns. I'm wondering why you think it is that they'd lik to go after the ass weapons at this time. 
>> I think lz was exactly right. There is three different conversations going on and i think they have to turn it into one big comprehensive approach. If it's only framed as an assault weapons ban, it will have a very difficult time going through congress. But, yes, you know, the president is going to have to spend the capital. He has it and he's going to have to spend it. I'm sure vice president biden, who is now pregnant with this, this is his baby, and in case we haven't noticed, he's already running for president, is going to want something done. And the lem, drew, is the issue is not going away. As cnn was covering the meetings of the vice president on the issue, they had to break away because there was yet another school shooting going on at the same time. So every time there is a shooting and the sad reality is that these things will continue happening in all likelihood, the american people are going to ask what has been done newtown? That will become the new question. You see, this issue had been under the rug for the last four years. It had been awfully quiet despite all the different episodes we've had of shootings, but now the pandora box is open, and the expectation of the american people that something moves is much greater than it's been in the last four years. 
>> Yeah. 
>> And I think his only way of doing it is a comprehensive approach. 
>> Anna, to your point, senator chris murphy of connecticut says this assault weapons ban could pass this time because americans' attitudes on this have shifted since newtown. Since that one school shooting. Here is what he told candy crowley. 

[00:38:53]


>> I get it. The nra is going to use all their resources to try to stop this thing, but ultimately the people of this country have been transformed, and these assault weapons and they know it, these are not used by sportsmen. You don't need an assault weapon to kill a deer. You don't need an assault weapon to do target practice. Sportsmen are not going to have their rights abridged or their ability to enjoy their sport changed by having these dangerous military-style assault weapons taken off the streets. 
>> Anna, let me ask you because it's a republican sort of issue, did newtown really change the minds of republicans in the senate and the house on assault weapons? 
>> I think it has greatly affected the perception of the american people, and I believe it is the american people who are going to demand and get action on gun control, but if frame it as only a ban on assault weapons, it just really is doomed to failure. Now, the nra, drew, they're not stupid. They've been around for a long time. They are savvy political operators. If they see that it's going to pass, they're going to have to, you know, put in some other things. I think the way to frame this is that gun control and gun rights are not mutually exclusive. We can do both things. It's just going to require some crafty deal making and that's what joe biden and that's what leadership should be there about. But the american people are going to stay on this. The issue is not going away, sadly. 
>> Guys, let's turn the table here. I want to ask you about something else which is kind of exposed in a couple pictures this week if you watch closely on capitol hill today. The second term obama cabinet, his picks through john y, jack lew, chuck hagel. They're all white guys. Is the nation's first black president going to find some women or some minorities to join him? 

[00:40:58]


>> You know, when this conversation first started to percolate, I thought it was from the onion because it just didn't seem serious to me that we're really questioning whether or not president obama is an advocate of diversity. But I see now that it's not the onion, that it's actually real and we're actually having this conversation. I personally just think it's ridiculous. Especially when you consider what I think is the most important appointments -- appointment a president can make and that's to the supreme court because long after this administration is gone, those supreme court justices are going to be there shaping the laws of this country. And who did president obama pick? Not one but two women. Long after he's gone out of the white house those two women, those two appointees will be there. So this conversation about the president not being in support of diversity, the same person who pushed forward the overturning of don't ask, don't tell which affected, by the way, more women than men and more black women than white women, it's just -- to me it's just a silly conversation to be having. 
>> Lz, anna, we have to leave it there. Thanks for joining us.

[00:45:12]


>> Those pictures alone make me want to cough. Breathing seems like work let alone trying to get to work in these environmental conditions. But theial chinese state news agency xinhua came out today and said that the beijing environmental protection bureau has encouraged residents to stay indoors and really limit their exposure to the outdoors. You can see why. You have this dense shroud of pollution literally suffocating china's capital city. You have over 700 flights that were canceled this and drivers can't even drive without seeing what's in front of them. And if you want to go outside, don't leave without your gas mask. Not your gas mask, but your face mask I should say. 
>> Really? 
>> It's barely breathable conditions. Speaking of gas masks, a chinese dissident posed his own protest on facebook by posting this picture of himself wearing a gas mask. The tiny air pollution particles in diameter can measure a fraction of a hair, they get in your lungs and bloodstream and it can cause anything from respiratory disease to lung cancer to heart disease. The implications are really dire. And not to mention that the world bank says that out of the world's 20 most polluted cities, china has 16 of those cities. 
>> I know they tried to clean it up during the olympics but what is the cause? What's causing this? 
>> They absolutely . That's a really good point because that was really a temporary fix. It was like putting a band-aid on this bigger problem. You have this expanding rapidly growing population coupled with the fact they're primarily dependent on coal for their energy source and they're the world's biggest car market. You put all that in a pot, what do you get? You get a mess. That's what we're seeing right now. In terms of what the government is doing? They've acknowledged that. Whether or not this is going to be a long-term solution, you can't tell people to stay indoors all the time. There has to be a more permanent solution. In fact, we can see the smog carry into wednesday until winds come in and clear it out.

At other times when washington was an angry mess. Cnn'eed zakaria asked former statesmen and women what they would advise the president about his second term. 
>> Robert reuben was secretary of the treasury during another partisan time. How did you deal with republicans on the hill for something like the '97 budget agreement while they were trying to impeach president clinton? 
>> The partisan divide was bad in that period. I think it's worse today. In order to have a political system that's effective, I think we have to do exactly what president obid right after the election. 
>> I want to be clear, I'm not wedded to every detail of my plan. I'm open to compromise. I'm open to new ideas. I'm committed to solving our fiscal challenges. But I refuse to accept any approach that isn't balanced. 
>> In a democracy you can only move forward if both sides albeit having very different philosophical views are willing to come together and govern and that's what we've been lacking. Without it, I think we're going to be in terrible trouble. 
>> Much more advice to the president on farid za cara's s"memo to the president." 
>>> This past week a surprise move in baseball. This year there will be no new faces at the hall of fame. We've got a hall of fame voter to run all that down for you. 

[00:51:40]


>>> Well, baseball hall of fame voters pitched a shutout this week electing no one to join the elite in cooperstown. First time since 1996. A lot of new names on theallot from the so-called steroids era. Like barry bonds, mark maguire who broke some of the league's greatest records and linked to performance-enhancing drugs. Terrance moore is here to talk about, a hall of fame voter. 
>> Yes, sir. 
>> So are you glad people like bonds, sosa didn't get in? 
>> I'm elated. I didn't vote for of these knuckleheads that used steroids. Drew, on the hall of fame ballot it says you must consider integrity and character. That's integrity and character, doing that, and the one thing that makes my head want to explode which is would be an ugly sight, what about the bad guys in the hall of fame? 
>> First of all, I wasn't voting back then and second of all with that sort of logic you wouldn't have a third of u.S. Presidents in the history books with the slavery things and some of the bad things hearing about lately. 
>> Did that ballot always have the clause? 
>> Since 1936. The first hall of fame ballot, it was there. 
>> Bell, let's talk about pete rose. He's got a lifetime ban from baseball for gambling. He's also one of the greatest hitters of all time. Here's what don lemon, he asked him about the recent hall of fame vote. Here's what he said. 
>> I don't know if I 'll get in trouble for this. I have to defend roger clemens in this because until this day, he says he didn't take steroids and he's never fnked a drug test and he went in front of two different courts and they both ruled in favor of him. So, who am I to sit here and say he took steroids because he won some games after being 40 years? Bonds admitted he put the stert oids on him. Sosa flunked the test. Palmiero flunked the test. 

[00:53:42]


>> Well, true confessions. Okay? I personally have known pete rose for 35 years. He was my all-time favorite player growing up as a youth and s me to say this but pete is absolutely wrong about this. Okay? Roger clemens' best friend at the time andy pettitte said that he said he used steroids and backed out at the last minute talking to the feds and pete said numbers matter more so in baseball than any other sport. Baseball professionally since 1869. You have steroid use against mays and aarons in the history books not fair to those guys of the past when you lump these knuckleheads in with them. 
>> You know, steroid era lasted a while. 
>> It did. 
>> Could we see a repeat next year and the year after that? An era of these people not getting in. 
>> We're here in atlanta, georgia. Two former atlanta braves heroes, they're going to right the ship. They will be first ballot hall of famers. No steroidsthere. So, this will become a moot point. 
>> All right. Thanks a lot for coming in. 
>> Thank you. 
>> I know how you're vong now next year. 
>> Yes, sir. 
>> Terrific. 
>>> Want to hr more from what pete rose said? We have that for you tonight. He thinks about some of the biggest names in sports history being excluded from the hall. The comments at 10:00 eastern. 
>>> In virginia, there were fears of baby lion on the loose. Listen to this, terrance. It wasn't a lion. What it really was, that's kind of odd, too. Stick around. ?????? Hi dad.

>>> Some very startled people in virginia called 911 saying a lion was on the loose, roaming the streets. But it wasn't a lion. It was a labradoodle. Here's the story that only jeanne moos can tell. 
>> Reporter: We have seen a dog at a pet show in china made to look like a panda and a horse made to resemble a poodle. But this is the tale of a dog with such a convincing hair cut that people thought he was a lion and called 911. 
>> And there was a lion that ran across the street, a baby lion.

>> We start this hour with the latest on the flu epidemic that has gripped the nation. The cdc reports that 20 children have died, and we know from individual states that more than 100 adus are dead. With 47 states reporting widespread flu activity health officials say it is too soon to know if we are over the peak. In new york, governor cuomo has declared a public h emergency because of the flu and it clears the way to vaccinate children more easily. More than 19,000 flu cases have been diagnosed in new york alone. This is how the state commissioner described the number who had to be hospitalized. 
>> AS OF JANUARY 5th, THE STATE Health department received reports of over 2,800 patients hospital laboratory-confirmed influenza compared to 1,169 for all of last year. 
>> And it is not too late to get your flu shot just like governor cuomo is there. The cdc says that this year's vaccine is a good match for the flu strain going around. 

[00:02:11]


>> President obama paid a visit to the clinic at the pentagon this week, and don't worry, not for a case of the flu, but the white house says a routine fit ness evaluation, and the results will be released by the end of the month. The president's last exam in 2011 found the long-time smoker tobacco-free and consuming a healthy diet. 
>>> Moving overseas, ousted president hosni mew bark ra has won a trial for murders. The retrial will be based on the same evidence, but this time, judges will consider mubarak's health. The 84-year-old recently broke his ribs in a fall. Mubarak's trial, as you may recall drew the world's attention, because he was the first arab leader to p be jailed by his people, and because he appeared in court lying on a hospital bed and confined to a cage.

Universal backgroundcks and closing the gun show loophole, and the white house is believed to favor ban on assault weapons and high capacity magazines. Churches this sunday may focus on the guns, but not all of the sermons will have the sa message. It turns out that the christians are very divided over firearms. Cnn's athena jones has a look. 

[00:04:39]


>> Reporter: Gun control is front and center at the white house and a matter of debate among christians. 
>> There is a fascinating religious divide over the issue of gun control. 
>> Reporter: A survey by the research institute conducted before the newtown shooting found that 6 in 10 catholics support stricter gun control laws compared to one-third of white evangelical protestants and 42% of white mainline protestants. 
>> It is not just about theology, but about culture and theology. 
>> Reporter: And polls showed that white evan gels can mostly to own guns and most live in southern and rural areas where owning guns is the widest. What is the message? 
>> The message is not to avenge other people, but however, the government has a divine role to punish evil do-ers. 
>> Reporter: With polls showing increased support for ban on some guns. 
>> There is a message to tamp down the mass violence that does not mean taking away everyone's guns. 
>> Reporter: The pastor is calling for evangelicals to ban high capacity magazines and assault weapons. 
>> The scripture calls for us to love our neighbors more than our guns. 
>> Reporter: But some say the focus should not be on guns, but the reason for the violence. 
>> The nra poses a policeman in every school, the policy should be focused on getting a dad in every home. 
>> Reporter: Vice president biden said he is glad t evangelicals have participated in the meetings for the task force, because in the past, they have been reluctant to engage on the gun issue. Randi? 
>> Athena jones, thank you very much. 
>>> Tomorrow, lance armstrong is expected to sit down with with oprah winfrey at his home in texas, and he may finally spill the beeps. "Usa today" says he may admit to using performance enhancing drugs throughout his career. He has vigorously denied using drugs, but his fans are hoping to hear an admission and an apology. 

[00:07:06]


>> Better late than never. It is bad that he did it to start with, but come clean so to speak. 
>> Now that he is dropped from the cycling world, it won't hurt him, and this is going to soften up and maybe his admission of the he does admit it, it will bring him back into the cycling world. 
>> Of course, armstrong has not admitted to anything yet, and the interview with oprah is set to air on her network on thursday. 
>>> Relatives of computer proprogeny aaron schwartz say they are in shock after learning of his suicide. The 26-year-old hed himself in his brooklyn apartment. He helped develop rss when he was 14. He was facing federal fraud charges based on millions of stolen articles from m.I.T. He had denied the claims. 
>>> It is unseasonably warm in parts of the south, and in fact, 76 degrees in atlanta yesterday broke the previous record of 75 degrees dating all of the way back to 1890, but it is a much different story out west. In phoenix, a freeze warning is in effect until tuesday while overnight temperatures in central california hovered in THE LOW 20s THREATENING CROPS. 
>> Right now, we are probably two weeks from the the end of our harvest, so maybe 15 to 20% of the crop would be lost. 
>> Meanwhile in spokane, washington, and take a look, no, this is not a parking lot, but a fresh layer of snow that turne one road to ice and sent nearly 20 cars crashing into each other. In reno, nevada, roads are so icy that traffic is backed up for hours and troopers are are responding to dozens of accidents there. And take a loat the white-out. It is in north dakota, and the department of transportation there warning the drivers to go slowly or just stay inside. That might be better. The expected high today in minot, north dakota, zero. 

[00:09:07]

>> The common notion is that things that are equall to the same thing are equal to each other. 
>> Daniel day-lewis playi lincoln there, and to discuss tonight's awards I am joined by "us week" "editor bradley jacobs and a-lister john murray columnist, and big night tonight and I know you are excd. So let's talk about the most hosts tonight, I know a lot of people are excited about tina fey and amy pohler hosting, and I know they have put together a drinking game. Bradley, how do you think they will do? 

[00:13:33]


>> I can't wait to see them together, because I love the movies together, "baby mama" and "mean girls" and yes, I'm ready to drink every time a actress gets choked up every time she thanks the hairstylist and not the husband. These two are a riot and the tongue is firmly planted in cheek, and they are perfect hosts and they might dial it back a little bit from ricky gervais and all of the things that got him in trouble a couple of years ago. 
>> Yes, they have a great sense of humor together, john, and how do you think they will do? 
>> Well, I think, randi, the double for the trouble and lucy hel and "lavern & shirley". I think that robert downey, jr. Not partake, and lindsay lohan, because of their troubles, but it is going to be light-hearted comedy. 
>> Let's get to the movies. For the best movie, "lincoln" is a lot of the talk, and bradley, who will take it home? 
>> Absolutely. Of course, daniel day-lewis for the method portrayal of abraham lincoln. I was reading that daniel was in character the entire time and it wasn't until the movie, the very last take was finished that he actually thanked steven spielberg this the actual english accent and it made steven cry, because for months and months, he was abraham lincoln and that resonates throughout the film. It is a class a performance this is unbeatable. 
>> Does he have any competition, john, as a movie, in terms of the drama? 
>> If anything else wins in that category, it is the upset of the night because "lincoln" has great momentum and I think it is going to take home the prize. 
>> And what about tv? That is a big category at the golden globes, and john, for this one, who is your pick for best tv show, drama and comedy? 

[00:15:36]


>> "Downton abbey" and you know, I consider myself a british rock star in a former life, but for a comedy, "modern family" and people are in love with this show, and it is breaking all of the rules d broken all of the stereotypes and it is the new format for comedy on television. 
>> What about "homeland," bradley? 
>> Well, I have two picks. For draw marks you will see "homeland" win, and "downton abbey" is still too small to win, but "homeland" has all of the buzz in this category for the second year in a e row, and I can't hear enough good things about it. And then in the comedy department though, I'm going with "girls" this year, because it has been my favorite show of the last year, and "modern family" has won a bunch of shows and now it is time forsomething fresh. Lena dunham came up with something new, and it took ten years to come up with "sex and the city" and she came up with it, and it is not "sex and the city" but it is totally enjoyable, and you will see that win tonight and maybe lena as well. 
>> Yes, she is so talented. What about the golden globe, because it is so much more of a party than the oscars. 
>> Well, that is the joy of it. 
>> John, you go. 
>> Well, ricky gervais put it best, and he said golden globes are to the oscars as kim kardashian is to the oscar. 
>> Well, this whole sthing a different animal. You are sitting at tables and all hobnobbing with each other and much more relaxed. The oscars is super uptight, and basically every guest at the oscars has his or her own security person with them, and at the golden globes, it is a different story. Much mmellow and relaxed and it comes out in the speeches as well. People are lighter and looser and drop an f-bomb here and there and it is much more, much more fun for the series as well, and that is why I think that seth MacFarlane is trying to capture a little bit of that for the oscs this year, and we will see if if it works for him. 

[00:18:05]


>> We pay attention not only to the nominee, but what they are wearing and fashion is a huge part of the show. From what I have read, it sounds like emerald green is supposed to be a big color this year. John, what do you expect in terms of fashion this is. 
>> Well, I just don't want to see all of the guys in black tuxedos and joan rivers and the fashion police love the guys in the traditional look, but I like guys like jamie foxx and ryan e seacrest and others show up for the show and shake it up a little bit. I want the guys in color and the women, they can do whatever they want to do. 
>> And bradley? 
>> As far as women are concerned, nobody does it better than sophia vergara and ever since "modern family" has been on the air, she has been blowing the fashion editors at "us weekly ""up for what she wears, and also what angelina jolie did with her dress and the legs, and what she did created a new twitter feed. 
>> Yes, it has its own twitter feed, angelina jolie's leg. That is right. 
>> And the fashion is more than half of the fun as far as the editors of "us" are concerned, because that is what really matters and we devote pages and pages to it. 
>> Yes, we certainly look for that, no question about it. Bradley jacobs of "us weekly" and john, thank you. The golden globes red carpet starts at 6:00 p.M. And you can watch it right here on cnn. 
>>> One woman has a new tiara and we will tell you which state can claim this year's new miss AMERICA.Everyone tells a little white lie now and then. But now she wants my recipe 
[ clears his throat ] [ softly ] She's right behind me isn't she?

Come to walmart and see for yourself. Find rollbacks on the contact lenses you want. Like the acuvue oasys -- now $27.88. Walmart. >>>Welcome back, 22 minutes past the hou, and we are glad you are with us. It is official we have a brand new miss america this morning. 
>> Your new miss america is miss new york. 

[00:23:07]


>> Mallory hytes hagan and the laime miss new york won the crown was 1984, and that winner was vanessa williams. 
>>> And did you catch this playoff game yesterday? Joe flacco and the bray ravens knocked off the denver broncos yesterday. It was super exciting. Baltimore has a tough game next week facing off with the inwer of the patriots/texans game. AND YESTERDAY THE 49ers SEALED Their spot in the nfc title game running over long time rivs the packers 45-31. Colin kaepernick led san francisco setting a new record for ing yards by a quarterback in any game regular season or post-season and he scrambled for 181 yards. The niners will play either the seahawks or the falcons next sunday. 
>>> And while football is not your thing, maybe hockey is. The new season starts next saturday. Yes, they have inked a deal after a threef-month lockout. It will be a short season, 48 games down from usual 82. Training camps open today. 
>> All right. Forget lance armstrong or the gun debate or the oscars, here is a sports story that comes from a half mile under the ocean. The first ever pictures of a giant squid in its natural habitat. Take a look here. The ten-foot find was touted as one of the most important discoveries in decades. But in california, they don't have time to talk about giant squids, instead, they have their own fishing frenzy. Our miguel marquez has more. 
>> Reporter: It is a southern california squid frenzy. 
>> Up and over. There we go. 
>> Reporter: Every night fishing boats packed to the gills set off to hunt for two to three-foot long and sometimes bigger squid. The sea here off of dana point thick with creel, squid food, and the elusive crs are a great sport fishing and make a fine squid steak, but they are bizarre shooting ink in water as they fight to stay in the sea. When out of the water, they change colors, and sometimes like a traffic light. 

[00:25:27]


>> This is what the squid hunters have come after, humboldt squid, and look at that. There's the eye there, and the teeth are right in here, and if I stuck my hand in there, they grab me and change colors and amazingly somebody grabbed a hold of this one, and you can see a perfect hand print on that squid right there. The humboldt or the flank squid makes its home from alaska to south america, and it is rare and very rare to have so many squid off of the coast here for so long offering such great fishing or squidding. The captain of the "sun fun" knows the waters well and tonight, he is the only guy who knows precly where the skid are. Those from miles around hover hoping for a sqbonanza. 
>> In is just awesome. 
>> Reporter:2013 is shaing up to be the year of the squid. The giant squid, a distant cousin of the humboldt was seen for the first time in its natural habitat 2,000 feet down off of the coast of japan. Squid is not just for breading and deep frying anymore. In popular culture, the squid agenda is alive and wed bent on world domination. You see it in "monsters versus aliens." 
>> I come in peace and I will do no harm, and you will all die. 
>> All hail galaxar, viva la squid. 
>> Hat's off to miguel marquez for touching that thing. Quite brave of him.

>>> Welcome bck to cnn's sunday morning, I'm randi kaye and glad you are with us. Bottom of the hour now and here are some stories we are watching now. We are in the middle of a deadly flu epidemic. The cdc says that 47 states are reporting wide activity and though the severity has lessened, they say that 20 children have died.

>>> For today's "faces of faith" we are talking about the washington national cathedral and it is the so-called spiritual home of the nation, and four presidents have been inaugurated there, and four national monuments are there. And this has also been a new site for same-sex marriages. The reverend for the national cathedral is david hall and i asked him about this issue and his own evolution of the issue? 
>> I worked at all saints in pasadena, california, and it is a big urban church in the los angeles area, and has a large gay and lesbian population and also an aids service center, and in those years, I really came to know the gay and lesbian people as my friends and colleagues, and as parishioners. I, because of the aids service center, we had many people who in those years were dying of aids and I got to see the families and couples, and, you know, men and women in these stressful situations and saw the extent to which they loved and supported each other. I really began to see that if the love that I saw in those hospital rooms and in th homes was not real love that the church should bless then i didn't know what was. It was a transformational time for me. 
>> Yes, a real impact. 
>> Yes. 
>> And you have said that straight couples can learn from same-sex marriages, and what do you mean by that? How so? Sh. 
>> Well, I think that, you know, heterosexual marriage and I'm married myself and I have been married for 35 years, and very happily so, and my marriage has really taught me a lot about life and god and the world. And I would say that both kathy, my wife and i, and all straight couples have to do some work to make our relationships as equal and mutual as they can be. I do think that one of the things that we learned from gay and lesbian couples in same sex couples and same-sex marriages that it is radically mutual and radically equal. Both partners really come to that relationship as equals. There is not the sort of male, female vestiges of hierarchy that straight people have to still deal with in our marriages. The new same-sex rite is based in baptism and again which is a sacrament of radical equality in the tradition. 

[00:35:12]


>> Are you concerned at all that e embracing a controversial issue at the national cathedral of all places will be divisive? Does that worry you? 
>> Well, the national cathedral is a public church. Really, for many years, it has had a history of taking positions on important social issues. One of my great ecessors ma this the civil s era, and martin luther king jr. Preached in the pulpit there of the national cathedral, and the national cathedral has had history of engaging major policy issues. 
>> But some critics say that the church is bucking thousands of years of religious tradition and the teachings of the bible, and how do you see it? 
>> Well, the bible and I wrote and I edited a book of esss about this, so I have been thinking about this issue for a long time. You know, the bible doesn't speak with one voice about marriage. I mean, the bible has several visions of what marriage can be. One man, one woman ends up to be the late version, but earlier versions included marriage where if a man died, his brother would marry the widow and before that, polygamy, so it is not like the bible speaks with a unified voice and the church sees that the marriage has evolved over the years, and we have moved to a much more equal and egalitarian place about men and women in the 20th and the 21st centuries, but it was not that long ago where women were swearing to love, honor and obey their husbands. And so, our teaching about marriage has evolved in the scriptures and in the tradition and offering faithfulf gay and lesbian people this disparate opportunity to live their lives faithfully as we have offered to heterosexual men and women is the next step of our teaching of marriage. 

[00:37:30]


>> Do you see this move as starting a trend for other denominations? 
>> Well, I think that the episcopal church and the unitarian church and the united church of christ have been in the forefront of this issue. Our hope is that we are both an episcopal institution as the national cathedral, but we are mindful of our role as a kind of sacred space for the nation. So my hope is that we can use our visibility to advance this issue further, and really to be a model for other faith communities in the country. 
>> Reverend gary hall, dean of the national washington cathedral and thank you for your time this morning. 
>> It is a real pleasure, thank you. You're welcome.

>>> "Usa today" is reporting cyclist lance armstrong may admit to doping this week. I will tell you when to expect that bombshell announcement next. But when I started losing energy and became moody... That's when I had an honest conversation with my doctor. We discussed all the symptoms... Then he gave me some blood tests. Showed it was low t. That's it. It was a number -- not just me. 
[ Male Announcer ] TODAY, MEN WITH LOW T Have androgel 1.62% (testosterone gel). The #1 prescribed topical testosterone replacement therapy, increases testosterone when used daily. Women and children should avoid contact with application sites.

Men with breast cancer or who have or might have prostate cancer, and women who are or may become pregnant or are breastfeeding, should not use androgel. Serious side effects include worsening of an enlarged prostate, possible increased risk of prostate cancer, lower sperm count, swelling of ankles, feet, or body, enlarged or painful breasts, problems breathing during sleep, and blood clots in the legs. Tell your doctor about your medical conditions and medications, especially insulin, corticosteroids, or medicines to decrease blood clotting. So...What do men do when a number's too low?

A lot ofople paying attention to that. Also on tuesday, we will talk about sandy relief and expected vote on $50 billion of super storm sandy relief money going to take place on tuesday.

And as that one-month mark from the shooting of newtown approaches as I just mentioned, the community is reflecting on the tragedy there. Cnn's national correspondent susan candiotti has more. 

[00:43:13]


>> Reporter: Good moring, randi. Wounds are are fresh here in newtown, and yet the community continues to find ways to help each other heal. The touching memorials that we are all familiar with are gone, but they will serve a new purpose, toys and candles and much more are being mulched and preserved to become part of a permanent memorial one day. Meantime, a makeshift memorial marked by a american flag has been set up by one of newtown's main roads and we are asked to keep a respectful distance and we are. It is created by a local businessman, and it is a tent with lots of momentos from all over the world where people can come inside and reflect. Today, a public meeting planned for future plans of sandy hook elementary. S are attending another school now. And there is also going to be a debate on gun control where we are expected to see some relatives of sandy hook. Randi?

>>> The u.S. Treasury department will not mint a $1 trillion platinum coin to avoid default ing on the nation's debt. For weeks people have speculated that the coin could be a loophole if congress does not pass the debt ceiling. . It has been less than one month since the tragic shooting at sandy hook elementary in connecticut and the country is deeply divided over the issue of gun control, and the deadline is approaching for vice president joe biden to representative his recommendations to the president which should happen tuesday. Cnn's candy crowley is taking up the debate in today's "state of the union" and candy, i understand that you have a pretty outspoken guest on the show. 
>> Well, a couple of them. David keene who is the president of the national rifle association and also we will talk to the new senator from connecticut chris murphy and i spoke to him a month ago up there on the scene at newtown, and then we want to try to take a look of this from a bipartisan approach if that is possible. There is a new group forming with senator joe manchin who is a democrat from west virginia and jon huntsman who was a presidential candidate a moderate who is trying to form this group to form bipartisanship, and is that possible anymore? We want to look at gun debate through the prism of bipartisanship and is that at all possible? 
>> Do you believe they will come to some type of agreement here, because certainly a lot of issues on the table? 
>> Yes. I think that there are a lot of issues on the table, so, I think that there areome things that the white house is prepared to do in tes of making the background checks more effective and laws in place to fund more of the money for some of the background check, and tighten up the sort of mental health background check, and try to help states comply a little bit more, but in terms of the big things, that is, what about the magazine clips that can fire so many bulls at the, you know, one right after the other in rampant fire, and what about the assault weapons ban? I don't know. We will see a little bit more coming up, because we do expect in the assaults weapon ban to be introduced in the senate this week, but I don't -- yes, it is different, p but I'm not sure at this moment with all of the things on their plate that an assault weapons ban is something that congress will be able to do. So certly, the president says he will push it, and when you look at the other things, and the school safety and look at mental health help for those who are in trouble, and when you look at all of those things, like the society and the culture and the video games, and it is just hard and these are all terrible, but when come to do it, it kind of falls apart in the details. 

[00:51:14]


>> Yes, it seems that the universal background check and the limited magazine capacity might be a little bit easier. Candy, thank you. We will be watching. 
>> Thanks. 
>>> Keep it here for "state of the union" which starts in about nine minutes at 9:00 a.M. Eastern time right here on cnn.

[00:54:58]


>>> Welcome back, everyone. Entertainment news now, and the bad blood between bill maher and donald trump took a bizarre turn this week as we take a look at the clip from "the tonight show." 
>> The color of his hair -- 
>> yes. 
>> And the color of an orange or rang tang are the only two things in nature of the same color. I'm not saying it is true, but i hope it is not true, but unless he comes up with proof, I'm willing to offer $5 million to donald trump -- 
>> $5 million for trump to prove that he is not an orangutan, and that is his flame thrower to trump over the birther movement, and all fun and games, right? No, but then trump sent a copy of his birth certificate to bill maher and told him to pay up. He says, I hope bill maher comes through with his $5 million offer, which I fully accepted orally be forced to sue him. All goes to charity. What do you think of this dino abdallah? Is this real? Is. 
>> I don't think that donald trump is a human being and from another planet and he is lead ing the birther unit and I am leading the trumper unit and people do not believe he is an orangutan, but he was left here by alis at some point. And donald trump, the man is billionaire and owns hotels and buildings, and bill mahehe is a comedian and people tell jokes and then people laugh. If you don't like the jokes, then ignore them. Bill maher is a villain in a james bond movie to wipe out comedy, and it is unseemly for a guy who has done everything unseemly. This is the lowest he has gone. 
>> That is the comic background there, but as a former lawyer, he does not have a case here against mar? 

[00:57:07]


>> Well, no, one of the first elements of a contract is an offer, and the offer has to be intent to enter into the contract, and bill maher is saying right before this fake offer, y are the son of an orangutan and you comedic. And people say all of the time, I will pay to see that, and them you have to be in court to defend a lawsuit against that. That is ridiculous. And donald tru publicity. 
>> Let meuess, this is another attempt at publicity. 
>> Donald trump loves publicity and nobody loves that more as much as he is divisive and bill maher is a great publicity hound, and hound is a nice word and not dirty, but they are cut from similar ends of the cloth and come at it from different points of view, but they love the press, these two. 
>> And he does say that if he did get paid, trump this is, he tweeted that the money would go the charity and among other things, the police athletic league new york, march of dimes, hurricane sandy victims and that sounds nice, but I'm curious, if you have ever been sued or gotten into legal trouble for teing a joke or calling someone a orangutan. 
>> I hope that if trump is watching this, I will be in court and in all of the headlines. I will be huge. I do political jokes and jokes about social isss and race issues, and I have been called a lot of names on twitter and especially people get angry and people on the far left and the far right have something in common, because if they don't agree with the joke, they will attack you and tell you it is not funny and youare an idiot and the people this the middle get it is a joke, and people on the extremes, and donald trump on the far right has no seps of humor. I see it all of the time. 
>> What is your advice for the donald? 
>> Get a better hairpiece is nice. Have thick skin and he is so thin skinned for a man with a face like leather, and let it go. If someone tells a joke, laugh at it and smile at least, but if not, ignore it, donald and go into one of the hous or the big hotels and enjoy your life. You are a billionaire. 

[00:59:14]


>> I bet you anything that he will send you a copy of the birth certificate any day now to prove it. 
>> I will send him mine to prove that I am a human being born in the united states of america. 
>> And it sounds like if you look at the example quickly, but it is like coming to the point where the comedians have to be concerned about what they say. 
>> Well, there is a concern about the freedom of expression, and I'll be honest with you, the more better known you are like bill maher, there are more limitation, because if you say something wrong or inappropriate, you are in the media the next day to defend yourself, and lesser known, it is not so seous, but this is a

Oh... Captioning sponsored by Nbc/universal (munching) (George chattering) (slurps) Narrator: Breakfast was George's favorite meal of the day... along with lunch and dinner. (chewing noisily) George, could you pass the pepper, please? (puzzled chattering) (chatters happily) (grunts) Oh. (sniffs) Uh-oh. Pepper always made George... (sneezes) Aah! ...sneeze. Uh, are you all right? Uh-huh. (giggles) (laughs) That's some mess you made. I'll go get the sponge-- ooh, except I'm late for a meeting. I have to go. Can you clean up, George? (chattering) Uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh. Thanks, and make sure to vacuum up all the crumbs. I saw an ant in here a few days ago. Ah! (hooting excitedly) Uh, no, George, that's a bad thing. Ah! (hooting seriously) Yes, once ants discover food in an apartment, you can never get rid of them-- never. Ooh. 

[00:04:02]


(door opens) Bye, George, have a nice day. (chatters "Good-bye") (groans) George had made quite a mess... even for a monkey. (grunting) (cheers) Look at that. A new game-- grapeball. (hoots) Before long, George had invented a lot of new games-- grapeball, appleball, pearball... and now toastball. (gasps) That was close. George almost stepped on an ant. Oh! Wait, an ant? The Man with the Yellow Hat was right. Therewas an ant in the apartment. Huh? There were two ants in the apartment. (chatters "Hey") Uh-uh. (screams) (panicked chattering) Actually, there re a lot of ants in the apartment. Uh-oh! George had to stop the ants from finding the food. Aha. Huh? George discovered that ants are good at walking over things. (screams) (grunts) (sighs) Huh? Ants are good at walking around things, too. (worried groaning) George would need something bigger to block all these ants. (exclaims) (panting frantically) (grunts) (groans) Meanwhile, Hundley was outside checking the hallway, making sure it looked nice and tidy. (George screams, Hundley barks) (yelling) 

[00:06:03]


(puzzled grunt) An ant? That's not tidy. (barking) (yelling) George was up to something. Hundley decided he'd better check. Just as Hundley suspected. (grumbles) George was having an ant party. George wanted Hundley to help him keep the ants away from the food. (yells) Too late. (groans) (groaning sadly) Now George would never get rid of them. Never. (groans) Hmm. (growls) (barks) (sniffing) (barks) (exclaims) Was that where the ants were coming from? Aha. If George could carefully block the crack, the problem was solved. George was a genius. Except now he'd have to stay here forever. (sighs) Aha. (chattering) (barks) (panting) (chatters "Yeah") George had done it. No more ants. (both cheering) (sighs) Huh? Where were these coming from? (both groan) (George chattering) It took a lot of napkins and other stuff, but George and Hundley plugged every crack. No more ants could get in. Aha! (howls) (gasps) (grunts) Now they just had to get 

[00:08:03]


all the ants that were already in... out. George was amazed that the ant could carry something almost as big as it was. (barking gibberish) Hundley didn't want to study ants. He wanted to get rid of them. (puzzled grunt) (barking enthusiastically) Maybe the vacuum cleaner would scare them away. (Hundley grunts, George screams) (whirring) (barking) It scared Hundley... (whirring stops, George chatters) ...but the ant seemed to be just fine. George decided the ant might feel safer out on the balcony. (chatters) Maybe that's what George should do-- carry all the ants outside. (panting) All one gajillion of them? That wouldn't work. (hooting excitedly) (groans) (George chattering) Aha! (laughs) George showed Hundley his discovery... (chattering) ...ants follow food. Maybe they'd follow it right out the door. Ah. Uh-huh, uh-huh. (giggles) So that was the solution-- put the food outside and the ants would leave. (hooting) (both cheering) (chatters sadly) And, of course, they come back with their food. (puzzled grunting) (both groan) 

[00:10:03]


Hmm... George had another idea. Maybe he could get the ants inside the trash can by filling it with food. Ah. (grunts) (grunts) (hooting) (chatters) The ant trap was ready. (snickers) It was working. The ants crawled into the can as fast as their legs would carry them. (excited chattering) (howls) Uh-oh. (excited chattering) (chuckles) Uh-uh. (blowing repeatedly) George had to get the ants out of the apartment fast, before they escaped. Yeah! The ants were outside-- problem solved. Except... now they had a new problem-- where would they put them? (sniffing) (barking) They couldn't put the ants on the sidewalk-- they'd get squished. And they'd get even more squished on the street. Ah... The park. The ants would love it there. Ah... (spitting) (excited chattering) (chattering) (barking) Hey! Hundley was a small dog, but he made a very big noise. (barking) Ooh! What's going on there? Hey! (Hundley barking, people gasping) 

[00:12:05]


(excited chattering) Whew! All right! All right! George and Hundley set the ants free in a nice, empty area of the park, where no one would step on them. (chattering "Good-bye! Good-bye!") George said good-bye to each and every ant. (George continues chattering "Good-bye! Good-bye!") (whines) This could take a while. (whines) (George continues chattering "Good-bye!") It had been quite a morning. But the ants were gone, and everything was okay. George! I can't believe this apartment! (groans) George had forgotten to clean up his mess. Good job, George. Not only did you clean the apartment, you also took out the trash. He did? Hey! Oh, yeah. He did. (laughs) Of course, you also shoved napkins and handkerchiefs into the wall and covered it with bandages. But... I'm not even gonna ask. Ah. (laughs) You just sit down and take it easy. I'll go make us some lunch. (chattering happily) (sighs) George could finally relax. The apartment was clean, and he'd never have to worry about ants again. (gasps) Uh-oh. Child: George is a monkey. He and Hundley learned some things about ants. GIRL: We are raising beetles for the Neponset River Watershed Association. These plants are called purple loosestrife. It's a plant that doesn't belong here, and there isn't room for the plants that aresupposed to grow here. We are raising beetles 

[00:14:05]


to eat the purple loosestrife, to help plants and animals that live in this wetland. These are the galerucella beetles that eat the purple loosestrife. You guys are gonna go home with your bags of beetles. And you snake this over the stakes, and then real carefully, you let the bugs go inside your netting. Boy: And they love this plant, because that's what they really eat. Girl: Today at Fowl Meadow, we are releasing the beetles. They only eat the loosestrife, so they won't damage any other plants that are supposed to be here. Girl: I think it's a good thing that kids want to help the plants and the environment, and the animals grow. Narrator: George enjoyed all mornings the country, but Sunday was his favorite. Because Sunday was pancake day. Ah! See how it's getting bubbly? That means they're ready to flip. Ah! Mm! (pancakes sizzling) (shouts) Ha! Good job! Ha-ha-ha! (chatters) Man: Whoa, whoa, go easy on that syrup. It doesn't grow on trees. Well... actually, it does. Aw... ha! (chuckles): No, really, it does. Trees? That grow syrup? George couldn't wait to pick some. I mean, it's not onthe tree. It's inthe tree. You have to tap it. Ah. (knocking) Ah! (giggles) (giggling) Oh! Uh-oh. Oh. That's okay. I like my pancakes without. 

[00:16:06]


(phone rings) I'll get it. Eat 'em while they're hot and soggy. Oh. (gulps) Ah... Wait. They weren't out of syrup. They had plenty of trees. All he had to do was tap them. Uh-huh! (knocking) (chattering) Hmm. Allie: George, why are you knocking on that tree? (chattering) Huh? There's a door in there? Really? Oh! Maybe this is where elves live. Uh-uh. (loud tapping) Huh? Narrator: Sothat was the problem. George needed to tap louder. Hey! And to borrow that mallet. (chatters) George, what are you doing? (chatters) Are you looking for syrup? Uh-huh, uh-huh. Well, first you'll have to tap the tree. (chattering) (laughing) No. Not tap like knocking. I mean a tap like a spigot. (chatters) See, you put a tap in the tree, and then collect the sap in a bucket. Ah... Yeah! You know... I've got an extra bucket if you'd like to make your own syrup. (excited chattering) Wow, George! You get a whole bucket? How many pancakes could you cover with that? 

[00:18:08]


Ooh! Heh! Ah. George wasn't sure... but he bet it was a lot. (chuckles) Good job! Ha-ha! You want to try? Uh-huh! Great! Making syrup is easy. First you have to find a maple tree. Now, a maple tree has gray bark and deep ridges that run up and down like this, and they have five-pointed leaves, like this. Oh. Yeah, look-- the bottle tells you what kind of leaves to look for. Ah! (grunts) Then you drill a small hole, angled up, for best sap flow, then hammer in the spigot. (excited chatter) (laughing): No, no. It doesn't hurt the tree, George. Right now it's like the trees are sleeping. They don't need their sap until spring, when the weather gets warmer and they put out leaves. (grunts) Got it? Ah, uh-huh! Now, hold on. You'll need these, too. I'll get another set from the barn. You sure you don't want any help? Uh-uh. Nope. Okay. Bye-bye! (laughing): Yay! (chattering excitedly) Oh, yeah, that one's good and gray. Some trees were gray... Oh. ...but didn't have deep up-and-down ridges. The bark's wrong. (gasps) Others had ridges, but weren't gray. (George groans) Uh-uh. (chatters "Yeah") (hooting happily) Uh-huh. But some trees were just right. 

[00:20:10]


(grunting) Here you go, George. (cheering) We did it. Now all we have to do is wait. (groans) (sighs) I think we tapped the slowest tree in the woods. Uh-huh. (chatters) Thanks, George. Hey, George. It took a while, but George's bucket was finally full. Ooh. (laughs) Whoops-- wait, I'll help you. (grunts) We need a bucket-lifting machine or an elevator. (cow moos) Or a cow. (gasps) George figured, with Leslie's help he could lift the bucket off the tap. (grunts) Ready? One, two... (grunting) Whoops. It wasn't a whole bucket of syrup, but it would still cover a lot of pancakes. Moo. Forgot to turn the tree off. 

[00:22:13]


(laughs) Cwme on. Okay, okay. (chatters "Ta-da!") Pancakes for me? Uh-huh. Yep, and syrup-- and we made it. Well, the tree made it, but we tapped the tree all by ourselves. Wow. (gulps) Very... moist. (chattering) Ugh! (spitting) (gibbering) Ech! Oh, that doesn't taste like syrup at all. Grandpa's trees must be broken. MR. RENKINS (chuckling): No, no, no. The trees aren't broken, George. Maple syrup trees give sap, not syrup. tters) Sap? Sap becomes syrup after it's boiled down. Luckily, you've come to the right place. We boil it right here at the sugar shack. Oh, yeah. Now, this will take a while, and if we leave it too long, it can boil over, burn, and be ruined. (concerned chattering) So we have to keep an eye on it. Uh-huh, uh-huh-huh. Watching sap boil was a lot like watching sap drip. It took forever. Mr. Renkins: Aha, looks like it's ready. What do you say to that? Oh, yeah. (chattering happily) Leslie: Moo... (gasps) Huh? Moo... Leslie. Moo... Moo... How did you get out? Moo... Whoops. I think she wants syrup. Cows like syrup a lot. (Mr. Renkins grunting) 

[00:24:16]


Huh? (gasps) George, the syrup. It's going to boil over. Narrator: No matter how hard he blew, George couldn't cool the syrup down. (grunting) Leslie. Huh? Maybe if they fanned it. (George grunts) (laughs) (chattering) Huh? Oh. I thought you didn't know anything about making syrup. (chatters) Well, you knew butter stops syrup from boiling over. Huh? Oh. Well, here you are-- your own bottle of syrup. (chuckles) It takes a whole lot of sap to make a little bit of syrup. Uh-huh. (chatters "Good-bye") Bye-bye. (smacks lips) Mmm, mmm, thanks, George. Best syrup ever. (laughs) Rrator: Luckily, a little bit of syrup has a whole lot of taste. Child: sap has to be made into syrup before you can eat it. We are learning how dark chocolate is made at the Taza Chocolate Factory. We think about chocolate as food, because dark chocolate has some good nutritional qualities. This is the fruit of a cocoa tree, and it's filled with the cocoa beans that we use. GIRL: Chocolate is made from the cocoa nibs, which were inside the beans. Mike: This machine grinds the nibs with stones. It comes out as cocoa paste. 

[00:26:19]


Bleh! MIKE: Just like when George tapped the tree, same thing here-- it doesn't taste very good until we add sugar. Girl: They add sugar, but not a lot. LARRY: This chocolate has only three ingredients-- cocoa beans, sugar, and vanilla-- and they are all organic. Mike: The chocolate is put into a mold, it cools down and then we have a chocolate disk, ready to eat. BOY: It's really fun to learn how it's made. Announcer: Coming to pbs kids, a world premiere event! Blowfish blowout! Earth to kratt brothers. Come in, kratt brothers. Announcer: Two brothers... Yes! Whoo-hoo! This is fun! Way underwater... Waah! Shark! Whoa! Way, way, way over their heads! It's a rip current! We're getting sucked into it!

Another way to say two of something is to say, "a pair." For example, the man with the yellow hat has two eyes, or a pair of eyes. He also has a pair of hands. Can you find something else that's in a pair? Shoes! Right! He's wearing a pair of shoes. You can play more games like this at pbskids.Org.

chase! <Dr. Marbles> THERE IT IS! THERE IT IS! That's strange, according to my data there should be an entrance around here somewhere. But I can't seem to - whooooooa! 

[00:02:00]


Ahhhhhh! Data lock confirmed! The encryptor chip is precisely where archimedes said it would be. Soon, motherboard, I will be able to eliminate your virus! Ugh! Can't quite reach. Ah! Oh no! Ahhhh!!! <Matt> CHICK-EE! Whoa! Oh, great. <Motherboard> MATT. <Matt> MOTHERBOARD. <Motherboard> DR. MARBLES HAS FOUND THE ENCRYPTOR Chip. <Matt> WELL, THAT'S GREAT NEWS! <Motherboard> (STATIC) BUT...MARBLES HAS Been captured. ...The pyramid. The tomb of rom ...Mummy chamber... <Motherboard> ...NO TIME TO WASTE! <Matt> AHHHHHHH! <Matt> HEY GUYS! <Inez> HEY MATT. LOOKS LIKE WE GOT TROUBLE. <Matt> BIG TIME. <Inez> LET'S DO IT! <Inez> WELL, HERE WE ARE, GUYS, ANOTHER DAY At the beach. <Jackie> BUT I GET THE FEELING WE WON'T BE Swimming and soaking up the rays. <Matt> NOT A CHANCE, WE GOTTA FIND THE DOC. Come on. <Inez> MOTHERBOARD SAID SOMETHING ABOUT A Pyramid and a tomb. It's gotta be around here somewhere. <Jackie> SOMEWHERE? SOMEWHERE? WE'VE BEEN Walking for, like, for like...Hours! <Matt> JACKS, WE'VE BEEN WALKING FOR TWO Minutes. <Jackie> WHATEVER! THE POINT IS, THERE'S Nothing but sand. Sand...And that! 

[00:04:03]


<Matt> WHOA! <Jackie> MUST BE THE PYRAMID MOTHERBOARD Was talking about. <Matt> YEAH, BUT WHAT'S THAT? <Inez> DIGIT! <Digit> SO, YOU FIND THE DOC AND THE ENCRYPTOR Chip, yet? <Jackie> WE JUST GOT HERE. WE HAVEN'T BEEN Inside. <Digit> I TELL YOU WHAT, YOU GO IN - I'LL Stand guard out here. <Matt> COME ON, DIDGE, You're not afraid of a little old pyramid, are you? <Digit> I'M NOT AFRAID OF THE PYRAMID, OKAY? It's what's inside that I'm not too excited about. <Jackie> WELL YOU WON'T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT It if we can't figure out how to get in. <Matt> IN THE MOVIES, YOU JUST PRESS A BRICK And a secret door opens. <Digit> THIS HAS AS MUCH CHANCE OF WORKING As I have of growing feathers! Yikes! Ehhhh. <Matt> WOW! AWESOME. <Inez> OVER HERE! <Jackie> DID YOU FIND A CLUE? <Inez> MAYBE HIEROGLYPHS! Word pictures used by the ancient egyptians. <Matt> HMM...A HIPPO...SOME KIND OF BUG...A Cat... And up here...What is that?? <Inez> IT LOOKS LIKE A MUMMY. <Digit> I WAS AFRAID YOU'D SAY THAT. <Jackie> LOOK OVER THERE, ABOVE THAT DOOR. <Matt> ANOTHER HIPPO. <Inez> JUST LIKE THIS ONE! <Matt> YOU KNOW WHAT I THINK. I think this is a map that shows the different rooms in the pyramid! <Inez> I THINK THEY'RE CALLED CHAMBERS. <Matt> ROOMS, CHAMBERS - WHATEVER. My guess is, we're right about here! And marbles and the encryptor chip should be right here! <Digit> IN THE MUMMY ROOM? <Jackie> THAT'S WHAT MOTHERBOARD SAID. <Matt> LET'S GO. <Inez> WAIT. LET'S SCAN THE MAP INTO THE Skwak pad in case we get lost. <Inez> MAP SCANNED! 

[00:06:04]


<Matt> COOL! LET'S GET STARTED. <Voice> WHO DARES ENTER THE TOMB OF ROM? Ahhhhhh!!!! <Inez> WHO'S THAT? <Voice> SILENCE! LEAVE NOW OR SUFFER THE Consequences! <Inez> WHAT'S GOING ON?! <Binky> REALLY, I DO LOVE THE DRAMA OF IT All. <Binky> DON'T YOU, MUMMSIE? <Mummy> BE SCARIER. BINKY! One intruder is enough for the day. <Binky> I'LL START LOWERING THE SLAB. (LAUGHS) That should cause a fright. <Jackie> UH! AM I HAVING A MOMENT, OR IS That thing getting lower? <Matt> BUT WE'VE GOTTA GO THROUGH THERE TO Find dr. Marbles. <Binky> GO NO FURTHER! <Inez> THIS IS NOT GOOD. THIS IS NOT GOOD At all! <Binky> SHOULD YOU CHOOSE TO PROCEED INSIDE, And the door reaches all the way to the floor... You will be sealed forever in the tomb of rom! <Binky> BETTER? <Mummy> MUCH! <Dr. Marbles> MMMMPH-MMMMMPH-MMMPH-MMMPH! <Mummy> KNOW YOU LISTEN TO ME, BUBBLEHEAD! This is my pyramid. And they're here because you're here! So don't blame me. Mmmmmmmmph-mmmph... <Mummy> HOLD ON. Ow! The name hacker mean anything to you? <Mummy> HACKER? THAT DOUBLE-DEALING CYBER-SISSY?! Spare the children, and I'll give you something hacker desperately wants. <Binky> AND...AH... THAT IS...? Me! <Inez> IT'S LIKE EVERY MINUTE, THAT THING Gets lower! <Matt> COME ON, WE'RE WASTING TIME. We've gotta find marbles fast! <Jackie> MATT, WAIT! YOU HEARD WHAT THAT Voice said. If we go any further, we could be trapped! <Digit> GOOD POINT. TIME TO GO HOME. <Inez> HOLD IT. I THINK TIME IS THE KEY. If only we knew how much time we had before the door shuts. <Matt> HEY, CHECK IT OUT. THE WATER SEEMS To be running out at a steady pace. And it looks like the door is dropping at the same rate. 

[00:08:07]


<Jackie> I BET IF WE COULD FIGURE OUT HOW Long it takes for the water to drop one stripe, we could figure out how much time we have left. Gimme your watch, matt, I'll time it. <Matt> IT'S BUSTED. <Jackie> NO PROBLEM. YOU'RE IN THE PRESENCE Of the queen of steady counting. Just tell me when the water gets to the next stripe and I'll start. <Inez> HOLD IT...HOLD IT...COUNT! <Jackie> ONE ALLIGATOR, TWO ALLIGATOR, THREE Alligator... - Four alligator, five alligator, six alligator... <Hacker> DID YOU SAY DR. MARBLES??! <Hacker> I WANT HIM! <Binky> THAT'S THE PROBLEM WITH YOU, HACKER. It's always me, me, me. You never think of anyone but yourself. <Hacker> FINE! LET'S TALK ABOUT MARBLES, Then. Give him to me! <Binky> I'LL GET BACK TO YOU. <Mummy> DID YOU MAKE THE DEAL? <Binky> NOT, YET. (EXHALE) BUT I WILL. <Jackie> ...SIXTY-ONE ALLIGATOR, SIXTY-TWO Alligator, sixty-three alligator... Done! Ok, it takes about a second to say each alligator. So, sixty three alligator is about... <Jackie> - A MINUTE. <Digit> EXCEPT YOU LOST COUNT A COUPLE OF Times when you sneezed. <Inez> CLOSE ENOUGH! IF IT FALLS ONE STRIPE Every minute - how much time do we have? <Matt> ...FOURTEEN, FIFTEEN STRIPES LEFT. At a minute a stripe - we have 15 minutes to find dr. Marbles and geback here before... <Jackie> BEFORE WE GET STUCK IN HERE FOREVER! That's a little risky, don't you think? <Matt> WE HAVE NO CHOICE, JAX. <Inez> WELL, WAIT A SECOND MATT, <Matt> NOT AGAIN! <Inez> IF WE DON'T KEEP TRACK OF TIME WHILE We're in there, how will we know when our fifteen minutes is up? <Matt> WE'LL...LET JAX COUNT OUT IN GATOR Time. <Jackie> NO WAY! WHAT IF I LOSE TRACK? WHAT If I sneeze again? And - how will we know how much time is left? 

[00:10:07]


<Inez> THERE MUST BE A WAY TO MEASURE THE Passage of time while the door is dropping. <Jackie> WHAT WE REALLY NEED IS A CLOCK. <Digit> OOPS. SORRY ABOUT THE HOUR GLASS. Now it's a (chuckle) half-hour glass. Ha! <Matt> WAIT A MINUTE! An hourglass measures time by dripping sand at a steady rate all we need is the top part to do that! And something to drip through! <Jackie> HOW ABOUT THESE? <Matt> LET'S TRY IT. Pour some in. <Matt> LISTEN! <Inez> THE RUBIES ARE DRIPPING AT THE SAME Rate as the water! <Jackie> AND THE SAME AS MY ALLIGATOR COUNT! <Matt> SO WE CAN USE THEM TO KEEP TRACK OF Time! <Inez> BUT THAT MEANS WE HAVE TO COUNT EVERY Single ruby as it falls out! No way we can to do that! <Digit> HEY, LOOK WHAT ELSE I FOUND! <Digit> AN ANCIENT ME! SEE THE BOID! SEE The boid drink! <Matt> THAT'S JUST WHAT WE NEED TO MEASURE Time! <Digit> UHH! TELL ME I DIDN'T SEE THAT! <Matt> LET'EM DROP, JAX. <Jackie> IT WORKS! WE DON'T HAVE TO COUNT The rubies one-by-one, we can catch them in the bird cup. Then when it's full... <Matt> IT EMPTIES ITSELF! <Jackie> ALRIGHT! WE CAN KEEP TIME BY COUNTING Cups instead of rubies! <Inez> YOU FORGOT SOMETHING, GUYS. <Matt> NOW WHAT? <Inez> WE NEED TO KNOW HOW MANY CUPS IT TAKES For the door to drop one stripe. <Matt> IT'S ALMOST AT THE NEXT STRIPE! FILL It up! <Inez> GET READY. Start the clock. <Matt> CLOCK STARTED. <Jackie> MEASURING TIME! 

[00:12:10]


<Matt> TIME MEASURED! <Inez> THIS IS PERFECT! The bird cup fills up in the same amount of time the door drops one stripe! <Matt> TWELVE STRIPES - THAT MEANS WE'VE Got twelve cups of time to get to the mummy chamber and back. Let's motor! <Inez> LET'S GO! Oh dear, they are stubborn, aren't they? <Mummy> RELEASE THE SCARAB BEETLES! <Inez> ACCORDING TO THE MAP, The beetle chamber should be right around this corner. <Matt> 11 CUPS OF TIME LEFT! LET'S GO! <Jackie> EWWWWWWWWWW!!! YUCK! <Inez> YUP! THIS IS DEFINITELY THE (GULP) Beetle room! <Matt> C'MON! WE'RE WASTING TIME. <Inez> <Jackie>, COME ON! <Matt> YOU CAN MAKE IT! <Jackie> THERE IS ABSOLUTELY NO WAY I'M GETTING Near those bugs! Nope, not gonna do it. You can just count me right out. See ya. Bye-bye! <Matt> THIS ISN'T ABOUT YOU, JAX - OR US! It's about motherboard! <Inez> SHE NEEDS YOU! <Jackie> YOU KNOW WHAT? THAT IS SO TOTALLY Unfair! Oh, man! Okay, here goes nothing! Ahh-ahhhh-ahhh...!!! Way to go, jax! Good job! Good job! <Matt> ANOTHER BIRD CUP DOWN. ONLY ABOUT 10 minutes left. <Inez> HURRY! <Wicked> NEXT YOU TAKE THE BAT WING, And gently pin the lizard skull right there, right in the middle. 

[00:14:11]


These are a beautiful touch to any evil gathering. Really beautiful. (Cheers and whistles) <Binky> HOO. THAT WICKED SURE DOES HAVE Style. <Mummy> I WANT HER TO REDECORATE THE TOMB. <Binky> HELLLOOOO? TOMB OF ROM, HOW MAY I Help you? <Hacker> I'LL SAY IT AGAIN, STINKY, GIVE Me dr. Marbles! <Binky> EH, DR. MARBLES IS ALL TIED UP RIGHT Now. <Hacker> DON'T MESS WITH ME, YOU FUR-BRAINED Feline! Ha him over! <Binky> HMMM...WHAT DOES MUMMY GET IN RETURN? <Hacker> NOTHING! YOU GET NOTHING! <Binky> IS THAT YOUR FINAL ANSWER? <Hacker> (ROARING)NOTHING! Oh, some people are so selfish! <Mummy> BINKS! THEY GOT PAST THE BUGS! <Binky> WHAT?!? Hmmmm...Time for my ghosts. <Matt> ALRIGHT! WE MADE IT TO THE CAT CHAMBER! <Jackie> GOOD. CATS I LIKE. <Inez> NEXT STOP, THE MUMMY ROOM. <Matt> NINE CUPS OF TIME TO GO - OR IS IT Eight? I forget. <Jackie> IT'S NINE. <Digit> EXCUSE ME, WE'RE TALKIN' LIFE AND, Ah.. You-know-what, here. This is no time to be guessing. <Inez> DIGIT'S RIGHT! THERE'S GOTTA BE A Way to keep track of how much time has passed! <Jackie> MAYBE WE CAN USE THIS! LOOK. IT'S Got ten stripes on it - we can mark off one stripe for every bird cup. And I can use my bracelet as a marker! <Inez> CLASSIC! JUST START IT AT THE NINTH Stripe and move down one stripe every bird cup. That way, we'll see for sure how much time we have left. <Jackie> THE NINTH STRIPE IT IS! <Matt> IT WORKS FOR ME! NOW LET'S GO! <Jackie> OH, NO! <Matt> HEY! WHAT WAS THAT?! <Digit> I - I DON'T KNOW. Let's put some light on the situation. <Inez> I UH...I THINK WE HAVE COMPANY. 

[00:16:15]


<Binky> GO GET 'EM, GIRLS. <Jackie> WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO? <Matt> RUN! Go away! Scat! Ow! Beat it! Get outta here! <Matt> OH NO! I DROPPED THE RUBIES. <Jackie> OH, MAN! BUGS, GHOSTS CATS, LOST Rubies. Can things get any worse? Of course. <Digit> WHAT A WAY FOR A BIRD TO GO. BURIED In kitty litter. <Matt> IF ONLY WE HAD A MOUSE. <Digit> DID YOU SAY MOUSE? NO PROBLEM, GOT Ya covered, mattster. Alright! Way to go! Way to go, didge! <Inez> OH, AT LAST, THE MUMMY CHAMBER! <Matt> SO WHERE'S DR. MARBLES? HE'S SUPPOSED To be here. <Digit> BEFORE WE LOOK FOR THE DOC, WE BETTER Look for more rubies. <Jackie> WHEN WE RUN OUT OF RUBIES, We won't be able to keep track of time! We'll be trapped in here forever! <Inez> WE STILL HAVE SEVEN STRIPES LEFT. <Matt> SEVEN STRIPES - SEVEN MINUTES. THAT'S Not much time! <Mummy> LOOKS LIKE I'LL HAVE TO TAKE CARE Of things myself! As usual. <Binky> MEOW. HELLLOOOO? TOMB OF ROM. <Hacker> FOR THE LAST TIME, GIVE ME DR. MARBLES! <Binky> I HAVE A PROPOSAL. AHEM. YOU KNOW The wicked witch? <Hacker> OF COURSE I KNOW HER! <Binky> IT'S YOUR LUCKY DAY, THEN. Bring me wicked, and dr. Marbles is all yours. <Hacker> WHAT??! <Binky> YOU HEARD ME. WICKED FOR MARBLES. Ta-ta.

I can hardly wait. This place has such potential. <Hacker> YOU TWO! <Delete> YEAH, BOSS? <Hacker> GO TO THE PYRAMID AND GET DR. MARBLES Now! Right away, boss! Yeah. <Digit> GOT 'EM! <Matt> POUR THEM BACK SO WE DON'T LOSE ANY Time! <Jackie> SIX MINUTES TO LEFT! <Matt> OKAY, WHAT HAVE WE GOT? It took us five bird cups of time to get here - so we need five bird cups to get back. <Digit> WE ONLY GOT ONE BIRD CUP TO SPARE. We got one minute to find the doc, or... <Inez> UH-OH.

>> I'm here with facial plastic surgeon dr. David kent. He's a member of the prestigious american academy of facial, plastic and reconstructive surgery and the founder of lifestyle lift. Dr. Kent, more than 150,000 people have already had a lifestyle lift. Why is it so popular? 
>> There's a lot of reasons why lifestyle lift is so popular. One of the number one reasons is is that people these days are much healthier, they feel young, you know, they're much more active than previous generations. And they kinda want their outsides to match their insides. They don't like looking older when they feel so young. Other reasons that lifestyle lift is so popular is because our doctors are experts at doing this. They focus exclusively on the face and they do more of these types of procedures than pretty much any doctor in the country. So they become very, very good and they know how to treat every individual depending on their various characteristics to get the best possible results. 
>> What are some of the things that people are afraid of? 
>> I think the biggest risk with having a procedure to make yourself look younger is with the anesthesia and at lifestyle lift we've really completely removed the serious risks of i.V. And general anesthesia and it's much safer that way. 
>> I'm in show business, so i have seen a lot of people who have had a lot of different kinds of procedures and I am kind of astounded how natural the people look who've had a lifestyle lift. 
>> We strive for that natural appearance, that natural result. Lifestyle lift doesn't change you. It simply makes you look the same way you did years ago. 

[00:08:59]


>> What I'm hoping for is for the skin to be just tightened up in this area, you know, just to look firmer and just a better profile in general. Because I just don't like when i turn to the side especially. I just feel like it's just not as distinct as it used to be. When I'd see a picture of myself or I'd walk by a mirror, I would actually stop, especially if the mirror was on the side and just take a double glance and just couldn't believe the change in just a few years, you know, and I was unaware how it just kind of crept up on me. When I saw the before pictures, I had no idea that it was as bad as I thought. You know, you walk around every day and I was aware that i didn't like my profile and i hadn't liked it for a long time. But I can't believe that I had that kind of change. Again, literally it was just overnight. As soon as it was over, within 24 hours, my husband looked for the first time and said you could immediately see a difference and change. I mean, drastically. 
>> Joining us now is dr. Judi bloom, a licensed marriage and family therapist in california who has a degree in clinical psychology and she's also a well-known radio personality. Dr. Bloom, what would you say are the psychological benefits of looking younger? 
>> You know, I think there are great psychological benefits in looking younger. For a lot of people, it helps them feel like their insides and their outsides match again, because they actually felt younger inside than the world was treating them. And they find that the world starts to respond differently when they look different and that enhances people's sense of self, their self-esteem, their self-confidence. 
>> And dr. Kent, who would you say are your typical patients? 
>> Well, my typical patient is somebody who really wants to do something for themselves... Has probably raised children, taking care of spouses, worked their whole life and really never did anything for themselves. And they kind of look in the mirrwr and they say, "i'm gonna do something for myself this time." 
>> I did this lifestyle lift for myself. I've spent the last nine years taking care of my mom and my mother passed away about a year ago and I decided it's time for me to start doing good things for myself. And I saw that I was starting to look a little droopy around the edges with my chin and I heard about lifestyle lift and I got excited and went in and spoke to them and made the decision that this is something that I would like to do for myself. Now that my neck is gone and I've had the procedure done, my friends tell me that I look younger to them and some of my friends are 15 years younger than me and it makes me feel good about myself. Now I don't have to hide my profile or feel bad about my profile anymore. 

[00:11:41]


>> Now let's meet eloise. Here's a video of her before her festyle lift. 
>> When I look in the mirror, I see these fat pouches that hang, lots of wrinkles around my mouth, and then I also see a sagging neck. So, um, it looks old and it looks tired and, um, very unattractive, I think. 
>> And now here's eloise today. Wow! You look amazing. 
>> Thank you so much. 
>> How do you think your lifestyle lift turned out? 
>> Oh, I loved it at the very beginning and I'm just now amazed because it's actually smoother, tighter, the jowls, my chin. It's great and perfect and it's three years later. 
>> Three years later. 
>> So I couldn't be happier. 
>> [Laughs] would you say that getting a lifestyle lift boosted your confidence? 
>> Oh, I've always been actually a pretty confident person. The thing that I really noticed since I've had it done, is that everyone responds to me with more confidence in me. >> Wow. 
>> They don't treat me as if I'm an older person that is getting out of touch with current things and with life as it is. So that's been a benefit that i never would have expected. 
>> Dr. Kent, eloise looks amazing. Is this kind of physical transformation what all of your patients can expect? 
>> Well, everybody's different, but we certainly can make everybody look better and she's a great example of what we can do with the lifestyle lift. 
>> She sure is. Procedures like this have been thought of as something that only the very wealthy can afford. Is this now something that anybody could afford? 
>> Well, I would say in the past, before lifestyle lift, procedures like this and the ability to look younger were really reserved for wealthy people, movie stars. We have made it affordable now for almost everybody to look younger. 

[00:13:52]


>> Eloise, would you say that this was worth the investment you made in yourself? 
>> Absolutely. My husband would concur as well and one of the things he told me he feels very proud of is that I've continued to take care of myself. Um, it takes a lot of the pressure off of him. He thinks I'm gonna live longer and healthier and it's a good thing to have your husband admire you. 
>> Ooh, it certainly is. Do you mind telling us your age when you had the lifestyle lift and your age now? 
>> Absolutely not. I'm really very proud to say that I had this done when I was 69 years old and that was three years ago and now I'm 72. 
>> [Laughs] I think that's amazing! 
>> Thank you. Thank you and it feels great. It feels great to be 72.

>> I'd like to now introduce someone who knows a lot about looking good. Michelle bouse is a licensed esthetician and celebrity make-up artist whose clients include some of hollywood's biggest stars. Now, michelle, you work with a lot of people who really want to look younger. Tell us about the many skin treatments and things that you would use to offer a quick but minor fix. 
>> Well, a lot of what I do with celebrities and the average person arecial events and red carpet events. So what they're looking for is a quick fix for maybe one day. They want to look great, they want to look firm, they want to look tight and they want their make-up to be beautiful and flawless. So a lot of what I'm doing lasts about a day, maybe a day and a half if it's a topical cream, but once they wipe their face off, the make-up is gone, my magic is gone and then once they wait a few days, the topical creams have worn down and their skin goes back to thit was before I did the event. 
>> What do you think about the lifestyle lift and the natural results people have? 
>> There has been a need for this treatment for a long time. This is a very difficult area to treat for me as an esthetician and as a make-up artist. There's only so much I can do in the nec area. 
>> So, for some of these clients who have asked you now, with what you've seen, what would you say to them? 
>> I think a lot of people are intimidated to try something and have a procedure done because they're afraid it's not going to look natural, that it's going to be overdone. You see everybody on tv... 
>> What have they done? 
>> They looked so good before. What happened? And it wasn't necessarily something that enhanced the way they looked, and I think everybody still wants to look like themselves, they just want to look like they di when they were younger. But they still want to look like themselves-- they don't want to look totally different. 
>> So now let me introduce you to maggie. Let's roll maggie's before video. This is how she looked before lifestyle lift. 
>> It's not that I don't like my appearance, I just feel that there's always room for improvement. I actually saw the lifestyle lift commercial and I was saying, "gee, those women look just like me," the before shots. And I said, "i want to look like those after shots." 

[00:17:58]


>> Now here she is after. Let's welcome maggie. What an astonishing difference. 
>> Thanks, debby. 
>> Now tell me, why did you get the lifestyle lift? 
>> Well, I'm a pretty happy person and whenever I would look in the mirror, I always saw these frown lines. I never looked like I was smiling and that's just not who maggie is. 
>> Well, how has your life changed? 
>> Well, I walk a little taller. I've taken better care of myself-- I wear sunscreen now. [Debby chuckles] and, um, I put accessories on that I didn't-- wouldn't have normally done. I was basically a mascara/lipstick person. 
>> Well, michelle, are you impressed with maggie's results? Just tell us what you see. 
>> Definitely, maggie. You've had some great before and after results. You should be so happy. You look like you really got a great lift on your neck area as well as your jowls have disappeared and your deep frown lines around your mouth. I see a little bit of a lift even on the lower cheek/jaw line. It looks beautiful. 
>> Thank you so much. 
>> Great results and so natural. 
>> Would you say you're happier today after having had the lifestyle lift? 
>> I do like the results. I'm very pleased.

>> Thank you! I feel fantastic. Thank you very much. 
>> Tell me, colleen, why did you decide to go ahead and do a lifestyle lift? 
>> My face was really showing signs of aging. At a younger age, I had jowls. I had too much skin. I felt the chicken neck coming up. 
>> What about positive changes in your life since you had the lifestyle lift? 
>> I think the most is that i was pretty much giving up on trying to look good. I wouldn't do my hair. I wouldn't dress up. I'd, you know, put on the jogging pants or the overalls and not put on make-up, because it never looked good enough. It's like I didn't feel like i looked pretty anymore, so now i have inspiration to want to do that. 
>> So tell me, what kind of responses have you been getting from maybe friends or family? 
>> Oh, they're all amazed. I've had so many friends go out and get consultations. Quite a few haotten it done for themselves and my boyfriend, he actually went and got his done, ... >> Really? 
>> Yeah, he's 10 years older than me and he's like, he's in the business, the music business, and so he sings on stage and so it was real important for him. 
>> What would you say to someone who's maybe considering having a procedure like this done? 
>> I say run, do not walk, and go get it done. [Both laugh] really, it will make all the difference because it's natural, you don't feel fake, you don't feel like, "oh my god, I'm one of those people that, you know, who are you?" It's me and they don't know really what I did. They just know I look great.

>>> it's going to be a test of wills. How bad do you want it? How bad do you want it? 
>> The time to fight is now. The desire to be great runs deep in every player and the will to succeed is what can turn an underdog into a world champion. Two teams ha already advanced with the ravens upsetting the broncos. Today the fight to stay alive continues on fox. Atlanta defends its home turf looking for reverse its previous playoff miss fortune, led by a quarterback looking to prove himself and a future hall of famer desperate to win. The dirty birds believe this is their time. But the seahawks have played the underdog all season. Russell wilson and the gritty defense come into the dome defiant. Never giving in, they display a confidence and swagger of a veteran squad who looks to extinguish the falcons super bowl hopes. So stay tuned, because this is a fight you don't want to miss. It's next and it's here and nobody does it like fox. 

[00:02:03]


>>> Despite a hall of fame career that spanned 16 careers, tony gonzalez has never won a playoff game, let alone a super bowl. Win or lose, this will likely be tony's sfiechbl in the nfl and he hopes today isn't his final game. On the other end of the career spectrum is seattle's russell wilson. For all the talk about rg3 and andrew luck, wilson is the last MAN STANDING IN THE ROOKIE QBs The seahawks take on the top seed atlanta falcons. The winner moves on to play the 49ers IN THE NFC TITLE GAME. As always, all the drama will unfold right here on fox starting with the one and only ford fox pregame show brought to you by the 2013 fusion, go further. Come on in and stay a while, folks, I'm curt menefee. Thanks for watching and thanks to mark wahlberg for kicking things off. His new movie "broken city" opens in theaters starting this friday. Broken city can also describe what might appear in atlanta if the falcons lose today. The guys who will talk all day about that, terry, howie, michael and jimmy joining us. We can only hope today is as good as yesterday. 
>> Terry: That job colin kaepernick did last night is for the ages. 
>> Howie: Today is a classic contrasting styles. Matt ryan, pocket quarterback, versus russell wilson, that new breed of quarterback. 
>> Curt: That will wrap up this divisional weekend. Everything got started yesterday. In the afc the ravens pulled off a thrilling comeback victory in double overtime to stun the broncos 38-35. Baltimore makes back-to-back championship game appearances for the first time in franchise history. AND THEN LAST NIGHT, 49ers Quarterback colin kaepernick capped off a great day of football with a record-breaking performance that sent green bay packing. San francisco gets back to the nfc title game for the second straight year as well. Jimmy, we talked about it. Yesterday was super duper wonderful, special fantastic. Super calilistic. 

[00:04:15]


>> Jimmy: You feel bad for the denver broncos but you feel good for ray lewis altimore. Then in the san francisco game, just the dominance of an up and coming superstar, colin kaepernick. What baffles me is all these defenses having problems with this read option. We could see the exact same thing today with russell wilson going against that atlanta defense. 
>> Curt: We'll talk more about russell wilson and the falcon defense but next sunday on fox it is the nfc championship game as the niners will face the winner of seattle and atlanta. Of course the seahawks are on a roll right now, having won six straight games. As for the falcons, they're 0-3 in the playoffs during the matt ryan/mike smith era. So the pressure clearly on atlanta today which is where we head right now. For more on this matchup and the guys calling this playoff contest, thom brennaman and brian billick. Hey, fellas, how fired up is atlanta right now, the city. 
>> Thom: Well, they're very fired up to have this divisional playoff game. Having said that, it is an apprehensive fan base based on what's happened their last four trips to the playoffs, three under mike shot and matt ryan. Brian, you compare and contrast these teams. Atlanta 13 wins, the number one seed. But their starters, the oldest group in the nfl. Meanwhile, for seattle, young, hungry, the second youngest team in the nfl. 
>> Brian: That only begins to contrast the stark difference in these two teams, both in personnel and in style. Let's start with seattle. Big, physical, downhill, punishing running attack and defensively the biggest secondary in the league. They just want to maul you all over the field. For the atlanta falcons it's all about the passing game. Matt ryan and maybe one of the best and deepest receiving corps in the nfl. But for them defensively, they're undersized, so by scheme they have to be very multiple, maybe one of the best swarm tackling teams I've seen all year long. Head coach mike smith told us if we're going to beat seattle, we're going to have to find a way to get a more and bigger pads on marshawn lynch and russell wilson than anybody before. 

[00:06:16]


>> Thom: Well, the winner advances on right here on fox next weekend to the nfc championship game, where the 49ers AWAIT THE WINNER OF THIS One. Right now, curt, back to you and the rest of the gang in l.A. 
>> Curt: All right, thanks a lot, guys. Let's face it, the falcons dominated the nfc. The division title was never really in doubt. But today, t.B., They have a tough task facing a hot team and a lot of pressure on themselves right now. 
>> Terry: Well, they're 0-3 in the playoffs under mike smith and matt ryan, their quarterback. But I want to just take our fans quickly and howie said this last night. The evolution of quarterbacking in the nfl, as we all have known it, jimmy, where we want a pocket passer. Last night we say goodbye to aaron rodgers,ific quarterback, hall of famer. We say goodbye to peyton manning. Hello colin kaepernick who put on a phenomenal show. The spread or the read offense. Cam newton, we've seen him do, rg3 do it, kaepernick do it and today we see another, a pocket quarterback in matt ryan versus a read option, spread option quarterback, a moving quarterback, a guy that supposedly is undersized and that's russell wilson. Truly remarkable what they have accomplished 
>> Michael: The read option was something you saw in college a lot. Great in college but once you get to the pros it won't translate. Everybody got really excited about the wildcat. The read option has the type of athletes you need to run it between cam newton, russ sell WILSON AND RG3s. But if seattle can focus and win this game,hey'll go to san francisco and play a team they handled well in seattle. If you think this team has any confidence now, they win this game today, if I was san francisco, no matter how great they loed yesterday, I would worry about playing the seattle seahawks. 
>> Howie: A lot has been made of their three playoff losses. All three teams they lost to advanced to the super bowl, two won the super bowl. You can make the case this offense barely resembles the offense matt ryan first took to the playoffs. For a team that's won as many games as they have over the last three, four years, no offense has evolved more. After the green bay loss they made a conscious decision. We're going to put the keys to the car in matt ryan's hand. We're going to get more explosive. Julio jones, 3 wide receiver sets. That's who they are. They beat you with their skill players and with matt ryan. 

[00:08:33]


>> Jimmy: Howie, you look at this atlanta team, 13-3. So are they confidence? Are they three playoff losses or uptight? I think it's a lot like taking a test. If you're thoroughly prepared, you look forward to taking that test. 
>> Terry: I know I did, jimmy. 
>> Jimmy: But if seattle throws a few wrinkles in there and they're not prepared for it, uh-oh, they start getting a little uptight and that could happen today. 
>> Ct: Lots more to break down involving this game. We are just getting revved up, in fact. As we check out what else we have on tap, there's no question the hottest team in the league right now is the seattle seahawks. Russell wilson, pete carroll and the hawks tell our chris myers how they plan to keep the remarkable run going in atlanta. 
>>> Meanwhile the seahawks opponent is trying to ending its playoff woes. Matt ryan and the falcons revial what will make this year different. Also we'll head out for foxborough where john lynch has a look at the afc championship game. That plus jay glazer bringing the inside info and rock riggle with the comedy because there's that and much more on the ford fox nfl pregame show brought to you by the 2013 fusion.

[00:12:52]


>> Jay: You just said it, heart-breaking. Fox is upset as is the rest of the team. He said, listen, there's going to be a lot of people looking to see how you handle this. Guys, we've got to rise above together, you've got to stick together and handle it the right way. 
>> Curt: A lot of teams still looking for head coaches. Take us through it. 
>> Jay: Seattle's defensive coordinator, gus bradley, had a great interview with the philadelphia eagles. If they lose later today, look for philadelphia to bring gus bradley back in. He's a hot name down there. Also his counterpart for the atlanta falcons, mike nolan, he interviewed for philadelphia, but a lot of people don't know before cleveland hired rob chudzinski, they really wanted to bring mike nolan in there. He said I'm very happy where i am. It's such a great job, I love being here in atlanta. Now let's go around the rest of the coaching carousel starting with yesterday's game. mike McCoy, offensive coordinator for john fox's denver broncos offense, the arizona cardinals want to bring him in, san diego chargers are hot for him also and san diego today is bringing in jay gruden, offensive coordinator for the cincinnati bengals. Not jon gruden, but jay gruden. They also want to talk to bruce arians as well and also the jacksonville jaguars will look at rick dennison, the fensive coordinator for the houston texans. One more note here, the new york jets. We've got to talk about the jets a little bit. The new york jets are looking for a general manager. They can't give the position away. They're now calling back candidates who have already turned them down saying please reconsider. They're having a hard time finding that gm. 
>> You don't usually hear that about one of 32 jobs in the national football league. 
>> Jay: You could take it. 
>> Curt: I think I'll pass. I love being here with you, that's why. We'll catch up with you later for late-breaking injury news as well. 
>>> Well, a lot has been made of russell wilson being an undersized quarterback. He's generously listed as 5'11". State farm brings us our state of the game. 
>> Terry: There is a reason why nfl teams like their quarterbacks tall. Very simply, the taller you are, obviously it's easier to see down the field and see your receivers and see over your offensive line. Well, russell wilson isn't that tall so they compensate for -- look at this. Here's russell wilson at 5'10", here I ams the receiver. Can you see me? Here I am right here. Now, I'm going to grow right before your eyes. Up comes the camera and I'm 6'4", 6'5". Now look. Now he can see this receiver. How they compensate for the lack of height in seattle is what jimmy calls the spread offense. They also do the bootlegs and get him out of the pocket where he can get out and have space. Look, he is excellent in throwing downfield. One of the reasons is if you're short, the further you get from the line of scrimmage, the shorter the defensive linemen and your offensive linemen get, and the opening is to the defense and you can see. The further back you get when you're short, the easier to throw downfield deep, which he is excellent at. So today he'll be outside both right and left, bootlegs and he will drop deep to throw deep passes. 

[00:16:01]


>> Curt: Nice job, now we understand it. Befo go to break, a reminder that fox sports has been proud to support the children's organ transplant organization all season long. It's been a great year and you can make miracles for kids who need life-saving transplants. Text cota to 20222 today to make a $10 donation and help save kids' lives. 
>>> Up next, john lynch invites us to his tailgate party live in foxborough as he previews today's afc playoff game between the houston texans and new england patriots. 
>>> Plus we'll hear from seattle's russell wilson, pete carroll and a controversial charact who likes to get under his opponents' skin, defensive back richard sherman. 
>>> Speaking of getting under your skin, the falcons might be a bit edgy as they try to overcome their playoff failures. We'll find out how matt ryan is dealing with the pressure. The countdown to kickoff officially underway as the georgia dome is just about ready to explode. And just like falcons fans are predicting victory, you can pick your team's plays an scores by downloading the bud light sports fan app. We'll be right back. Ready for a little fun?

[00:20:55]


>> Curt: From the album 37 is all over the airways but front manat mon han is all over the nfl. He stopped by to sing about nfl football ?????? jets fans fell into a rut when sanchez ran into a butt and fumbled. There's always next year ?????? 
>> didn't I say that last year? ?????? The seahawks battle the falcons, ?????? 
>> Curt: The only thing missing was that scroll across the top of the screen. That was the lead singer of the band train. You know what, the texans right now hoping they're back on track after last week's wild card win over the bengals. Of course houston's main locomotive, arian foster, is coming off a 140-yard performance. However, today he and the texans take on that third rail of the nfl playoffs, tom brady and the patriots. For more on this matchup, we chug on over to john lynch who's tailgating in foxborough. John, before we get to the game, what you got cooking there? 
>> Well, curt, we've got some cowboy ribeye, some spicy wings and of course in new england you've got to have your seafood. We all know in new england, playoff football, that's a staple on the menu. Now, for the texans, playoff football, they got a taste last year and they're back for more. After what happened here in foxborough week 14, not many are giving them a chance. 
>> Brady fires, open, touchdown rob gronkowski. 
>> J.J. Watt. 
>> Into the end zone, wes welker. 10, 5, touchdown! 
>> Kevin lloyd. 
>> He's in, touchdown, arian foster. 
>> Let's start with arian foster. Back in 2004, you guys both entered as freshmen at the university of tennessee. 

[00:22:57]


>> I was always at the building late and I happened to see a running back at the building late and I decided I want to be a good linebacker and you want to be a good running back, let's work together. 
>> I promise you he'll get his touches. 
>> You're going to put this team on your back. I told him let's go. 
>> Growing up as a kid you're making that spectacular catch on the sidelines with your buddies, those are the moments you dream about. Give me the ball. 
>> Tom brady, one of the greats of all time. We know the talent but what else is it that allows him to shine on the biggest stage. 
>> I think he's the ultimate competitor. 
>> Tom is different. I've never seen tom not talking about football. 
>> You can play chess against the guy and if he loses he throws the board. You think he's joking but he's not. 
>> He sees a lot of things. He'll change the signals. 
>> Last time we played them they had a jail break screen signal. He made that signal, ran the fake jail screen and threw it deep. He plays quarterback. 
>> My, oh my. 
>> This is a reception changer right here. 
>> You guys whooped them. What's that mean for this sunday? 
>> It means nothing. 
>> The only thing we can take away from it is they clearly didn't play their best game and we didn't play our best game either. 
>> Playing for a coach like bill, you can probably have your game and you wouldn't hear it from him. 
>> That game should have been a lot closer. 
>> I imagine bill reminded you of that. 
>> That football team, that franchise, they have got a lot of trophies. I told the guys after the gae, now you see the next step you want to take. If you want to win a championship here, if you expect to do that, there's another level we have to reach. 
>> Our identity has been that team that nobody really takes serious yet and rightfully so. We've had a couple of big games on big stages and a couple of losses on big stages, so everybody around this organization is really excited about this opportunity. 

[00:24:58]


>> We have the right gun that locker room. We have the right attitude. We have a ton of confidence. We know we're a good football team and we're playing to our expectations and to our standard. 
>> It's what football is all about, that playoff football. Cold weather football. It's just exciting. I'm getting excited talking about it. 
>> Well, arian foster mentioned the cold weather. Not today. I brought a couple of buddies from here in new england for the weather report. Collin, give me the weather report. 
>> Yeah, wicked warm, 50 degrees. 
>> This is wicked warm? 
>> Absolutely. Wicked warm, we love it. 
>> Wicked warm, texans/patriots. I've got some work to you so I'm going to throw it back to you in los angeles. Have fun. 
>> We won't even talk about that cutout behind you of jay grazer. Thanks a lot. You know, it was only five weeks ago when new england literally embarrassed the texans. 
>> Michael: They lost to the new england patriots, but they have to survive the first three offensive series from the patriots. They have to survive it. That's a confidence builder. Don't too far behind like they did in the first game. They were down 21-0 in the first half. Arian foster needs to touch the ball 25 plus times a game. 15 rushes for 46 yards last game. They need him to step up. They need every bit of j.J. Watt. They need turnovers. Batted balls need to be caught and returned for a touchdown. Anything to help put points on the board. 
>> If wade phillips looked tired in that interview, it's because he's been watching the film of that matchup in week 14. Now they get gronk back to go along with hernandez who's a matchup nightmare and play him in so many different spots. Welker, lloyd, woodhead, but i think with tom brady and bill belichick going for four, and four is rare, you're in it. Joe montana is in it. It's rare air. And the one constant with this football team that's different than the games they lost in the super bowl is the emergence of their running game with stevan idley. That's the difference maker. That was a constant in all three of their super bowl wins, their play action passing game. 

[00:27:11]


>> Curt: How is that air, t.B.? You mentioned tom brady would pass joe montana, 17 playoff victories, most in nfl history. But he's still one behind our guy t.B. With four super bowl championships. Back to today's nfc playoff matchup and the seattle seahawks who are featured in pizza hut's greatest play of the week. Now, marshawn lynch's beast of a run with some help from russell wilson will take on anquan boldin's td. 
>> Boldin has it, touchdown, ravens! 
>> Boldin climbs the imaginary laerd. 
>> A handoff to lynch, he breaks a tackle, he's down inside the 10, down to the 5, russell is blocking. Does he pile into the end zone? He does! Touchdown, seahawks. 
>> Curt: As our friends at pizza hut prepare for the big game, they want to hear you say hut, hut, hut. Send in your creative video for a chance for tv air time. Go to facebook.Com/pizzahut for details on how to enter. Your deadline, january 20th for this exciting fan contest. 
>>> All right, up next we'll have a live report from atlanta, as chris myers talks with rookie sensation russell wilson and the seahawks. Plus we'll hear from the one guy clearly on the hot seat, falcons quarterback matt ryan. Meanwhile one of the best game within the game battles, brandon browner and richard sherman against these guys, atlanta wideouts julio jones and roddy white. Just like the recent play of marshawn lynch, he's rushed for 100 or more yards in five straight games. While this could be the last time we see tony gonzalez on the football field, there's plenty MORE TO SEE OF FOX NFL SUNDAY.But does tt work for a car? Ask Scott Makowski. He and his team set out to combine power and fuel efficiency. People said it wouldn't work out. People were wrong. Here's proof. An EcoBoost engine in the new Ford Escape With up to a best-in-class 33 mpg highway, and plenty of power to spare. It's the little engine that most definitely can. The all new twenty thirteen Ford Escape. It's what happens when you Go Further. ?????? ??????

??? It seems today that all you see     Is violence in movies and sex on TV     But where are those good old-fashioned values     On which we used to rely?     Lucky there's a family guy     Lucky there's a man who positively can do     All the things that make us     Laugh and cry     He's... a... fam... ily... guy!    ??????
Wow, I'm so excited for Brian. Remember, kids-- if it's terrible, at the end, we all say, "You did it!" I can't believe we're going to the theater the same day Chris drowned a mouse in a puddle. I mean, don't we need a day to clear our heads? Boy, this takes me back. You know, I was, uh... kind of one of those theater kids in high school. 
??? Suddenly Seymour...    Suddenly Seymour...     He purified me     He purified you     Suddenly Seymour...     Suddenly Seymour...    ??????
Mrs. Andrews, I pooped in the pot again. I'm gonna need somebody to clean me up. (crying) It's really bad this time. Wow, what a turnout. Oh, hey, there's Glenn. Hey, guys. Hey, this is my date, Consuela. No, no, no. Okay, we're here 

[00:02:00]


as friends, but I'm gonna change your mind one day. (indistinct conversations) Oh, I'm so proud of Brian. It's hard to believe he's the same dog who barked at a pineapple for four hours. Close your purse. I can see your tampons. And why do you need six? What happens to you? There's the man of the hour. Hey, Brian, can you believe I found this blazer on the side of the highway? Hey, guys. Thanks for coming. Big night, Brian. How you feeling? Well, a little nervous. I just want it to go well. Fingers crossed. Will there be an intermission? Because that will determine whether or not I bring this empty Gatorade bottle into the theater. TOM: This is unacceptable! Sorry, guys, I got to go. They didn't put masking tape over a seat for Tom Tucker and he's in there pitching a fit. TOM: Do you know who I am?! I'm Tom Tucker, damn it! I make more in an hour than you make in two hours! Oh, the play's about to start. Mom, am I going to fit in the seat or is this going to be like last time? This should tide you over for a while. I'll come back as soon as I can. She's not coming back, you know. How do you know that? 'Cause she's my mom, too. Excuse me, that's my seat. We'll talk about this at home. (sighs): Let's see. Who's in this thing? Sad. Nobody. Sad. Sad. Nobody. Victor Garber? That's pretty good. How did he get Victor...? Oh, of course. Tonight it's Randall Evan Battincourt. God, I hate understudies. King Louis the Sixteenth has been sentenced to death by guillotine. (cheering) The part of King Louis the Sixteenth will be played by Jean de Menard. (crowd groans) Relax, you're going to do great. (sighs) Nailed it. Well, as usual, this is gonna suck for one of us. Donna? It's Grant, your new husband. Hi, honey. 

[00:04:00]


I've got great news. What is it? First, where do we keep the go scotch? At your brother's house. (audience laughing, Peter laughing hard) I got an audition for the hottest new play in town. This could really make my career and we can finally start our family. What's it called? A Passing Fancy. (audience gasps softly) (gasps) That's the name of this play. How did he do that? How did he do that?! Here, Donna. I got you your ten-year anniversary present. Suntan lotion? But we live in the Northeast. That's right, we do. Unless we were moving to California. (gasps) He must've got the part. When he going to meet Evita? Not every play is Evita. Oh, no. I feel terrible. Why? Don't you want to go? No-- I got you a parka. (laughing) Those two are never on the same page. Wait for the look... (audience laughing) And that's why it works. (crying) Donna, don't go! It's not too late. We can still start our family. Don't you see? You already have a family. It's right there. (audience "oohs") Those won't keep you warm at night. Good-bye, Grant. It's funny, isn't it? All these years, I was the passing fancy. (cheering) Get up, you jerk. (cheering) (cheering continues) Wow, that was amazing! I mean, usually, the shows suck in this town. Like Moishe, the low-energy Bar Mitzvah clown. Ooh, what's this? 

[00:06:02]


A quarter. I found it behind your ear earlier. All right, that's enough tricks for you. I'm going to go lie down on the coats. Hey, has anybody seen the review yet? No, we've been waiting for you. Thanks. Oh, here it is. "Here's hoping A Passing Fancy is actually a staying fancy. "The highest praise goes to playwright Brian Griffin "for his hilarious and insightful look "into modern relationships. "If you see only one play as an adult, I urge you to see this one." Hey, can you read that page with all the little paragraphs about dead people? Those are hilarious. This is amazing, Brian. How do you feel? You're a hit! It's... overwhelming. This is all I've ever wanted, you know? For people to appreciate and respect my writing. I want to write a play! (chuckles) Aw, that's cute, Stewie. Maybe someday. No, I'm going to write a play. I can do lots of things. I was the human resources director for the Muppets. Mr. Beaker, it is my unfortunate task to inform you that your services will no longer be required by this company. (unintelligible squeak) Well, if you must know, it's because we've noticed large quantities of benzene, ephedrine and everyday Epsom salt have gone missing. (unintelligible squeak) Oh, please. We both know those are the ingredients used to make crystal meth. And I've got a pretty good idea who you've been selling it to as well. Oh, hey, uh, Beaker, when you're done talking to your friend, I want to, uh, eh... I want to talk to you about that thing. Hey, what you doing? I was going to start rehearsing my new play. Want to hear it? Oh, you actually wrote a little play. Aw, boy, I wish I could hang out, but it has just gotten so crazy. Really? I know, right? I mean, I'm not complaining, you know? But I just... I want my old life back. (jokingly growls) I'm just kidding, of course. I'm so grateful, you know? I mean, every performance is sold out and they just added a Wednesday matinee. It's great. I mean, there's only one thing I'm not getting out of this experience. What's that? Sleep. (jokingly growls) No, no, I'm so grateful, really. It's just that I'm-I'm so busy all the time. But it's great. It's all great. 

[00:08:02]


Well, do you think you might have time to read it? (sighs) All right, all right. But be patient, all right? I've got interviews and appearances all week. I mean, they're squeezing every last drop they can out of me, like a bottle of ketchup. Listen, we've been at this for 15 minutes. I don't think anything's coming out. I'm fine. I can keep going. I'm just really tired. What if I stick my finger in your hole? Eh, that only works when I'm already close. The American play was dying. Have-have we brought it back to life here? I can't say that, but it has a pulse. You're such an amazing writer, Brian. How do you do it? What's your process? Oh, God, Allison, how do I even answer that? Uh, I mean, what's a rainbow's process? Two parts rain, one part sun, one part childlike wonder. What we do know, though, is that the end result in both cases is joy. Wow. Wow, are you glad you left the lighthouse now, Seamus? Oh, I think so, Seamus! Excuse me, I noticed you were talking loud, so that means you're smart. But would you mind-- and I hate asking-- but would you mind signing this? Is this guy giving you a hard time, Brian? Nah, he's all right. All right. Cool, cool. How you doing, buddy? (Mozart's 29th Symphony in A Major plays) (music builds) ! 

[00:10:05]


(music ends) My God. It's miraculous. (bleep) Hey, Brian, can you read my play? (fart noise) Sorry, there was a fart trapped in the play. dream? I'm having one right now. I don't want to be disturbed. And I won't. Because before I went to sleep, I set this. Now my iphone knows not to ring, unless it's important. 'Cause disturbing this would just be .. wrong.

Hey, Jasper, how are you? Hey, Brian! Congratulations on your new play. Oh, thanks. What's wrong? You look awful. What happened? I read the play Stewie wrote. She writes plays now? Yes, and it was brilliant. Jasper, I've never read anything like it in my life. It was insightful and fresh and intelligent. It's like his play is mocking me. He wrote it in a night. Ugh, that's how I feel whenever I see Brad Goreski on Bravo. God, everyone's on Bravo but me. Anyhoo, have you told him how good it is? No. I just read it. He gave it to me 'cause he wanted my feedback. Okay, listen to me. Tell Stewie it's awful, it's garbage. Do whatever you have to do, Brian, but never let him know he's got talent. Yeah, you're right. It won't be so hard. After all, I've certainly done worse. I replaced Peter's I Can't Believe It's Not Butter with real butter. Buh... wuh... suh... muh-wuh... I... I can't... I can't believe... Muh... wuh... (screaming) I don't know, Doctor. Looking back, I think it may have been real butter. Your husband murdered three children. Oh, my God. Look at this. Brian, get in here. What? Your play has been nominated for a local Hoggy Award for Best Creative Anything. Oh, that's great. Um, I'm gonna... I'm going to go get some air. 

[00:14:07]


Look at that. Nominated for an award. What have you two done today? I found a lump under one of my balls. Okay, that's something. I ate three quarters of an Entenmann's strudel. Youse are good kids. Hey, so did you get a chance to read my play? Uh... I did. I did. Ooh, I'm so nervous. What'd you think? Stewie, you and I are friends, right? Yeah, I mean, I know you through our mutual friend Greg, but sure, I'd say we're friends now. Exactly. And-and as your friend, you'd want me to be honest with you, right? Totally. It wasn't good. Oh, no, really? Oh, I worked so hard on it. Oh, I thought it was good. Aw. Oh, I know, I wanted it to be good so much. Oh, I am so bummed out right now. I-I... Now I don't even know if I should submit it. Wha... Submit it? Yeah, I was planning to submit it to the Roundabout Theater Company in New York. No! I mean... Oh, I mean, that-that would be a bad idea. Definitely not. No, no, they won't let you down easy like I did. New York can be pretty harsh, especially to outsiders. Hello, New York! (dragon screeching) Ugh, maybe you're right. I'll think about it. Anyway, can I have that back? It's my only copy. Your only copy? Yes. And thank you for being a good friend and telling me the truth, Brian. I know that was hard for you. And to show my appreciation for reading my play, I made you this. Wow, "good dog." And it's official? That's what it says, doesn't it? I wish my dad was alive to see this. Hey. Who the hell are you? I'm the guy Stewie pays to watch him sleep. Who are you? I'm Brian. I live here. Oh. Do you mind if I take this script? Yeah, sure, whatever. He just pays me to watch him sleep and rub this knife across my face while I do it. 

[00:16:08]


Oh. Okay. Hey, how much does Stewie pay you? $4,800 a week. (bleep) Yeah. Hey, Brian. Oh, hey, Stewie. Listen, have you seen my play? You know, Stewie, I have seen your play, and it is exhilarating to me. A child's play is one of the most beautiful things in the world. Continue to play, little one. You're our future. What the (bleep) are you talking about? The play I wrote. Have you seen it? Uh, I don't know. Let me call my lawyer. (chuckles) Hello. I'm being cross-examined. No, I haven't... I haven't seen it. Really? 'Cause I had it sitting right on my table... I said I haven't seen it, all right! And what does it matter? It was terrible anyway! We've had this conversation! Do yourself a favor and move on! Well, that's interesting, Brian, because I found this buried in the backyard next to your soup bone. (gasps) Stewie, I... You tried to destroy it, didn't you? I knew my play was good. Just like I knew your play was a mediocre patchwork of hackneyed ideas and tired clich??s. You ve no idea how hard it was to sit in that theater with all those braying hyenas. Couldn't you tell something was up when Chris and the fat man could follow the plot? I mean, it took Peter a year to figure out Stuart Little. I just figured it out. "Stuart" means "mouse." No, Peter. "Little" means "mouse"? No, Peter. I feel so old and in the way. It's still a good play! It's filled with terrible double entendres, puns and stolen bits. There's a line in there from Seinfeld! I never saw that episode! I have a voice. Do you understand that? A writer needs a voice, and I have one. You don't. Your play panders to the lowest common denominator, Brian. And it doesn't even do that well. Shut up! May every person that laughs at your sophomoric effort be a reminder of your eternal mediocrity and pierce your heart like a knife. (squirrel chittering) 

[00:18:09]


Come here, you bastard! (barking) You stink! And your play stinks! This ain't about me, is it? (sobbing) No. And I'm sorry... but nobody can ever know that. (bone cracking) Donna? It's Grant, your new husband! Hi, honey. I've got great news. What is it? First, where do we keep the good scotch? At your brother's house. (audience laughing, Peter laughing hard) Peter: Lois, can I have my birthday here? Seems to be going well. What do you want? Wanted to share a bit of good news. I just found out that my play is going to be produced on Broadway. What? And I'm taking Randall evan Battincourt with me. Hi, Stewie. I'll be right there. I just got to finish this crap. crew, Pizza Hut put all your favorites in one epic box. The Big Dinner Box is loaded with two medium pizzas, 

[00:20:11]


five breadsticks and your choice of pasta, Stuffed Pizza Rollers or wings for just $19.99. Now that's how you Make it Great. 

[00:23:00]


Hey, I need you to take me to New York for the opening night of my play. (scoffs) No way. Besides, I checked, and there's no play by Stewie Griffin opening in New York. I submitted it under a pseudonym. They think it was written by Tony Dovolani. I thought your pseudonym was Gorgeous Randy Flamethrower. That's my dodge ball pseudonym. Look, if you won't take me, I'm sure the New York Theater League would send a car. New York Theater League? Why? Because they're throwing a welcome dinner in my honor. Really? Well, I guess I could clear my schedule. Oh, you won't regret it, Brian. All the most important Broadway people will be there. Playwrights, money men, even Stanley Kowalski. Hi. I'm Michael. Michael! Michael! Um, and this is my wife, Nancy. Nancy! Nancy! And this is our Uzbekistani friend, Bokyavroychesku. Hi. (indistinct conversations) Stewie, don't you think you're overdoing it with that outfit? I don't wear anything I can't take off with a flourish. Wow, this is amazing. Every major playwright is here. Yes, and it seems to be quite a successful party. Several of them have already committed suicide. Great party. Totally! Man: Hey, Tony. Oh, my God, that's David Mamet. There's the man of the evening. I read your play, An American Marriage. It was incredibly raw. I was pretty damn impressed. Oh, thank you, David. David, this is Brian. Brian, David. Oh, it's an honor. Listen, I just want to say what an inspiration Glengarry Glen Rosswas to me when I was writing my own play. Easy. Is that Tony Dovolani? Hello. Alan Bennett. Fantastic play. And I'm Yasmina Reza. Oh, are you his night nurse? No, I'm a playwright. I wrote Artand God of Carnage. I won a Pulitzer. You want to say your grade point average, too? Boy, is just so weird to be in a room where every single person in the room is a playwright. Every single one of us. Everyone. 

[00:25:01]


Including me. I'm a playwright. Brian, my God, take it down a notch. You're a playwright? In New York? Well, Quahog, Rhode Island. You're kidding. We just went and saw a play in Quahog, Rhode Island. Really? Have you ever heard of A Passing Fancy? I have! Oh, my God, what a load of rubbish. (chuckles) We have this thing where we go to the worst regional theater we can find and laugh ourselves sick. And this one took the grand prize. (laughing) Really? I-I had heard only good things. It was a (bleep) piece of (bleep) on a (bleep)! (laughing) Oh, my God. I got to hear David Mamet curse in person. Oh, there you are. That was the worst night of my life. It's not like you were the only fat guy in there. What? Oh, this is about the play. Sorry. I was so happy until I read your play, Stewie. I finally had some kind of success as a writer. It wasn't big, but it was mine. I was fine being an okay writer, until I discovered I was living in a house with a brilliant one. I know we don't talk about doggy years a lot, but I-I just wish you could have waited to find out how talented you were until I was gone. By the time I'm dead, you won't even be ten. You'll have 70 more years to be great. I just wish I could have had five to be good. There's your voice, Brian. It's a depressing voice, but it's yours. Write from that. Listen, me and the other playwrights are going out to have drinks with Woody Allen and his daughter-wife. You want to come? All right. We can just sit here for a while. They talked a lot more crap about you after you left. Oh, God, that was just terrible. Terrible. 

[00:27:03]


I don't understand. Stewie, what happened to the play you wrote? That was terrible. Well, I gave it a final polish.. Changed a few things. Guess I kind of mucked the whole thing up. But how? You... Wait Did you do that... for me? What are you talking about? I'm a young writer. I just wasn't as ready as I thought I was. Maybe in a couple of years, who knows? Stewie, you shouldn't have done that. But... thanks. No problem, Brian. Hey, what do you say we head back home? That sounds good. You know, I'm going to move to New York City when I'm older, 'cause it's twinkly and big and this is where dreams come true, and that giant bird's coming for us, isn't he?

A fan with the right hat n party anywhere she wants. Thanks for watching "state of the union." I'm candy crowley in washington. Head to cnn.Com/sotu for extras and analysis. If you missed any part of today's show find us on itunes, just search state of the union. Fareed zakaria gps is next. 
>>> This is "gps" the global public square. Welcome to all of you in the united states and around the world. I'm fareed zakaria. We v a series of feisty debates on the hot topics of the day. We start with president obama's nomination of senator chuck hagel to be the next secretary ofense. We have a clash you will want to watch. 
>>> Then the relationship between the united states and russia keeps getting worse, whosfault is it? Moscow or washington? A debate. Also, the next fight in washington will be over the debt ceiling. Can president obama end this craziness and bypass congress altogether? We'll talk about the out of the box solutions and whether they would work. 
>>> And, finally, this is the signature of the man who might be the next treasury secretary. We'll look back through history to see if there's any loopy president. Speaking of secretaries of the treasury three former holders of the office and many other statesmen and women offering advice to the president on a new gps special tonight "memo to the president, road map for a second term." Tonight at 8:00 p.M. And 11:00 p.M. Eastern and pacific. 
>>> First, here's my take. Chuck hagel's nomination as america's next secretary of defense has drawn fire from people who say he's outside of the main stream. In fact, he's a pretty straight forward, traditional republican on most issues with a reluctance to go to war, born of knowledge and experience. Where hagel does appear out of the mainstream in washington's world of group think is on iran. Which I would argue is a good thing because washington desperately needs fresh thinking on the topic. In 2013, president obama will face a crisis with regard to iran. He has categorically ruled out containing an iran with nuclear weapons. So, either iran will capitulate completely to american demands or the united states will go to war with that country. Since the first option is extremely unlikely and the second extremely unattractive, the obama administration needs to see if there is a path through which it can pressure iran to make a deal. In a thoughtful essay in the current issue of "foreign affairs" the columbia scholar jurvis points out that this kind of coercive diplomacy, at least from washington, has rarely worked. He points out in panama, 1989, iraq, 1990, serbia, 1998, afghanistan, 2001 and iraq, 2003, washington tried sanctions pressure and the threat of force to get leaders to change course, it didn't work. And washington had to make good on its threat to go to war. With north korea, coercive diplomacy also failed, but in this case, washington decided against military action choosing, instead, to contain the regime. Making coercive diplomacy requires a mix of threats and promises. With regard to iran, the administration has made the threats plenty of times. With clarity and credibility. But while the sticks have been handled shrewdly, the carrots have not. The united states is unable to define for itself or for the world what would be an acceptable deal and, most importantly, what it is willing to do if ta ron agrees to such a deal? Would sanctions be lifted? Which ones? Would the u.S. Stop its efforts to overthrow the regime? Would it be willing to discuss normalization of relations with iran? There have been many obstacles in the path of a deal from the iranian side. But a former state department official writing in the cairo review of global affairs points out that tehran has recently signaled its willingness to compromise. He notes that numerous western, chinese and russian officials have acknowledged that the iranians focus their bottom line on uranium enrichment at 3.5% level and sanctions relief. Iran's enrichment of uranium to the 20% level, corresponding stockpile and underground nuclear facility are all fair game for compromise, but for the right price. So, let's try to find a price that makes a deal attractive to the iranians and to us. There are also real obstacles to a negotiated deal in washington and that is where chuck hagel's voice could make a difference. We need to make an offer that tehran can accept and that we feel comfortable with. Otherwise, 2013 will be the year that we accepted a nuclear iran or we went to war. For more on this, you can read my column in this week's "time" magazine. Let's get started. 

[00:05:12]


>>> When president obama chose the conservative republican for the post of defense secretary, you might not have expected opposition from the right, but you would have been wrong. While many conservatives support hagel's nomination, there is spirited opposition from the right. Perhaps the first public opposition to chuck hagel was a column in "wall street journal" by its foreign affairs columnist bret stephens. He leveled a charge against the former senator, one of the first full throated defenses of hagel came in the "daily beast" from the editor of that website's blog and the author of the "crisis of zionism." Joining me now bret stephens and peter beinart. Brett, let's start with you, you essentially accused chuck hagel of being an anti-semite. 
>> I said there was an odor of prejudice. 
>> What evidence do you have THATs IS THE CASE? 
>> He had this famous statement that I'm sure you heard several times by now about the jewish lobby intimidating a lot of people. A lot of that discussion about that quote had to do with this line, the jewish lobby. As opposed to say the pro-israel lobby which is a very diverse collection of organizations. Some of them with very different motives. What got me really wasn't so much the adjective, although i found the adjective odd, it was the verb, intimidates. Chuck hagel for 12 years was a senator fr state of nebraska. I looked it up. There are about 6,100 jews in the state of nebraska. I can imagine many lobbies that might have intimidated hagel when he was in the senate. The ethanol lobby, for example, the farm lobby, various other kinds of lobbies. The nra, the pro-life lobby and so on. It's hard to see how he levels a charge that this lobby intimidates people. Now, are there pro-israel groups that are lobbying on behalf of israel? Absolutely. Are there dozens, if not hundreds of lobbies in washington operating in the same way all the time. So, this peculiar charge that this particular jewish lobby intimidates senators was something I found very disturbing and, obviously, not alone in this view. 

[00:07:26]


>> But you have writing in the "times" essentially about your column. It is bullying and name calling to denounce people as antisemitic because they won't embrace the policies of a far right israeli government that regularly shoots itself in the foot. In a world in which anti-semitism actually does persist this is devaluing the term so that it becomes simply glib right wing insult. 
>> To be pro-israel is to be this far right, netanyahu and people even further to his right. That's simply just not true. That is simply a character. By the way, absolutely. The term anti-semitic unfair. But that does not mean that anti-semitism doesn't exist and that doesn't mean that statements that kind of approach a kind of anti-semitism aren't out there either. I didn't call him an anti-semite. I said there was an odor of prejudice. This is something he has to address. Many other reasons, by the way, I oppose hagel's nomination. But that is -- 
>> wait a second. The column is titled "chuck hagel's jewish problem." And you, you level this charge. As far as I know, you didn't call hagel to ask him. You didn't call any jew in nebraska and call the rabbi in omaha who calls the charge extremely stupid. You didn't call the head of the jewish federation of omaha, nebraska, that said the charge is absurd. I say this as a jew, we should have much higher standards than this kind of cavalier defamation of people because you didn't like one phrase they uttered seven or eight years ago. Lobbies intimidate people. That's part ofhat they do. Whether it's the gun lobby or health carlobby or unions. They're in the business of doing that. To say that because chuck hagel said it's true about the pro-israel lobby and used the term jewish lobby, which I agree is inaccurate which was also used by the head of the conference of presidents of major jewish organizations last december, i really think was extremely unfortunate and I really hope you'll think again before doing so in the future. 

[00:09:33]


>> Again, you responded to my column by accusing me of being completely indifferent when it came to ts subjects of homophobia. 
>> I said you have a different standard. 
>> You said that I didn't write about these subjects. I demonstrated -- 
>> no. I said you a different standard and you do have a different stdard. 
>> I demonstrated to you that i do. I do care about anti-semitism 
>> as do i. 
>> And people should stand up and say, this is extremely -- you know, this is extremely worrisome. This raises eyebrows. Is it dispositive? No. But it ought to raise eyebrows. What I am stunned by. People moved to hagel's defense largely because he takes views that are not necessarily congenial to israel, including a lot of jews. People should -- 
>> wait. Barack and israel's deputy foreign minister have both said he's a friend to israel. So, I don't know who it is who is exactly saying he's not a friend to israel. Those people seem to have a lot of credibility on the subject. 
>> You think his views on israel and the middle east are ones, you think the united states should be following more closely. 
>> I think the important thing about having, is in a way, he would be the obama administration's mayor dugan. He is the guy in israel from the national security establishment who pushed back when benjamin netanyahu he felt was talking too cavalierly about the prospect of war against iran. Hagel has not ruled out military force against iran. He ruled it in in an op-ed last fall. He said, again and again, very eisenhower ways. As you've made the point, eisenhower was always saying, let's nopretend we can control war once it's unleashed. That's the point that hagel made again and again. I want that perspective in the iran debate. I think that's part of what makes it important. 
>> What I find striking about this debate and this, I think, hopefully brings us to the larger debate about chuck hagel's world view is that if you are a skeptic of intervention, u.S. Intervention in iran and certainly if you're against israeli military intervention in iran, as I think you are, peter, you couldn't possibly send a worst signal than to appoint chuck hagel as your defense secretary. You know, "new york times" has a profile of shimon perez that was done back in july of last year before the election. It's about how the president of israel largely symbolic position, adamantly opposed an israeli strike because he said, i guarantee you, if it comes to it, the americans are going to do it. So, a lot of the israeli calculation back in september and october when they were thinking about a strike was, no, let's hold off because we have some confidence that the obama administration, if it comes to it, we'll do it. If it's necessary. A lot of the people who supported president obama said, "mark my words. He is a man of his word, he does this quite seriously." Then he turns around and appoints perhaps the most prominent skeptic of any kind of military intervention in iran as his defense secretary. If you're siing in israel, you're wondering just how reliable is the united states and maybe we should go it alone. So, for that reason alone, simply the appointment of chuck hagel is going to make the israelis more skittish and perhaps more prone to act. 

[00:12:53]


>> Here's the irony. Who said that military action against iran could prove catastrophic? That was robert gates. Our former defense secretary. Who said that it could embroil us in a conflict that we can forget? That was leon panetta. The guy he's replacing. It was true, bret, I think you are right that we need the military option on the table as hagel has repeatedly said. But that surely can't mean we can't have a public conversation in this country about the tremendous dangers that war would bring. That to me is absolutely a conversation we have to have and being led by the pentagon because it's people in the u.S. Military who are most concerned about this. 
>> All right, we're going to have to leave it at that and we will have a chance to have both of you back to have another spirited conversation. Peter beinart, bret stephens, thanks for joining us. 
>>> Up next, a new kind of cold war. The participants are the same, the weapons this time are legislation. What is going on? We will tell you. Morning starts in high spirits, but there's a growing pain in his lower back. As lines grow longer, his pain continues to linger. But after a long day of helping others, he gets some helpful advice.

>>> Relations between washington and moscow have reached a new low. Bringing back memories of the cold war. The current fit for tat started when the u.S. Congress passed the black list russian officials alleged to have been involved in the death of russian lawyer bans them from coming to the united states and freezes their assets. A broader list than that. Russia responded with a ban on u.S. Adoptions from russia and a threat to bar u.S. Human rights abuses. Some say this is all evidence of a new cold war. Stephen cohen is a professor at nyu and william brodeur was an ambassador in russia, and was his former employer and he is, of course, one of the biggest proponents behind the magnitsky act. Welcome to you both. 
>> Thank you. 
>> William, explain the importance of the act from your point of view? 
>> Very simply, it is a piece of legislation which is sort of desied for the modern day problems of what's going on in russia. In russia, you have a regime which is basically out to steal as much money as possible from their own people. In response to that, when people try to stop it in any way, like sergei magnitsky, they get killed. What the act does is it creates consequences for the corrupt murdering kelp to crates running russia today and creates consequences outside of russia by banning their visas and freezing their assets in america. 
>> Steve cohen, you disagree with the magnitsky act. Do you wish congress hadn't passed it? 

[00:18:24]


>> I do for many reasons, but as you said in your introduction i think moscow and washington are sliding into a new cold war, which would be very bad for national security and the magnitsky act further poisons the relationship. Mr. Browder is right to a certain extent, but not quite as simple as he says. Even though this may be this act just a lot of words, it will have consequences. For example, there are groups in moscow and in the united states that have a whole list of names that they want to put on this black list. There are even people who want to put putin's name on it on the ground that he abused civil liberties. What would that mean for the relationship between president obama and putin, if they want to have an urgent meeting, let's say in the united states about missile defense or syria. This is a kind of cold war atmospheric poisoning that we don't need at this time. 
>> William, what do you think of this adoptions issue? Why did they choose it and what effect do you think it will have? 
>> Well, very simply, what it shows in the most harsh way is what putin is really all about. So, the magnitsky act came about and the russians said we have to react to it. They looked at the possible reactions. One reaction would be to sanction american businesses, but then putin looked at it and said that might harm my own pocketbook. Then they said maybe we'll do some type of reaction in terms of foreign policy. When they looked at the sort of portfolio of how they could react, what they realized is there was really nothing they could not cooperate on because they are not cooperating at the moment already. They looked through their portfolio and said, wait a second. One thing americans want which we have, they want to adopt our disabled orphans. They said, let's take that away from them. Not even looking for a second at what that meant for these unbelievably vulnerable children. And, so, essentially what it shows is the absolute sort of lack of morales of vladimir pewter. 

[00:20:34]


-- Putin. 
>> Steven, isn't it fair to say that russia seems to be in some -- along some of these dimensions moving backwards, that is, that there is less freedom of speech, civil society, and the state seems more abusive than certainly people like you had hoped ten years ago? 
>> Certainly more than I had hoped. Speaking historically, since i am a historian, russian is now in one of its periodic cycles of repressive politics from the taliban. 
-- From the top. There's no doubt about that. But in the context of russia's history, it's a very mild cycle of repression, and it's accompanying, interestingly enough, from putin, from the kremlin, by a certain opening up of the political system, including the electoral system. But I want to come back to something mr. Browder said about putin. I don't know where he gets his information but there are very good sources that say something quite different. First of all at the beginning, putin didn't like this ban on american adoptions of russian orphans and, in fact, foreign minister, who rarely strays from putin, opposed it. Things ran out of putin's control, I think. Secondly, to say that russia is not cooperating in foreign affairs with america is an astonishing statement. We are nearly largely dependent on russia for supplying nato troops in afghanistan. Russia could have slowed in retaliation to the magnitsky bill. That supply route. There were many things russia could have done. This is, even though it's obscene and it's bad, it's tragic. It's one of the mildest things russia could have done. 
>> Since I have you both here, i have to ask you. William, what do you make of the other news out of russia? Girard depardieu deciding to take russian citizenshi are the french moving to russia? 

[00:22:36]


>> Well, I think there's one or two french people to russia gerard depardieu and I think bridget is very upset about the euthanasia of two elephants at the zoo and she's threatening to move to russia, as well. I don't think she's aware of the unbelievable animal cruelty they do in russia. Just to put some perspective on it. There are about 3 million educated russians who have left russia and emigrated and the retrograde society that they have there and putin needed some kind of pr stunt and he gets this sort of silly character to take russian citizenship and puts him up on stage and hope that swill somehow dissuade everybody from leaving russia. I think -- I don't think it served its purpose. 
>> Stephen, is it a sign of anything? Or just fun and games? 
>> It is fun and games and quite silly. It has two potential serious consequences. First of all, it draws more attentn in russia to putin's 13% flat tax. I mean, that is a very low tax in a country where inequality of income is just gigantic. Right up there with america's inequality of income. There is a lot of resentment among ordinary russians are people who are making millions and millions of dollars a year in russia are paying only 13%. There's another side potential consequence. Putin, russia is turning east. It's turning away from europe and that's the subject of a much longer discussion. But, putin, russia's two main allies in europe have been germany and france. The german relationship has soured. The french relationship has not soured. But if this goes down, this act or stunt of taking russia, by the way, he's not going to live in russia. He just took the passport. But if this goes down badly in france, for any reason, it will further fray russia's ties with the west and russia's turn to the east. That's not good for any of us, i think. 

[00:24:50]

[00:28:46]


>>> Now for our what in the world segment. For 14 years, hugo chavez has been a troubling global presence. He has been an avowed critic of american capitalism and yet he has billions from selling oil to the united states, and he is a populist who some revere and others despise. One thing for sure, venezuela's president is a fighter. Last year it seemed like he had even defeated cancer but the cancer is back and chavez is said to be gravely ill. The newly re-elected president hasn't been seen for a month so when he couldn't attend his own swearing in ceremony on thirds, it sparked a natural set of questions in venezuela and around the world. What's next? Whoever inherits the presidency, chavez will cast a long shadow. Look at his record. On the one hand, the poorest are actually better off. According to the center for economic policy and research, poverty has declined by 50% since 2004. Extreme poverty has declined by 70%. Over the same period, college enrollment doubled and millions of venezuelans gained access to health care. Many are getting free housing. Chavez announced on public television last year, he will build 2 million homes for poor. But look deeper and you'll see that the programs that created these gains are built on an oil boom. They are badly designed and they are damaging the venezuelan economy. The economy is, frankly, in shambles. Barclay's research puts venezuela's annual fiscal deficit at nearly 20% of gdp, one of the highest imbalances in the world. Total debt has more than doubled since 2008. And that is despite the fact that venezuela has the greatest proven reserves of oil in the world. More than saudi arabia, iran or canada. When hugo chavez first came to power in 1999, oil was trading at $11 a barrel. Today, it is trading at $111 a barrel. Chavez has presided over the greatest windfall in his country's history. And, yet, venezuela is probably the only petro state in the world where people regularly suffer power outages. Infrastructure is crumbling and public security is abysmal. Venezuela has one of the worst homicide rates in the world, worse even than colombia, honduras and mexico. A recent foreign affairs essay pointed out that venezuelan exports to the u.S. From the start of chavez's rule through 2011 added up to nearly $350 billion. That's iconic for a presidency which marketed itself as anti-american. But even that trend may be reversing. According to a "financial times" report for every 10 barrels of crude that are exported to the united states, venezuela now needs to import two back because it lacks refining capacity, which has been made worse by a recent explosion at a venezuelan refinery. In other words, america is selling oil to venezuela. Meanwhile, chavez continues to ship a reported 100,000 barrels of subsidized crude oil to cuba every day. Venezuela's people have gotten used to tall promises, free housing, essentially free gasoline and increasingly, the state cannot afford it. It's popular to be anti-american and, yet, the money has been coming in from washington. Cuba remains a staunch ally, but if it stops receiving cheap oil, it will pull out its tens of thousands of doctors from venezuela, which will destroy venezuela's health care system. All these years a popular hugo chavez has been masking all these flaws in his economy using oil wealth. But the problems are building. The next leader of venezuela will face the build up of all these problems and probably without chavez's charisma or guile. If you think balancing the budget in washington is difficult, spare for what caracas will have to do in the coming years.

>>> Up next, the war in afghanistan told through the lens of one deadly battle. That's the story behind a great recent book "the outpost." I'll speaks to the author jake tapper up next.

Tapper has, of course, covered the white house for abc news for the past four years and will soon be an anchor here at cnn as well as our chief washington correspondent. Welcome to cnn. And welcome to "gps." 

[00:37:03]


>> Thanks, fareed, it's a pleasure. 
>> Fascinating book. You know, to me, the stories you tell, as you say, it is a microcosm. One of them, they go to this village, the american troops go to this village in nuristan and insurgents streaming in from the border and one of the villagers asked them, are you soviets? Are you soviet soldiers? And the american starts to explain to them, that the soviets left, the soviet union collapsed, and there isn't any soviet union anymore. You're dealing with remote parts of the world where they just -- to what extent do they understand why we are in afghanistan? 
>> Right. I mean, that's the amazing thing. Obviously, not only are the u.S. Troops that have been sent to this part of the world not fighting al qaeda, they are involved with a population that has never heard of the world trade center, that some of them know of the world trade center, but they thought the world trade center was in response to the americans invading afghanistan. So, how much theirction is connected to what happened on 9/11 is very much in doubt. But you're right, I do see it as a microcosm because you have brave troops performing heroically doing everything that is asked of them in that corner of the world and some of them make a difference and some win over the population, but, ultimately, it is a very, zery impossible task for them to do without sufficient assets and sufficient man power and the mission keeps changing. 
>> When you talk about the, you know, these, the winning over the population. What I wonder about is, at some point you leave and the realities on the ground reemerge, don't you think? 
>> Absolutely. In fact, when I went to that part of the world, not last year, in 2011, that's what a villager in this one town that is focused on in the book says that they were always stuck between the americans and the insurgents and they knew who was going to be there in five years. Insurgents were going to be there, americans were not. Another thing that is interesting is, when they push into this part of the country, regional command east, eastern afghanistan, which is, obviously, an incredibly dangerous part of the country, of the war. It's not until 2006. So, the war has been going on for more than four years, almost five years even before we really even go into that part of the country. The colonel in charge of it at the time which is now general McNICHOLSON, HE KNOWS THAT A Counterinsurgency strategy needs 14 years to work. 14. Does anybody in the u.S. Think that when they push it in 2006, 2006 that we're still going to be there in 2020? You know? 

[00:39:56]


>> The place that you're looking at is very close to pakistan and that's where the insurgents are coming from. They take safe harbor in pakistan. Was there talk about how at the end, that is the crux of the problem. You are never going to be able to destroy this insurgency because it houses itself and gets replenished in a foreign country. 
>> All the time. In fact, pakistan is mentioned so many more times in the book than bin laden or al qaeda. It's like, you know, the enemy that dare not speak its name for the u.S. They do what they can do. Obviously, the drone wars are being fought independent and separate in many ways. But, it's not just weapons and bad guys that are coming over the border, it's expertise. It's sharp shooters and snipers and people who teach the locals HOW TO BUILD IEDs. 
>> The thing that struck me about this is because all great stories about war often get, make you understand the disconnect between the very grand plan strategies at the top, even at the level of general McChrystal and company and what it translates into for the guy. On the ground actually doing it. And I got a sense that those guys, american soldiers good guys trying to do their best, but there was such a big disconnect. 
>> It's unbelievable and it starts with the fact that they didn't have enough assets. It's not just a question of they needed more troops in afghanistan in 2006. Although, probably any general would have argued that. And did. But they didn't have helicopters. They didn't have enough helicopters. So, when you don't have enough helicopters, you make decisions along the lines of, well, we're going to set up an outpost in this part of the country, which is very mountainous. We need to be near the road. We have to be near the road. That's the only way to resupply it because we don't have helicopters. That ends up costing people their lives.

[00:44:21]


>>> Twitter and the blogosphere lit up this week with an idea of how the president can get past the debt limit without congress. It seems an obscure paragraph allows the treasury secretary to mint a platinum coin of any denomination. The theory goes the treasury secretary can mint a trillion dollar platinum coin and use it to get a trillion dollars worth of credit at the fed? Will it work and how about some more realistic ideas for getting through our next crisis. Joining me now jeff toobin, cnn senior legal analyst and bruce bartlett. The columnist and former treasury official in the reagan administration. Jeff, quickly, the trillion dollar coin, this isn't going to work, is it? 
>> Legally, I think it could work. I think the law is unlike many laws, actually very clear. This is something that is within the secretary of the treasury's authority. He could issue this coin and it would get the u.S. Government past the immediate stumbling block of the failure to raise the debt ceiling. That's a legal matter. As a political matter, I think it's basically a nonstarter because it seems comical and it seems ridiculous. 

[00:46:47]


>> Bruce, you suggest an alternate strategy which is one bill clinton has talked about and colombia law professors do. Which is the president should essentially say, I have the implicit authority to raise the debt ceiling without congress, correct? 
>> That's right. Of course, I'm not a legal scholar, but I do oppose the existence of the debt limit. I even testified before the senate finance committee that we should get rid of it. I think it's a dreadful left over from ancient history that simply creates opportunities for hostage taking by congress, such as the one we're facing right now and our foreign policy, we don't negotiate with hostage takers for a very good reason and I think that we need to get rid of this debt limit. But I'm perfectly willing to go along with the trillion dollar coin, if that's what's necessary to prevent this hostage from being taken. 
>> So, jeff, take us through the constitutional argument here because the, as I understand it, the point would be the president would say to congress, by choosing to set taxes at a certain level and give us revenues at this level and by choosing to spend at a higher level, you are implicitly authorizing me to go out and borrow money, which I have to do as president to ensure that the laws are faithfully executed. 
>> Correct. There is a provision of the 14th amendment to the constitution which one could argue implies that the president has to pay the debts. And he could simply ignore the debt limit to ignore the law and simply order the treasury bonds to be sold. Interestingly, the obama administration, jay carney, the press secretary, has ruled out that approach. He has ruled out the unilateral use of the 14th amendment. 

[00:48:49]


>> Is the 14th amendment a weak argument? 
>> I think it's a lot more ambiguous, whether the president has that authority. That would be something he would be arguing is implicit in the 14th amendment, but it is far from obvious that that is one of his powers. The coin is very specific power. Granted to the treasury secretary in a law passed by congress and signed by a president many years ago. So, I think just on a strictly legal basis, he'd be on a lot firmer ground, if he does the coin, than if he did the 14th amendment approach. 
>> Bruce, you, again, predicted that this would be the big fight. That the fiscal cliff would not be the real issue. The debt ceiling would be. You see this as taking us close to the brink, again. Could it take us over the brink? 
>> Potentially. Keep in mind that we have two other -- in addition to the debt limit, we have, in effect, two other fiscal cliffs approaching. One is the appropriations bills for 2013, which have not yet been finished and we'll have a government shutdown unless they have, unless those bills are enacted and the second is the $1.2 trillion sequester, which triggered the fiscal cliff, but was only delayed by two months and that runs out, as well. So, we have the debt limit, the the sequester and the appropriations. All essentially coming due at more or less the same date. My assumption is and I guess everybody else's is, is these will all be rolled into together into one massive punt the ball down the road bill. 
>> Jeff, if any of this does end up in the supreme court, you know, the administration does some kind of legal maneuver. What's the history of this one. An executive legislative battle. Do they say, this is political, this is not constitutional? 
>> Most of the time, in circumstances like this. Where you have the president and the legislative branch fighting as they often have throughout history, the court tries to stay out of it and says this is a political question. We're not going to get involved. One the very unsettled legal issues here, is we talk about the legality of the coin or of the 14th amendment. There's a legal doctrine called standing, who has the right to sue and it's far from clear that anybody has the right to sue. So we could have a discussion about this. But frankly, if the president does either of these things, it probably would never even be decided by a court. That a court would simply say look, nobody has standing to challenge this. It's a political issue, you, political branches figure it out, we're going to stay uninvolved. 

[00:51:41]


>> Which means if you think this is such a bad idea, try to impeach the president. 
>> Exactly. That would be the remedy unlikely. But not the supreme court wagging its finger and saying, you can't do that. 
>> For everyone who thought we had gotten through the crisis with the fiscal cliff, thank you for joining me. We'll be right back. I've always had to keep my eye on her... But, I didn't always watcout for myself. With so much noise about health care... I tuned it all out. With UnitedHealthcare, I get information that matters... My individual health profile. Not random statistics. They even reward me for addressing my health risks. So I'm doing fine... but she's still going to give me a heart attack.

>>> The tube, london's underground celebrated its 150th birthday this week. It started with just a four-mile stretch and is the oldest subway system in the world. That brings me to my question of the week -- which city can claim the biggest subway system in the world, measured by length? Is it a, beijing, b, new york, c, london or d, moscow? Stay tuned, we'll tell you the correct answer, go to cnn.Com/fareed. And follow us on twitter or subscribe to us on facebook. If you miss a show, go to itunes. This week's book of the week is an e-book, david frum's "why romney lost" he is a conservative who believes that president obama was vulnerable and could have been beaten. But he details how the republican party blew it. Trapped in a cocoon of tv commentators and consultants who fed it fantasies. It is very smart and it is quite short. 
>>> Now, for the last look. Much has been made of the signature of jacob lew, who if confirmed will be the nation's next treasury secretary. This could be on our currency. But on deeper examination, it seems that might never happen. Tim geithner's regular signature is this. But he says he changed it to this, more ledgible version to sign your dollar bills. We asked a few of our favorite formers if their signatures on greenbacks were their regular signatures or whether they had changed them. Robert reuben said nobody ever asked him to do so. But he, too, changed his signature for public consumption. His john hancock for correspondenced on this one for cash. James baker's signature on a speed ticket. In his later years, he altered his penmanship on his middle initial and switched from junior to the iii. And paul o'neill says he would not change his signature even for the mighty dollar. By the way secretaries reuben, baker and o'neill will all be on a gps special tonight called "memo to the president: Roadmap for a second term." They and a whole host of others will offer advice to the president on how to navigate the gridlock in washington and more. Tonight at 8:00 and 11:00 p.M. Pack on cnn. 

[00:58:32]


>>> The correct answer to our gps challenge question was a, beijing, it is 442 kilometers long and has six million daily users. The second biggest subway system in the world is also in china, it is shanghai. London and new york come third and fourth respectively. Thanks to all of you for being part of my program this week. I will see you next week.

=======================================================

>> Welcome to first. I am shirley mann along with michelle and mark. 
>> They are getting a push from the new health care act. We have a look at how delaware health officials are helping efforts. Wilmington's new mayer is setting an agenda for the next four years, we will look at what the hopes are for the city's two most visible areas. Downtown ant riverfront. 
>> We have conversations with rob, the stay of play gang and jay watson. And experience with unique products. "First," your public media news magazine stars now. 
>> With all the talk about health care reform, the idea of keeping people well instead of treating illnesses is a recurring theme. One of those efforts getting support from the white house is to encourage more moms to breast feed their infants. According to the centers for disease control, breast feeding rates are on the rise nationally and in delaware. Our first look shows how delaware's women, infants and children program is stepping up its breast feeding campaign as it tries to weeden more of its moms off formula. 
>> First-time mom ashley knew before ella was born she wanted to breast feed. But wanting and doing are two different things. 
>> It was dficult. We had to learn how to latch, and how to nurse properly. And then we struggled with some weight gain issues. 
>> Now, nine months old, ella is thriving and exclusively breast fed. 
>> When people say breast feeding is natural, yes, it is, but that doesn't mean there isn't a learning curve. 
>> She isn't the only one who struggled. 

[00:02:02]


>> No one in my family breast feed. When I said I wanted to, it was looked down upon. They didn't think it was going to work. 
>> Erica and ashley turneded to katie, a registered nurse and board certified lack takes consultant. She leads a weekly breast feeding support group in wilmington. 
>> The women I deal with have a good intention. They start out strong with good intention, and then the support isn't there to maintain. 
>> Breast feeding is hard enough, and her clients have the social network, the work environment and the means to continue breast feeding. Resources other moms might not have. 
>> When I talk to my friends, and I know they have done the whole w.I.C. Thing, a lot of times it is a matter of they are going to take whatever they can go. 
>> W.I.C., Short for women, infants and children, is a governmental program to supplement moms with things like formula and lots of it. 
>> We are giving breast feeding support and encouragement. 
>> She is the coordinator. 
>> Breast offsiding is an excellent start in life no matter what background you are from. It levels the playing field. 
>> The american academy of pediatrics recommends exclusively breast feeding for at least six months, a tough goal especially when madden says the cards are stacked against you. 
>> You are looking at a population that often doesn't have the best work conditions, and those women need a good electric breast pump to maintain lack takes len they go back to work, and that is not feasible for a lot of women. Even if they opt to breast feed right off the bat, they are looking at probably switching to formula when they go back to work. 
>> Breast feeding protects your baby from obesity and diabetes. 
>> Delaware ace division of public health is working overtime to provide every resource it can to help moms breast feed as mandated by president obama. These are part of the breast feeding campaign. 

[00:04:13]


>> Lot more people are seeing our commercials, and we have seen an increase in our exclusive bread feeding. 
>> She says that 50% of delaware moms are exclusively breast feeding, no formula, double the national numbers from 2012. Along with the pregame, they allow access for clines to breast pump. They have places set up throughout the state where women can pump that is not the bathroom as required by federal law. Lewis says most importantly her program provides peer counseling 24/7678 
>> peer support is what has worked for us. A mother helping a mother through a hard situation. 
>> Support madden and all of her moms agree is critical for any breast feeding mom. 
>> Breast feeding isn't easy, but it is worth it. It is like going to the gym, eating healthy. It is the type of can't you have to work towards and sometimes isn't the most fun thing to do, but overall it is the best for your heaest four baby's health. One of the most amazing experiences you will have as a woman and mother. 
>> The division of hub health adds as more moms breast feed, they are healthier, their children are healthier and that saves tax payers money. Breast feeding does not work for everyone for a number of reasons. There is a place for formula. 
>> Hospitals are getting on board, becoming more baby friendly. 
>> Basically, hospitals can't give away formula. They have to have a certain number of lack takes consultants on hand, and they don't separate moms and babies anymore unless there is is a reason. They are all working towards compliance. 
>> Despite the beaven fits there, is controversy surrounding breast feeding, especially in public. 

[00:06:13]


>> There was an incident in the concord mall in wilmington. Some moms said they were harassed by security despite a state law that protects them. They say that breasts are hyper sexualized in the u.S. 
>> We will have more on our website, newsworks .Org/delaware. The change of the the guard. The administration of dennis women's is under way and it comes with a lot of hope and promise. 
>> Hey, welcome. 
>> Thank you. 
>> Good morning. 
>> How does it feel, dennis? 
>> A happy dennis women's walking to the city/county background for his dede as wilmington -- for the first day as mayor. Not that far out of sight a copy of the 2012 budget, a symbol of what awaits him. Women's is faced with wanting to change -- williams is faced with changing what he wants done. 
>> Once I go through every department and get a comfortable feeling for everybody, what they do and why they do, we can do it better. 
>> We can start doing that. 
>> Then I will start going outside the building. 
>> His day wraps up before the people who could be his best friends or his toughest audience, the city council. 
>> We have a gun problem in this city that is beyond reproach. We have a homicide in this city beyond reproach. A city with a 9.5-mile geographical area. It is totally ridiculous for the crime problem to be in a city so small. 
>> Another point he made as well. 
>> This administration will be open, fair, honest, and we want to be a team player. We want to work with everyone. We want to work with city council. We want to work with them side by side to get this city turned around. 

[00:08:25]


>> The mayor's day started at the east side charter school, where williams took the oath of office. 
>> I will always uphold and defend the constitution of my country and my state and the city of charter, so help me, god. 
>> So help me, god. 
>> Congratulations. 
[Cheers and applause] 
>> and all this on his birthday. ?????? Happy birthday ???????????? ?????? happy birthday ???????????? 
>> the obvious question is what kind of change can mayor williams make in the short term and long-term for wilmington. We thought we would get perspective from our newest contributor, john watson. Michelle joins us for this segment as well. Welcome, john. Thanks for being here. 
>> Well, it's nice to be here. 
>> First impressions of this inaugural week for mayor williams. 
>> He keeps saying, and i believe him, when he says it's a new day. It's really a new day. The only problem he has, it seems as though he is not well organized here. One day he says one thing and the next day the other. But you've got this transition thing going on, and when mayer baker was mayor, my understanding is he never did a transition. He is quoted in the news journal as saying transitions can be very, very complicated. So we should kind of -- instead of criticizing the new mayor, mayor dennis williams, we should give him a break. He has been transitions. It started in august. 
>> So shouldn't the barb set higher for him because he has had sort of an unprecedented amount of time to get things together? 
>> Well, that is a good argument you could make against him. So being that long, taking all that amount of time, it sounds like he is not well organized. It really does. 

[00:10:31]


>> And he said a number of times -- he said it when he won the primary, that wilmington would be a safer city in six months. 
>> And you wouldn't recognize the city in two years. 
>> Is he setting the bar too high for himself? 
>> He may find that it is too high for himself. But you have to remember that after all, he was a police detective. So he knows how to fight crime. 
>> Can you think of another time in the city's recent history similar to what wilmington fes now? 
>> I have a really good answer for you. What is going on now, I've seen it before. It is repeating itself. The cycle repeats itself. The problem with the budget for the city, oblem with crime in the city. It seems to me like nothing has changed. That is why people are repeating what the new mayor is saying. It's a new day. Well, it seems to me he is going to have to prove a lot to make sure that we see that, hey, it really is a new day. You see, it's nice to have a slogan. But then you have to live up to it. 
>> You have to back it up. Let's hope the good times will cycle back around as well. 
>> Exactly. Otherwise it is going to be the same old thing over and over again. 
>> John watson, thank you for being here. Now called newsworks.Org/delaware as one of the many places you can find him these days. We will see you next week in dover. One of the issues facing mayor williams is how to keep the core of wilmington going ahead. There is a lot of new construction happening along market street and through the central business district area. The riverfront is again going through a growth spurt as well. But what can people expect to see a year or even five years from now in the city? One group things you may be surprised. 

[00:12:41]


>> Over the past three years streets have changed in downtown wilmington. But for the better. Especially since the number of people living here has increased from 0 it 2,000 during that period. But city officials would like to see more growth, and possibly wilmington as it was in the past. 50 years ago most of the merchants and their families lived in the second and third flores above their stores. Well, for the last 40 or 50 years or so, these have been vacant spaces. We hope to return that again to housing. 
>> In order to get people interested again, store fronts are getting makeovers. 
>> For the longest team, the security gates have come down. We are removing those, making it a beautiful atmosphere, redoing the building facade. It is inviting. 
>> New features are going up, leaving many people who support the project. 
>> We expect to have 5,000 people living downtown. We expect downtown wilmington to be the premier address with 100% ack pennies, new businesses, retail, culture and the arts. 
>> Speaking of art, the delaware college of art design and vision helps to increase foot traffic downtown. Take the old brandywine hotel, which has been converted to school housing. Plus, the school plans to turn this empty space into a store. 
>> First of all, wilmington has a driving force in its local economy in the arts. It's true with the world cafe live, true with the organizations downtown. We have an art school that is downtown. We are going to have an art supply store that is downtown. This is all money that comes to the city right downtown from arts organizations. 

[00:14:46]


>> Blocks away from downtown, plans to transform the riverfront into a destination spot continue as well. There is now a movie theater and hotel being built. But making the area more accessible is key. 
>> One of the key things that will happen and will begin in about a year is the construction of a bridge to link the riverfront area to route 13, providing a new route of entrance and egress to the already developed area. 
>> The goal is also to promote residential living there as well. 
>> There will be a new apartment building. They have broken ground, but they are not actually doing the construction yet, but will be doing that shortly, and I think that will bring another 120 or 130 apartments into the area. 
>> Former wilmington mayor james baker was one of the first to draw attention to the riverfront. In fact, he says baker always said you could find lots of opportunities there. 
>> I think the performance in bringing the riverfront from a dead strickler area that was very unattractive and -- dead strickler -- instrickler area. 
>> Here are plans. 61 new stores or restaurants opened in downtown wilmington in the past few years. The facade improvement program has general you rated $400,000 to improve the appearance of historic buildings. A combined 389 full and part-time small business jobs have been created. The block below market street is leased with residents. Every dollar invested in the main street wilmington program produced a $27 return to the local economy. 

[00:16:47]


>> Coming up on "first," the delaware legislature is back in session. We will lay out what could happen in dover over the next six months. And experiences give new life to old things. Meet the true meaning of trash to treasure in our "first experience." 
>> New year, new rob. If you are like those of us at whyy, this is the week we get paid. If you are paid this week, too, you may be wondering why is my pay different. The man with the answer is rob. New look for you. I like the haircut. 
>> Thank you very much. 
>> Looks good. Let's talk about this new year and why checks look different. We have had all these fiscal cliff negotiations which have been frustrating to watch, but now we are getting punched in the face. Elaborate for us. 
>> Anybody who is just a casual observer has heard the president and congress talk about the need to protect people making under $400,000 a year and protect small businesses. Once you heard the negotiations were over, you thought ok, I am good. But one of these things these guys forgot to do is extend the payroll tax . In their income. That is where it is going. To me it is like the most pernicious thing about it is it affects small businesses twice as much. They claim they are defenders of small businesses, yet the employers are hitting on both sides, on the payroll tax side as well as the employee tax. It is a bunch of nonsense. 
>> Let's talk about the eagles. We have cuts there. Reid is gone, vick's future, i don't know. What do you think? 
>> The big thing is this coaching search. They went off bill o'brien from penn state. He decided to stay after he got a bunch of money. Then they wednesday after chip kelly from oregon. They spent seven hours talking to him. He decided to stay with his college. Maybe they should approach people not from college. Maybe they can get someone to stick to help rebuild the franchise. 

[00:19:07]


>> Is it us? 
>> It seems like philly should be a great place to coach. It may be the personality. 
>> Thanks, rob. If you want to see your comment on rob's work, check out our website for more. 
>> Well, did you miss them? State of play returns on "first." We welcome back stephanie hanson and charlie copeland, president of associates international. Before we getnto wilmington and delaware's future with some new leaders in place, let's take it to barly mill a little bit. Would you like to explain the renewed alliance between dennis and tom when it comes to this project in they both seem to be on the same page? 
>> It is one thing to stand up and say as a policy we want to distance ourselves from what was done in the past, we don't like the way it was done, as opposed to now jumping into a court case at the 11th hour and say we want to change our policy this way, by reinterpreting what the law was back then. I think it's a problem right now. I think there are a better ways to show county/city solidarity. 
>> I can see where dennis williams would want to stop it. Putting a large retail facility, one as large as the mall, right there outside the city of wilmington, could wreak havoc with everything that has been done on the riverfront. They don't have to pay city wage tax out there, free parking. It will be perceived as being city. I was surprised the city didn't come out earlier and say hey, stop this. If you check the donations to various democratic politicians in the state of delaware, one may argue as to why they were not as loud in their opposition. 

[00:21:15]


>> We are talking about a city-county alliance. There is a person head of county council in chris bullock has to be in there. The county defendants -- there is more than one county defendant. It is not like it was filed against the county. It was filed against the county council and the county administration, the land use department and what not. County council is now being headed by chris bullock. And county administration is tom gordon. But there was one lawyer representing both those entities. There was one lawyer representing county council and chris bullock, and one lawyer representing the county add straugs. That one lawyer has been filing briefs on behalf of both of them. We get right to the eve of court where the same lawyer, who now has a discussion with 
-- tom and the lawyer have a discussion, but they don't really go back to reverend bullock or to county council and say oh, by the way we are getting ready to file this that completely undoes all thtuff we said back there. He's got to be feeling really uncomfortable about this. 
>> The whole thing about reducing -- being able to smoke on county -- I think that was probably just a misstep of a new c.A.E. And not quite understanding that it is not as free and easy as it used to be. You are in the public life, and you are subject to a scrutiny that you probably didn't anticipate. 
>> I think there are three issues that they are all going to face, the state, the county and the city. And those are money, money and the third one is money. You look at the city that is running somewhere between $3 million to $5 million operating deficits. They have had a reserve they were able to use from the mid 2000's. They got an increase in taxes from hotels to help fill a hole. I don't see anybody going to dover saying could we raise the taxes on hotels in the city of wilmington? Could we get more out of this fund or whatever to help us solve our budget crisis here in the city of wilmington. Similarly, the county's budget was based largely off of real estate transfer taxes. Despite the fact that the real estate market has stabilized, there is not that transactional volume that you are going to take that 3% off of every time to generate additional revenues. So you are still running $10 million operating deficits, something like that, that they have been using their reserves to fill. The last time tom gordon was executive, he was age to give money away right, left and center because he had so much pouring in. That is different now. Even the state is now saying gee, maybe we can't let the sun set kick in on the increased taxes in delaware.

>> It's a new year and perhaps it's time to clean up the basement as one of your newer's resolutions. 
-- New year's resolutions. What if you could take every day objects and turn them into works of art. 
>> His imagination is worthy of our "first experience." 
>> My name is christopher. I delve into a lots of aspects of media, but currently I have been doing sound object art. I have been doing this for pretty much all maverick life. Have been an artsist and dreamer all my life, and it basically translates into this. Basically anything around you can be used if you can dream it. If I go to a flea market, I am looking around at objects, i don't see the objects anymore. I see what they can be. They are these little narrative vignettes featuring mushroom birds you get at craft scores. I take that quaint cuteness and basically throw that out the window. I have birds basically that are behaving badly. 
>> The zombos are the odd quirky creatures that are a little zombies. They are basically embodyments of every day things and cliche's. 
>> One of my favorite pieces is called brainwashing, and one of these zomuys is behind the counter services brains, and he has washed them. They have nails for hair. I just love those nails. They are antiqueasonry nails, and they rust really well. It is being innovative, almost like mcguiver, you know. I am doing this. This features of the boils on the face are uphole industry tacks. It is seeing the past for what it is, and what it can be. The favorite part is thinking it up. Not the execution. The awe hwa moment any artist 

[00:27:07]


-- ah-ha moment any artist can attest to. The dreaming part is what i like. I basically want to make people laugh. If you want to break it down to its fundamental form, that is the idea. Seeing someone smiling at a piece and pointing to it and getting a reaction is gratifying. 
>> Christopher had his first gallery show in september, and he says he went great. He is looking for other ways to market the zombos. 
>> There are a number of ways to view our stories. The best way is through our website. Your daily delaware news is there as well. Before our "first" shows on demand with comcast. Click local to find the show you want to see.

[00:10:47]


>> Boycott, what boycott? Hundreds of people flocked over voorhees, new jersey, to check out the flyers in their first practice sin the nhl lockout officially ended yesterday. Flyers faithful say they're ready for their boys to get back out on the ice? 
>> I want to see the flyers practice. I never been here before. It's just so cool. 
>> The flyers kick off their season this saturday at home against the penguins. The puck drops at 3:00 p.M. 
>>> We asked on facebook, what are your expectations for this year? It's a short season and tony wrote "i expect a stanley cup since every season the flyers start out great and go downhill after 40 games. And joe said "i expect them to get into the playoffs, win around, get us all flyered up, then lose to a team with a hot goalie. Tough. 
>> Okay. The h3n2, that is the name of the flu strain making life really miserable for so many americans right now.

Plus, mental health care, video games, violent movies, what's the best way to combat the nation's epidemic on violence? All are being considered leading up to what could be historic gun control recommendations next week -- this week I should say in the next couple of days. We'll give you an idea of what to expect coming up. 
>>> And these guys didn't forget their pants, oh, no, they rode a septa subway pant less on purpose. We'll ???????????? 

[00:13:48]


>> armed police officers will soon be patrolling schools in one atlantic county town. Another local school district springs into action following that massacre in newtown, connecticut. Somers point police will be making routine visits to both private and public schools. However, they will not permanently be stationing themselves there. Officials believe having a police presence should keep intruders away from their school 
>>> meanwhile, the gun control battle is sure to heat up in washington. On tuesday, vice-president joe biden is set to present a list of recommendations to president obama on how to curb gun violence in our country. Fox's peter doocy has a look at that. 
>> Reporter: Two days from now, we'll know what that task force vice-president joe biden has been leading will recommend to president obama as a means to reduce gun violence. At this point speculation has been that the administration will seek to restrict assault weapons and high-capacity magazines in some way. 
>> We wish the that instead of talking about guns, specifically, that they question the they would have addressed what do we do to pre 15 these kinds of things in the future? And the evidence shows that an assault weapon ban aren't going to do that. What will do it is doing something about a broken mental health system that allows people who are potentially violent to be on the streets. 
>> Reporter: Cane also said he doesn't think there are enough lawmakers in congress who favor an asslt weapons ban to get one passed, but groups like the center for american progress are questioning how much clout the nra really has. 
>> The nra spent a lot of money on the elections last cycle, and they didn't have a lot to show for it especially if you look at the senate. Nra is a very strong lobby. I think the issue here is, who is going to represent the voices of the american people in this debate? 
>> Reporter: Democratic chris murphy from connecticut thinks the mass murder at sandy hook elementa school in this state last month changed the public about gun control, but the alternate argument was made this morning by former republican governor haley barber from mississippi who said on meet the press he think if's you make eight crime to have a gun, only criminals will have guns.

>> Reporter: Nationally public health officials say some places are experiencing shortages in flu vaccine. Patient much patients are having to wait op shipments to come in but physicians are urging americans to be persistent because vaccine is still available. According to the kent centers for disease control and prevention or cdc, the vaccine is 62% effective in preventing the flu and it takes two weeks to work. So now is the time to get the shot. Nearly 130 million doses of flu vaccine have been distributed and so far at least 112 million have been used. Hospitals around the country have seen spikes in flu r admissions and deaths compared to the last few years. This year's strain the h3n2 is particularly nasty. Making people sicker, longer. Employers are doing whatever they can to keep their work force healthy. Some even handing out masks and encouraging employees to wear them. Physicians caution everyone to wash their hands often, disinfect services, computers and cell phones. The virus is easeily spread on planes and trains and common places like escalators, atm's and even the handle at the gas pump. 
>> All this leads to a higher viral tran mission rate. It's easy enough to get it also from surface that is people have coughed on n have touched after coughing on their hands. So really the best preventative measure at any time is to perform good hand hygiene. 
>> Reporter: The flu is now widespread in 47 states according to the cdc. Mississippi, california and hawaii are the only states not seeing a widespread outbreak.

It was part of the no pants subway ride, and it's exactly what it sounds like. Not wearing any pants.

>> Reporter: Paul put t his live on the line serving when it airborne in iraq. He says he struggled to transition from the battlefield to the workplace. 
>> Ptsd, you know, I think companies are not trained enough to department if I and react to someone that has ptsd. Hire a hero that's a great,, great thing to have. But whenever you hire somebody, know what you're getting into when you hire them. 
>> Reporter: In an ideal world, yes, but some hr insiders admit ptsd scares many companies so they'll actually pass on hiring vets. Some hiring managers perceive vets as two regimenned lacking in creativity and initiative and their skill sets don't match civilian jobs. Hr director willie french admits there are some hiring administrators who do indeed harbor those prejudices. But he says they simply need to get over it. 
>> The evidence is not there that proves otherwise. So I think it would be wise for any organization to put that aside and really focus on the qualifications of the candidate. 
>> Reporter: Nevertheless, the job less rate among vets remains significantly higher than their civilian counterparts. One company that has gotten over it christian brothers automotive the owner says he prefers to hire vets over non-vets but he doesn't ask applicants if they've served.

More than 6,000 people helped the city enter the guiness book of world records for the most -- the biggest snowball fight. Who would think to do that? Organizers trucked in 162,000 pounds of snow from the mountains for that event. 
>> Wow! 
>>> Let's get one of those here. 
>>> Wow! I don't know. Where do we get the snow? 
>> That's a good inter month. There's no snow to be found across our area. 
>>> I heard you say something about a little bit being in the forecast. Is that a mistake? 
>> No. Slipped that in there earlier. Did you catch that. 
>>> Okay. 
>> There is a chance for a little bit of snow. Really haven't seen much across our area especially here in the city but just a little bit doesn't look like a major system as we go through the rest of the week. Joyce, the fog has been the big issue. 
>>> Whitus. 
>> You can barely see out there in your cars. We've got all the fog. There's rain off towards our west. There's ultimate doppler showing a cold front starting to push showers into western pennsylvania. Strong thunderstorms down towards our south. But as this marches northeast ward into our area it's losing a bit of steam. Anything that does move through does look to be pretty light. At this hour it's dry across the delaware valley. But by dry it's just means there's not rain falling from the sky. Still soupy out there with all the fog and the drizzle and mist that accompanies this dense fog. Let's move to the maps. We've got the fog all night, and as a result temperatures are actually rising. We just hit our high temperature for the day of 50 degrees. We could have done a lot better than that earlier this afternoon but unfortunately when you have the clouds and the fog that prevents the temperatures from rising. Our normal 40. The record 70 set back in the 1930s. 50 in philadelphia. 48 wilmington. 46 pottstown and 51 in millville on a down rightm night for january. You don't even really need the heat this evening. Visibilities very low across the area. That's a result of that fog and in factor in for the drive tomorrow morning it's going to be the same scenario us a head back to work and school extra time needed especially in all the major roads. You know it's going to be slow going tomorrow. Fox future cast showing some of those showers overnight tonight but anything that moves through fades away by the time we hit the drive. Most of monday is dry. Thely fog should lift in the afternoon. That cold front that passes us by looks to stall out towards our south. Showers may regenerate monday night along the front. Mainly rain at this point but a little bit of frozen precipitation could mick in. Better chance for that frozen stuff late tuesday. Here's the next wave that will form along that frontal boundary the white showing some snow. The pink could be sleet mixing in between those rain and snow. This is tuesday afternoon. Right now the models kind of diverging on the timing but basically when you have these fronts stalled to your south the timing up for grabs. Plenty of moisture to pla with as we head into tuesday evening. So that mix looks to be right along 95 it's not a big northwest ward where it tip plea lays out. More warm area overnight into wednesday. We transition to just some rain. Kind of an interesting scenario over the next couple of days. That front will sit over us and will spark showers. We've got the clouds and fog. It will linger the next couple of days. Final until front exits. In its wake we dry out but much colder air coming through the cold air back in the northern plane. By the time it reaches us it won't be the single digits but back to some more seasonable readings. This is thursday. Through the weekend so next weekend very different. Much more typical january weather for us. For tonight temperatures on the rise with the fog and the drizzle. 55 tomorrow. Morning fog very dense. Just clouds and maybe a shower around in the afternoon. Seven day forecast a mix is possible with a little bit of snow, a little bit of sleet moving in that could mix with the rain at times both monday night and tuesday night. Then we clear out by thursday. We see the sunshine again which will be a welcomed change i think. We've been in this gloomy pattern all week epp. We will be about early wednesday drying but turning colder. Nice brisk weather looks kind of

>> Tucker: Who is really influencing the white house when it comes to gun control legislation. Here is a hint, it's not the n.R.A., But it might be a liberal think tank. More on that coming up. 
>> An exciting night at the miss america pageant. There she is. 
>> Your new miss america is... Miss new york. 
>> How about that, 23-year-old mallory, why are they always surprised? It's a 50/50 chance. "Fox & friends" sunday morning the first hour starts right now. ???????????? 
>> good morning, everybody, thanks so much for joining us, great to be here with tucker carlson, mike jerrick. 
>> Tucker: Hi, ali. 
>> Good morning. 
>> Tucker: Why is the look always. 
>> Alisyn: Wha the miss america, it's patented. 
>> Alisyn: Is it always the person on the right side who wins? The stage manager is in charge, I think. 
>> Alisyn: And we'll give you more on that, but first the headlines and tell you exactly what's happening at this hour, overnight egyptian president mubarak getting a second chaps chance the at freedom. A court has given up the-- the no date has been set for the retrial. The government wants to help people get vaccinated, temporarily banning pharmacies from vaccinating people under the age 18. And now they'll give shots to kids six months and older. But with the levels and vaccination shortage nationwide. Some are waiting in long lines like you're seeing to get the shots. Italian coast guard releasing brand new rescue video from the night of the costa concordia disaster. One year ago that the cruise ship sank. Look at the video, after crashing into a bed of rocks over the coast in italy you see passengers in life jackets climbing down the ladder to rescue boats and today, this is the scene here, coming up at 6:20 eastern, two survivors who will join us live and share with us their firsthand account of that terrifying ordeal. 

[00:03:05]


>> This was stunning, I bet you watched the first game. Any football fan who watched the ravens game. 
>> Clayton:. 
>> Under a minute. Flacco, somehow got behind the defense in overtime, peyton manning forces this pass and intercepted, and six plays later, and now, in double overtime the ravens kick a game winning 47 yard field goal to stun the broncos, 38-35. And then from san francisco, 49ers qb kaepernick, rushing, 181 yards and two touchdowns, and had the the game of his lifetime. Those are your headlines. 
>> Thank you very much. I would have had to have read that phonetically. 
>> Kaernick? 
>> Yes, let's check with rick reichmuth. 
>> Rick: The dangers of early morning tv, I fell asleep right at double overtime, i have no how it happened, but i woke up when the game was done, I was bummed. Warm across the southeast, enjoy it, this is all about to change and once it goes away, it's gone for a long time. The cold air across the west will replace it and the warm air up to the west and that's going to be a bit of a change that's going to be happening, another very cold morning out to the west and factor in the wind and it's brutal out there. Minus 17, and minus 24 in glasgow and a lot of cold air still there, but it's a slow mover. Anything to the east of this is where it's warmer, and to the west it's cold and not really precipitation on either side of that. But this rain here and sometimes will be heavy again today, causing a little bit of flash flooding and see the cold air behind it, snow and flurries, some of it headed to the kansas city area and the northern plains and northern great lakes, not the northern plains, but the rain showers may be crossing over into a little bit of snow across lower michigan later on today. The high temperatures not warm at all. Well below freezing and only 48 today in the phoenix area. Tomorrow remaining cold, a number of cold days across the west and slow moving front moves up to the east. All right, guys. 

[00:05:33]


>> Alisyn: Thanks, rick. 
>> Tucker: Who is influencing the gun control in washington? The n.R.A., Whether you degree with them or not, one of the largest grass roots, many of them democrat and bipartisan organization, and pennsylvania has more n.R.A. Members than the united states. The white house apparently taking cues from the center of american progress by the former chief of staff of bill clinton and they have a 13-point list of gun control proposals that they thought through many years ago they're handing to the white house and apparently, according to the post, the white house likely to act on a lot of these. 
>> We can't get through all 14, universal background check, making military grade assault weapons, ban those, high capacity magazines we do that, and modernize data systems, track gun sales and enforcing existing laws, pretty standard enough, but a list of 13. 
>> Alisyn: Yeah, one of the things they are suggesting which will probably anger many people listening, if the president can't get widespread support for some of these proposals, that he act on executive order, in other words, unilaterally, and that would be unfortunate. Who knows what the vice-president is going to propose on tuesday when he comes out with proposals, if it turned out that the president were just to steam roll over people and act unilaterally, that, that feels wrong, because if there was ever a time nationally that people are open and receptive to making some sort of fundamental change for the safety of kids, so that newtown never happens again, it's right now. 
>> Wouldn't that be a time to invoke executive action if you're ever going to do it it, maybe now would be the time. 
>> Alisyn: Ion't think you need to. 
>> Tucker: What you don't want if you're the president is to have a national debate on the subject because there's no evidence, never been any evidence, I mean data evidence, social science that shows at that guns control reduces crime. If you would get it through congress you would have adults talking about it in public and that's messy and unfortunate and difficult. 

[00:07:46]


>> What we want. 
>> Tucker: It's easier to force through on executive order. 
>> Alisyn: We shall see if that's what their plan is and we'll talk more about what the center for american progress proposed. You know the story of the journal ne, at that published the names and addresses legal gun owners our own judge jeanine pirro was on that list, last night on her show, she just-- well, first what she did was send one of other producers to the journal news to try to get answers for why they did this. Let's see what happened when the producer showed up. 
>> Why won't you talk to us? Can you tell me why you guys released the names of the gun owners? 
>> I'm sorry I'm on the phone. 
>> Janet-- as you can see, we have door slammed right in our face. 
>> So not terribly receptive to having a conversation and to explaining what their rational was. 
>> Tucker: We already know the rational and judge pirro i thought put it pretty eloquently on her show, the rational was to make a political statement, basically editorial about guns and tie legal gun owners to whack-jobs which kill children which she pointed out specious, outrageous comparison. 
>> If you didn't hear it why don't we play a piece of it right now. 
>> You think it's important to out us in the aftermath of the newtown shooting? How dare you connect law abiding citizens who have gone through rigorous background checks, fingerprinted, investigated and received judicial approval to exercise their second rights. How dare you compare them to a nut-job on the lunatic fringe in desperate need of medication, playing violent video games for days at a time. This animal massacred innocent babies, he didn't have a pistol permit. He didn't go through a rigorous background check to get a pistol permit. He took someone else's gun and good night way, although it's none of your business, the's a reason people have guns. We don't need your sanctimonious permission. And you dare put our families in danger? You pry into our lives? You put our privacy and security and our safety in jeopardy and then you have nothing to say? How about I say it for you. You're nothing, but a bunch of cowards, unwilling to defend yourselves, frozen in fear, you screwed up period. End of story. 

[00:10:22]


>> Alisyn: There you go. A very compelling argument and she was obviously framing it TO terry McBride the journal news editor and the owner, this one janet-- I'm sorry, president and publisher the people as we understand who decided to put the james and addresses out there and won't engage in conversation with judge jeanine or anyone else about their decision. So the judge took to her show and she talked about at least her reason for having it, she was a judge and yes, she put people behind bars and they will get out and could be seekingome sort of retribution. 
>> And you gave a road map to criminals, okay, they have a gun, they have a gun, they don't we'll rob their house, but it's none of their business in the first place. 
>> Tucker: One of the great divides in this country is those in power, office holders who have body guards and the rest of us rely on 911 when something bad happens. I had a great e-mail from one of the viewers, maybe the people passing the law ought to rely on 911 for their safety and for their families, too, and see how they like it, not a bad idea. 
>> Alisyn: The level playing field, even the celebrities in hollywood whagainst gun laws. 
>> They have protection. 
>> Alisyn: And everybody rails against it, nobody can it guns except our body guards, they're equipped because they're trustworthy. 
>> Tucker: If you're delivering milk to a bodega at three in the morning in a crumby neighborhood and a lot of people in new york city are, facing a real risk of armed robbery and putting your life on the line every not allowed to have a gun. And if you're in some stupid sit com, and you are. 
>> Or a woman's magazine is claiming it's going to power women. Why is the editor mocking women who choose to have a gun. 

[00:12:31]


>> Tucker: Looks like x-factor didn't work out, but vegas may be ahead. And peeve the details, they're juicy of course. ???????????? ???????????? drown it out. Introducing e all-new 2013 lexus ls f sport. An entirely new pursuit. 

[00:14:55]


>> The independent women's harsh criticism over its views op gun rights for women. 
>> Tucker: And that criticism came from one of the largest women's magazines in this country, clamor. And here is more is fox news contributor. What did glamour say about the iwf decision on guns? 
>> Limiting magazines-- ammunition magazine for women at home with their children, and without their husband. The georgia case had five rounds in the handgun and shot the intruder and didn't walk away dead, he walked away alive. And glamour got this statement and responded saying it was strange, and that it was only intended to cause problems and antagonize the debate rather than add to it. 
>> Alisyn: In fact, sorry to interrupt you, I want to show you exactly what glamour's deputy editor responded. Here it is. Please unsubscribe me to your strange sensationlizing polemics. Some people feel they need a gun for protection and empowerment. 
>> Here name is lauren lanotti, the deputy editor at glamour, said not only strange, but used for maximum agitation, considering that glamour magazine dives into political all the time, seems they would want the debate. More women than ever are interested in having concealed carry permits defending themselves in their homes and the iwf statement came from someone who is at home a lot, her husband is overseas fighting for my freedom and theirs, she feels she needs more than five bullets in her handgun to defend herself and two young children. This is something that glamour magazine didn't seem to be interested in, if they run crime stories in their magazine all the time. It seems like they'd be interested in at least the side of the story where women are willing to defend themselves in their homes with a firearm. 

[00:17:08]


>> It's hard to see what the argument is against women arming themselves. They basically commit zero crimes against strangers and aren't prone to shopping up shopping mall. It seems a way to empower and equallize the situation. Why would you not be for that? 
>> Well, and that's the question about glamour magazine, is whether you want to believe it or not. Women are not as strong as men and guns serve as a great equalizing, when it comes to home invasions. Women who stay at home often have very young children and it's difficult to make sure they're in a safe place while you're defending them and yourself against an intruder and the firearm is the easiest way to make sure there's no harm done to yourself and your children. 
>> I met a woman two years ago at the national rifle association, and anti-gun until a man broke into her son's bedroom at night and the only thing she had to fight back as a bottle of kitchen spray and a knife and she now understands the importance of defending yourself and your children inside your home. And glamour magazine didn't look at it as a home defense rather than-- 
>> and glamour lip gloss and tips for looking sexy, but they do look at other political issues. Thank you for looking at that for us this morning. 
>> Thank you. 
>> Tucker: A year ago today, the costa concordia crashed and sank off the coast of italy. And up next, two survivors join us. 
>> Alisyn: A new miss america crowned last night and we'll show you more of the crowning moment. ???????????? ???????????? ???????????? Using cloud computing and mobile technology, Verizon innovators have developed a projective display for firefighters. Allowing them to see through anything. Because the world's biggest challenges deserve even bigger solutions. Powerful answers. Verizon.

>> Quick headlines for you, a bird strike forced a jet blue plane to turn around after it took off from new york's jfk airport. The plane headed to the dominican republic was hit by a bird on the nose of the plane. It was inspected and took off two hours later. And the trial of mohammed mahmoud, accused of planning to bomb the tree lighting ceremony. Prosecutors say he was a radical determined to pull off that plot. 
>> Mike: The one year anniversary of the tragic costa concordia ship wreck off the island in giglio in italy. A day that will forever leave a mark on those who lost loved ones and others that were there hours on end. Joining us for a firsthand account, and recorded the disaster themselves. And welcome to "fox & friends." Let's go back a year ago. Why were you on the ship in the first place. What were you celebrating. 

[00:23:35]


>> This was our honeymoon, actually. 
>> Mike: Where were you when it rolled over on its side, the ship. 
>> We were in our cabin looking through some of our photos from a day spent in rome and we heard kind of a soft, dull sound coming from behind us. And then the whole room started leaning over to the side. Wine glass, wine bottles fell off the table, the tv started sliding out of the cabinet. 
>> Mike: Emily, what did you think was happening. 
>> I thought. I asked benji, maybe a really big wave. He said I don't think so. 
>> Mike: Did you think of the "titanic" instantly. 
>> We thought of the "titanic" as we were trying to escape from the ship. We thought about jumping into the water and how that would give us risk of hypothermia and we thought about if the ship continuing sinking, then we might get pulled under by the suction of the sinking, so, ironically, we were thinking about the "titanic" the whole time. 
>> Mike: Of course. Now, you're scrambling around and we've seen the video of people banging into each other. Did you ever make it to a life boat? 
>> We made it to a life boat and as our life boat was being lowered down to the water, it kept banging into the ship because the ship was leaning over so severely, our life boat couldn't go down and hauled it up and we got back out on to the ship. So, 23 of the 26 life boats deployed, but there were three life boats that didn't so between three and 500 people were left behind, and we were included in that. 
>> Mike: Well, emily, of course, you're here a year later. How did you eventually get off of the ship? 
>> We eventually got off the ship by tieing knots on ropes and rappelled down the side of the cruiseliner. 
>> Mike: What in the world-- well, now you've documented this in abandon ship, this book and emily you put a cd together. Emily, how are you feeling on the anniversary? 

[00:25:44]


>> It has been a really intense and emotional year. Benji and I got ptsd therapy for months and try to rebuild our lives and see if maybe t tragedy was a way for us to make meaning and make changes in our lives. So, it's been really emotional because we just finished our project and now sharing it with the world, saying to the world, sometimes terrible things happen to good people and we can make meaning out of it. 
>> Yeah. One of the things I was trying to do with this book is i wanted to tell the story of our escape from the ship, climbing down this rope and getting trapped in a stairwell and just the horror of knowing that water was rushing into the ship. But I also wanted to tell the story of us trying to get help from the american embassy and getting basically no help from them at all and story of us getting back home. 
>> Mike: Well, are you closer now? 
>> Yeah, I actually have a wonderful story to tell. When we were -- when we went up to the fourth deck waiting for life boats and everyone was pushing and frightened. We were at the back of the line and I looked at everyone pushing and I looked at benji and said, hey, I don't want to push, is that okay with you? He said, yeah, it's okay with me, I said okay, that means we might not get on the life boat, and then we'll die and then he said, okay, that's okay with me. And this is when I knew, i married my soulmate and through this year, really, it's reconfirmed our love and commitment for each other. 
>> Mike: My goodness. 
>> We've never been closer. After having gone through an experience like this and coming home and working on the process of creating something from it, trying to make something meaningful and something hopefully beautiful and sharing that with the world, and we've been united in this since. 

[00:27:51]


>> Mike: And the book, the book and the cd are beautiful. You've accomplished that. Real quickly, benji, what do you think of the captain? He took a lot of heat afterwards, rightfully so? 
>> Our opinion of the captain is probably a little surprising. We think he's a fool who made a mistake and put a lot of lives at risk and ultimately 32 people lostheir lives on his mistake. 
>> Mike: Kind of showing off. But it was a mistake and we think that the responsibility flows upward into the cruise company and we think the captain at this point his life is basically ruined and never set foot on a ship again. 
>> Mike: It is. 
>> We'd like to see the responsibility taken up the chain and you know, there are seven people at costa cises who are also under investigation. 
>> Mike: Speaking of being on ship again, and setting foot. Were you ever go on a cruise again? 
>> That's tough to say. I don't know that we would necessarily rule that out, but one of the things that we gained from our ptsd therapy we're not going to rule out it go something like that. 
>> Mike: You're a great couple and cute together. Awe thr getting up early. 
>> Thank you for having us. 
>> Mike: Check out the book and cd. Have you ever heard of this one, a teacher with a fear of children? We'll he tell you now why she's suing her school district for discrimination.

I've been fortunate to win on golf's biggest stages. But when joint pain and stiffness from psoriatic arthritis hit, even the smallest things became difficult. I finally understood what serious joint pain is like. I talked to my rheumatologist and he prescribed enbrel. Enbrel can help relieve pain, stiffness, and stop joint damage. Enbrel may lower your ability to fight infections. Serious, sometimes fatal events including infections, tuberculosis, lymphoma, other cancers, nervous system and blood disorders, and allergic reactions have occurred. Before starting enbrel, your doctor should test you for tuberculosis and discuss whether you've been to a region where certain fungal infections are common. You should not start enbrel if you have an infection like the flu tell your doctor if you're prone to infections, haveuts or sores, have had hepatitis b, have been treated for heart failure, or if you have symptoms such as persistent fever, bruising, bleeding, or paleness.

>> Do a lot of movement and activity and iave some moves here that we can work on together. 
>> I've seen the dvd. Could we start with the pelvis circles. 
>> I heard you were watching it all night and you were going to teach us everything this morning. 

[00:34:42]


>> Mike: I have it on a loop. 
>> The pelvic circles like a hulahoop, basically, are you ready. 
>> We're ready, start moving forward with the hips, just going in slow motion, and we're opening-- and everybody at home. Get up off the couch and do this, mike, you are so good at this and the other way. 
>> Mike: Oh, the other way.

>> Rick, what do you have for weather outside? 
>> You know, I've got a little inspired by mike. Didn't work, didn't work, i still feel flabby, I don't like it. Right now as you're waking up, this is the rain and snow the last 24 hours, falling in the same spot for the most part. In addition to 12 inches of rain, across louisiana last week, big flooding concerns, take a look where the watches and warnings are, we've got 134 states that have flood concerns and hit that map one more time. You can sigh the map across the areas of the south and the areas that have flash flood watches or warnings going on right now in the purple and goes all the way in towards the great lakes as well. Anywhere to the east then, we've got fog today and that's what we're going to see in your forecast, the low cloudy sky kind of like yesterday. Temps held a little cooler than I think we thought we were going to get to because the cloud cover stayed thicker than we thought it would be as well and not bad at all. Down to the southeast, temps are looking quite warm.

>> Yes, yes.

>> Alisyn: We'll keep you posted. Let's say you had a fear, a phobia of sitting on this filthy couch. You couldn't do your job. Could you sue fox for having this filthy couch here? 
>> That's happening to one teacher in marmount? What state. 
>> I think in ohio. 

[00:41:20]


>> Alisyn: A teacher is suing her school district because she says she has a phobia of children and says she cannot work with kids anymore and nothing do with fact that the school is eliminating french and she's the french teacher. She has a phobia of children, and makes it difficult for her to be a school teacher. 
>> Tucker: Do you have a right to the precise job you want? Does your employer have an obligation, a legal obligation to give you exactly what you want? And to meet every one of your self-described needs and if he doesn't, can you sue them? Most people would say no. 
>> Mike: The reason it's a story, it's so absurd. 
>> Tucker: Thank you for the clarity on that issue. 
>> Alisyn: Thank you, mike. Let me just say that not a made up disorder. Apparently, it is rare, but real. In is an actual phobia, it's called pediphobia. 
>> Mike: You should find another line of work. 
>> Tucker: I would say that's true. A couch analsy, if we have couch phobia this would not be a suitable gig. 
>> Alisyn: I would have to suppress the couch phobia because the couch can cause fear. 
>> Tucker: I medicate for it. 
>> Alisyn: But, anyway, let's let you know what you think of the teacher if she had a case, and if she had this real phobia of children. 
>> Tucker: And she's got a solid point and that will happen. 
>> Mike: Oh, yeah. 
>> Tucker: The new york governor declaring a health emergency as the flu reaches epidemic proportions. 
>> Mike: And one of hollywood's hottest ladies officially off the market this morning.

And sorry, guys, actress olivia wilde is officially off the market and 28-year-old is engaged to "saturday night live" funny maseidkis. 
>> Tucker: And one day after federal officials declared the virus had reached epidemic proportions in the country and why is it important to go to the hospital and how can the flu shot help you. Joining us now is the emergency department, doctor, thank you for joining us. 
>> Thank you. 
>> Tucker: What's the distinction between an emergency and a nonemergency? 
>> Well, really most people with normal immune systems can stay home with flu or flu-like illness. The ones that need to worry who have asthma, emphysema, diabetes, diseases that decreased immune system or higher risk. What do they look for, a fever that doesn't respond to tylenol or motrin or shortness of breath or pre longed illness and tried the treatment at home, two, three, four days, or symptoms getting worse or dehydration, those persons should come to the emergency room. New york declared this an emergency, what does that mean? 
>> One of the important things to look at with this emergency, the good thing, the govedecided to allow pharmacists to give the flu vaccine to six months or older. In the past you had to be over 18 before you got the flu vaccines. 

[00:48:19]


>> Tucker: Why. 
>> And the good thing now is we have a larger cadre of health professionals who can give the vaccine. It's never too late to get the vaccine. It peaks in january and february and tails into march and april even further. So right now if you don't have the vaccine, definitely get out there and get it. Takes about two weeks for immunity to build up full potency, definitely a good tool to use in battling the flu. 
>> Tucker: Would you recommend your patience to stay out of certain areas, subway, airlines. 
>> With a high concentration of people. One sneeze, one cough, on the hands, spread to a doorknob, things like that. Limit your exposure out in the public definitely and that's why I think this flu epidemic hit so hard, it started right before the holidays when people were travelling on congregating at parties and gatherings. 
>> Tucker: What can you do to boost your immune system. 
>> A lot of things to do, number one, you need to rest, eat nutritious foods, exercise, wash your hands frequently, and that's both when you use public transportation, out in public or with a gathering of people and you need to definitely inhe crease your intake of fruits and vegetables, exercise is always an immunity booster and things that we forget around the holiday period because we're so stressed and need adequate rest. Turn off the computer and smart phones when you go to bed and actually sleep. 
>> That's good advice in any season. 
>> Thank you very much.

>> Okay. You've been waiting. You think now is the time to buy a house, but there are new mortgage rules that go in effect in a few days, got to be careful. 
>> Alisyn: What are the new rules? And will they help the consumer or will they help the bank? Joining us now is real estate expert, morgan brennan. 
>> Hi, thanks for having me. 
>> Alisyn: As we understand it, the new rules are designed to keep people from borrowing more than they can pay back. That's a novel approach. 
>> It sounds very obvious, but until this week, we haven't seen this regulation on the book. Basically the take away here, this is the first rule from dodd frank and first rule in several that we're going to see from the consumer bureau that's stining the mortgage process. Not changing lending scenario, we've seen, post economic down turn, but to prevent another housing bubble and subprime mortgages. 
>> That's how we got into trouble, you've got to be able to repay it. What's the debt to burden ratio have to be now? 
>> The debt to burden tio 4you can't have more than 43% debt. 
>> I have to prove that. >>Criteria, credit history, assets and things automatically applying. 
>> No more high fees, that sounds good. How does that work? 
>> It's great, cap off at 3%. You the borrower to get that mortgage won't be paying more than 3% of the loan. 
>> Mike: And no more teaser rates. How are we being teased? 
>> We saw with the subprime mortgage crisis and all of the lax lending that led town t, exotic loans and toxic assets. And misleadingly low teaser rates and people qualify for that interest rate and take out loans that maybe eventually couldn't afford. No more of that. 

[00:55:46]


>> Alisyn: No more exotic loans, that's intriguing, what's exotic loans? 
>> Interest only mortgages or loans with balloon payments, that exceed 30 years in duration of the loans. Not going to see more of these. Basically, the take away here is qualified mortgage. That's a term you're going to hear a lot more of and now the industry standard. 
>> Mike: What do you think of the new regulations? Is it better for us or the bank? 
>> I think that remains to be seen. I think this is in general, i think this is pretty good on the heels of two other mortgage related settlements with private lenders this week and ang all of this will provide more confidence in the marketplace for some lenders to stop looking back at the last six years and start lending to qualified. 
>> What are the rates. 30-year fixed below 4%. I think it will stay there for the year. 
>> Alisyn: Morgan, thank you. 
>> Thank you. 
>> Alisyn: What is up next for president obama? Is it immigration reform? You better watch out. It looks like one republican already has some of his ideas in the works. We're live from washington with details of this.

>> good morning, everyone, it's sunday, january 13th, I'm alisyn camerota. The gun debate rages on, not the n.R.A., But it could be a liberal think tank. 
>> Tucker: The white house isn't just focusing on gun control, coming up on the president's to-do list, I am nation reform. Does it mean amnesty for illegals? We'll break down his plan. 
>> Mike: There she is, a new miss america named just last night. 
>> Your new miss america is... Miss new york.

>> you're right. The other woman has to slink off in shame. 
>> Tucker: The director mercifully excludes her from the shot. 
>> Mike: You don't matter anymore. 
>> Tucker: Practice. It's so good. You watch the pageants,on't you. 
>> Mike: Yes, I do, actually. Miss montana has autism. 
>> Alisyn: Is that right. 
>> Mike: Miss d.C., A double mastectomy. 
>> Alisyn: We interviewed her her. 
>> Mike: And miss puerto rico was on crutches. 
>> Alisyn: I didn't know you stayed up and watch. 
>> Tucker: I was watching football. 
>> Alisyn: And meanwhile, let's talk about the top story of the weekend and that's what's going to happen this week when vice-president biden unveils what he says are his proposals that he's come up with over the past weeks in terms of what to do about guns violence. There's an interesting story in the washingtons post, who is influences and who best has the white house's ear. 

[01:01:49]


>> Mike: And talking with the n.R.A. And the video game manufacturers and people in the mental health industry. 
>> Alisyn: Good. 
>> Mike: Is it being influenced by a liberal think tank? 
>> My impression was the white house was talking at the n.R.A. For a photo op, but not for the first time the group for center of american progress, not unlike a grass roots, n.R.A., But a think tank in washington run by democratic staffers and "the washington post" piece suggests there are 13 gun control proposals, and they've put over to the white house and some may be acted on by executive order not by congress. 
>> Mike: Things like background checks, making military grade assault weapons, we'll ban those, high capacity magazines talk about that all the time and ban those. Modernizing the data base. Enforcing the laws on the books that are tougher. 
>> Alisyn: The devil is in the details. I don't know what military grade weapons are. 
>> Tucker: They're not actually, you need a federal firearms weapons. 
>> Alisyn: Is that what they're talking about. 
>> Tucker: No. 
>> Alisyn: Or the semi automatics. 
>> Tucker: Semi automatic, probably majority of weapons, any gun that fires when you pull the trigger. 
>> Alisyn: Right. 
>> Tucker: Assault weapons are those that look scary to people who know nothing about guns. 
>> Alisyn: And somebody described it as the difference, between is black and one is brown. 
>> Tucker: Barrel shrouds, signed to keep you from burning your fingers when the barrel is hot. And those were illegal under the last ban because they're dangerous. And on the basis of facts they don't know anything about is terrifying, ignorance is scary. 
>> Mike: And it would be a great conversation to have in congress that we all to watch and learn. 
>> Tucker: Exactly, you debate it and maybe you'll agree with one side or the other, but you get to hear a vigorous exchange of ideas and evidence and counter evidence, but executive orders don't allow that and the president acting like the king and the knight, must obey. 

[01:04:06]


>> Alisyn: And we'll learn what the task force came up with. They're interested in putting out information, the journal news, outside of new york city, published that list of an interactive map of legal gun permit holders names and addresses. Our own judge jeanine pirro was one of the people on that list and people can now find her sadly online and her address. So, she wanted to get answers from the editor and the publisher of the journal news and sent her own producer there, to try to ask some questions. Here is what happened. 
>> Why don't you talk to us? Can you tell me why you guys released the names of the gun owners? 
>> I'm sorry, I'm on the phone. 
>> Hi, janet. As you can see, we had door slammed right in our face. 
>> So they wouldn't talk, but jeanine did talk to talk to them. If they wouldn't come on the show she said I will tell you what I believe and what i think abouthis whole situation with publishing the names and addresses of gun owners in those three counties, here is what jeanine had to say last night. 
>> Tucker: Boy, did she. 
>> You think it's important to out us in the aftermath of the newtown shooting? How dare you connect law abiding citizens who have gone through rigorous background checks, who have been fingerprinted, investigated and received judicial approval to exercise their second amendment rights. How dare you compare them to a none-job on the lunatic fringe, in desperate need of medication, playing violent video games for days at a time. This animal massacred innocent babies. He didn't have a pistol permit. He didn't go through a rigorous background check to get a pistol permit. He took someone else's gun and by the way, although it's none of your business, there's a reason people have guns. We don't need your sanctimonious permission. And you dare put our families in danger, you pry into our lives and you put our private ap security and our safety in jeopardy and then you have nothing to say? How about I say it for you, you're nothing, but a bunch of cowards, unwilling to defend yourselves. Frozen in fear. You screwed up period, end of story. . 

[01:06:31]


>> Tucker: Here is my question, is folk hero one word or two words or does it matter? Jeanine pirro qualifies, I'm going to watch that. Instead of for a run I'm going to watch that clip. I'm more energized watching that than hitting the treadmill. 
>> Alisyn: If you want to read more, go to foxnews.Com and she wrote an article the different types of people who would want to have a gun in their home, including, judge jeanine who had indicted and prosecuted criminals who of course could seek retaliation. 
>> Tucker: And this is not something that the members of congress have to worry about, they have body guards with high capacity magazines and assault rifles. And in other words, they think they need these firearms to protect themselves and their families and you don't think you should be allowed to take them to defend yours. 
>> Mike: And let's talk about another hot button issue. President obama setting his sights on perhaps the next overhaul of the immigration system. And there is already a republican challenge in the works. 
>> Jennifer griffin joins us live with the details. 
>> Good morning, guys. The president has vowed to take on immigration reform. But florida senator marco rubio whose parents were from cuba, accuses the president of poisoning the well, even last minute laws through an executive order issuing work permits and halting deportation just prior to the election. In a wide ranging interview in the wall street journal, rubio explains why the president must embrace immigration reform and outlines what he hopes to be his signature plan. Quote, I don't think there's a lot of concern in this country that we'll now get overrun by ph.D.'S and entrepreneurs. I think it's the rhetoric by a handful of voices in the minority, but loud none the less that have allowed the left to create an unfair perception to conservatives and republicans are anti-hispanic, and anti-immigration, and we do have to overcome that. There are nearly 12 million illegal workers right now in the country, but only 6.5% of those who came here, came here based on unique education or skills. The u.S. Could not harvest its fruit crops without the large number of migrant workers who are mostly hispanic and senator rubio wants, quote, guest worker visas for unskilled labor and stands behind employers doing background checks on workers and tough border policies. Rubio wants to make it easier for those with skills, engineers and tech savvy immigrants, the president wants a pathway for citizenship here and vowed to help the children of illegal immigrants who are already here. 

[01:09:27]


>> These are young people studying in our schools, they play in our neighborhoods, they're friends with our kids, they pledge allegiance to our flag. They are americans in their hearts, in their minds, in every single way, but one, on paper. 
>> If the president wants to overhaul immigration, he'll need to convince big labor to get on board. Senator marco rubio sees it as a gateway and could lead to republican party if successful. Back to you in narc. 
>> Alisyn: What's happening overnight. Ousted president mubarak granted appeal of his life sentence by egyptian court. New video into the news room of supporters celebrating that ruling. Mubarak was convicted of prevent killing of hundreds of protesters and toppled his regime nearly two years ago, no date set for the 84 year olds's retrial. Good news for many new yorkers wanting to vaccine their children. Governor cuomo granted a flu imagine, temporarily suspends the laws for pharmacies vaccinating kids under the age of 18. Many looking to get the vaccine met with long lines like these, and scramble to get the shots and a shortage applied nationwide. And a soldier reunited with his family at the ice ri 
>> what are you doing? 
(Cheers) 
>> that's captain nathan, he shocks his wife and three kids at a hockey game in minnesota. There he is taking off the goalie mask, they were not expecting him home until next week and he spent the last eight months in afghanistan working as a critical care nurse with the air national guard. Those are the best stories!. 
>> Mike: I know it. It gets me every single time. 

[01:11:28]


>> Alisyn: They're great. 
>> Mike: They thought he was the goalie. Oh, look, dad. 
>> Alisyn: I know. 
>> Mike: That's great. Today is going to be what, 55, 60 degrees in new york city. 
>> Alisyn: That's what they say. That's the hype. 
>> Mike:. 
>> Rick: Enjoy it, it's over. And tucker, what you need to learn about alisyn, how many she loves winter and really cold temperatures. 
>> Alisyn: I was born on the first day of summer and I love summer so I complain from labor day to memorial day. 
>> Tucker: Good for you, I'm on your side. 
>> Rick: You're both going to be complaining a lot in a bit. He enjoy today. If you're east of this line of storms, looking good. Fog gep and the fog a big problem we'll have, I'll show you where,ut heavy rain as well because we have the flooding concerns across parts of the lower mississippi valley and headed to the mid ohio valley as well. And then ahead of this, it's a very foggy morning, kind of like what you saw yesterday and kind after repeat of that today. 16 states that have dense fog advisories in effect as you head out on the roads this morning, plenty of time and distance between the cars in front of you. Anywhere to the best of that storm, it's incredibly cold. 48 in phoenix, and 49 in l.A. 52 in palm springs, below freezing in palm springs and phoenix, almost unheard of. Fine must six in flagstaff and incredible cold temperatures there. The real cold that you really, really dislike, that massive air right there. Where you see that peak, that's the coldest air and right now we have cold air, winter air across the northern plains and across the west, it's warm to the east. We're starting to see the pattern change and in the middle of the week, that flattens out. Tha batch of cold air cold to the parts of the northeast by thursday and later next weekend and next week, we're going to see that get down to our area and could be dealing with temperatures in the single digits. Get ready. Single digits. 
>> Alisyn: Me no liky. 
>> Rick: You wouldn't. 
>> Alisyn: Next week when you're on tucker, I'll be wearing a parka. 
>> Tucker: That might be kind of cool. 
>> Alisyn: Look forward to that. 

[01:13:30]


>> Mike: Attractive still. 
>> Alisyn: Wow. 
>> Mike: In the wake of the newtown shooting in connecticut schools across the country are having a zero tolerance policy, in one case suspending a six-year-old pointing a finger like a gun at a student. Is it that or child's play? 
>> And thousands show up for the world's largest snowball fight. Amazing. ???????????? who emailed it to emily, who sent it to cindy, who wondered why her soup wasn't quite the same. The recipe's not the recipe... Ohhh.

[ Female Announcer ] THE SECRET IS SWANSON. help balance? Try the #1 gastroenterologist recommended probiotic. Align. Align naturally helps maintain digestive balance. ?????? Ooh, baby, can I do for you today? ?????? try align today. 

[01:16:15]


>> The wake of the newtown shootings, preventive measures are amped up across the conduct and is it possible we're taking some things anyway, too far? A recent study of the school suspensions in the d.C. Area, for example, from last year, noticed they were more than 6,000 suspensions of kids from pre-kindergarten to fifth grade, including 50 pre-kin. 433 in kindergarten, suspension. 677 in first grade, 813 in the second grade and by third grade, 1,086. And with us the former labor secretary nominee and fox news contributor. Thanks for coming. Great to be with you. 
>> Tucker: This steams a little over the top. What could you possibly do in pre-kindergarten to earn a suspension. 
>> One of the kids what he did was go pow and got him kicked out of school and had to stay home and his parents are objecting now, and I don't know, may end up bringing a lawsuit. It really is ridiculous and part of thproblem is, we've sort of femiized school. Little boys, outside of the realm of what a lot of schools want to see and frankly it's a problem. What you're doing is teaching the wrong lesson, teaching that child's play is somehow aggressive, violent, and that in some way diminishes real violence when you have a kid who really is aggressive, if you could be suspended for simply playing, now, cowboys and indians or good guys and bad guys, cops and robbers and get thrown out of school for that, if you're six, seven years old. That misses the opportunity to deal with real problems. 
>> That's right, and the opportunity to teach the child, just kicking him out of school or suspending him doesn't instruct him. And it's a larger trend, the country losing its sense of humor. 
>> Absolutely. 
>> Is it not possible to laugh things off anymore? 
>> I think that's a problem and also, a problem that we somehow think we can socialize children into being different beings than they are. You know, I'm a mother of three sons, when my three-year-old, my first son was three years I was one, no g.I. Joe, no guns, holesters and guns and I gave him legos and fitted the piece together and went around the house saying bam, bam, bam. And boys will be boys. 

[01:18:40]


>> Tucker: It's true. That's right. And why wouldn't any school or parent with the experience, your preconceptions are shattered by the realities of gender differences, they're inborn. 
>> Day one, little baby girls are different than baby boys. 
>> Tucker: And why shouldn't schools who have smart and wise people presumably recognize that? 
>> I think that schools are structured environment and frankly, little girl's behavior, a willingness to sit still, pay attention, not necessarily to talk and get up and run around the room is more conducive to a classroom setting. What we've done, trying to turn little boys into different forms of little girls and a lot has to do with the way that schools are structured. You take a six-year-old and sit him in a chair and expect that they're going to stay there. It isn't natural, frankly, it isn't natural for a lot of little girls, it's more for the convenience of teachers than it is accommodating to the child's needs. 
>> That's truly right. Little boys are savages, i don't mean that in-- it's just true. 
>> We can't change it, but thr he' lovable and grow up to warm, wonderful human beings when they get a little older. 
>> Tucker: Amen. On that hopeful note. Coming up, get an instant mood boost from botox. True, that story coming up and women all around put it on every day, but one woman gave herself a no makeup challenge for a year, claims it made her more beautiful. Is this a good lesson in vanity for all women? We report, you decide. Plus want to stay lean for life?

>> Oh, it's final for your news by the numbers. First up, 10 million dollars, that's how much money the obama inauguration team is hyped its fund raising goal. The commit helped to raise 50 million for the ceremony just a week away. Next, 460,000 dollars, that's how much this private three-acre florida island was LISTED FOR ON eBAY. The owner says he couldn't afford to build on it and put it up for auction. No one bid on the land. Good luck. Finally, 6,000, how many seattle residents took part in the world's largest snowball fight. About 162,000 pounds of snow were trucked in for the event. And it's now in the guinness book of world records. 
>> Mike: Another number for you, six, six commandments of get you back on the right back as far as your diet is concerned. 
>> Alisyn: Oh, good. You were vamping it's hard to know when my cue is. After the holidays overeating many of us making new years resolutions to lose weight. Like a reset button, but sadly rarely works, but a way to pull it off in less than two weeks. 
>> Mike: One of our good friends and a colleague, a news anchor for a station in new york city, fox 5, does a great job. A trained chef and an author of this book called "the quick and queen" look how pretty you are. 
>> Oh. 
>> Alisyn: Great to see you and have you back. Let's talk about your rules for getting us in shape. Everybody forgets about it. 
>> Scientifically proven, you stick to it two to four weeks and everybody jumps on the fad diets and they don't work, it's deprivation. 
>> Mike: Are you one of those people, I love this, that says you should eat often throughout the day. 
>> I am, one of those people who believes you should eat every three hours or one of those people, whoever works for you, but eat often because if you don't eat often, then what happens is you're starving, once you realize that you need to eat something and you choose the wrong things.

>> Mike: How do you get that done? Do you have food around you? 
>> U can absolutely pack stuff with you, and I'm not talking forging, bring almonds yogurt, a mid morning snack or apple, things that arab -- and that have so you don't go by the pizza. 
>> Alisyn: And you're making one of the dishes for us. What do you mean lean protein. Chicken? 
>> Tons of lean protein, obviously, fish is one of the low proteins, turkey can be lean protein, some people like pork, that's lean protein, you know, it's really anything that does not have a high level of fat. 
>> Dari, you're famous for your kabobs. 
>> Alisyn: What are you pigging-- 
>> paint a skewer. 
>> You start with lean. 
>> Exactly, lean protein and the idea is to stack it with as many vegetables and good stuff as you want. You know, when you're eating this way, you don't have to think about calories, another big thing, I don't think it's good to obsess about calories, who wants to do that. An accountant and you love numbers and you want to do that all day long, there's no reason to do that when you're eating well. So you can stuff a bunch of these as eat as many as you want because the idea really is to not feel like you're on one of those programs, where you're depriving yourself. 
>> Alisyn: Right, and you also say, we have heard this before, it's hard to do when you're hungry and want a snack, avoid processed foods. 
>> It's hard to do, impossible when you're really, really hungry, it's the easiest to find, processed food. 
>> Alisyn: Vending machines and snack bars. 

[01:27:53]


>> The drive through, the pizza place. Say if you made these and did a lovely job. 
>> Thank you, I make a good kebab. What do I slather it with? 
>> Slather it with a marinade, you can make any kind you want, depends on what your flavor thing is. But you know-- 
>> this is like soy sauce, ginger, garlic. 
>> And do it ahead of time and put it in the refrigerator and all of those marinaded so he there's really good flavor or the very last minute. And just put it on the grill and it can be, it doesn't have to be, you don't have to go outside, you can do one of the grills or grill pans on your stove top. 
>> Alisyn: Your book is terrific, dari alexander, great recipes and-- 
>> your name is dari, are you lactose intolerance. 
>> No. 
>> I'm into dairy. 
>> I'm not that into dairy. 
>> Mike: Interesting. 
>> Well, you know, it's just, I don't know. 
>> Mike: They're into you. 
>> I can he eat certain things, some things-- 
>> good to see you. How are the kids. 
>> Gralt. 
>> And I saw-- 
>> I saw you in philly. We don't see you. 
>> I love you and known for for years, you know that. 
>> Alisyn: And yeah. 
>> We were pregnant together. 
>> Tucker: I like watching that. But we're on to the next segment. 
(Laughter) 
>> this is so good. Oh. 
>> We were pregnant together. 
>> We were all pregnant together. 
>> We're going to get pregnant together. 
(Laughter) 
>> it's going to be a great after show today, I can tell you that, it's on the internet, stay tuned. But in this show, still ahead, an overweight woman, a very overweight woman falls to the sidewalk in new york. An unlikely hero saved her life. Yes, her waistline. And earth to tom cruise, why a new book says the actor was put on this planet to save us from aliens, more on this completely bizarre story coming up next. ???????????? with see. Great grains. Great grains cereal starts whole and stays whole. See the seam? More pcessed flakes look nothing like natural grains. I'm eating what I kn is better nutrition. Mmmm. Great grains. Search great grains and see for yourself.

>> your new miss america is... Miss new york. 
>> She wasn't even looking. She had averted her eyes. That was miss new york, mallory haggan crowned last night. And she beat out miss south carolina and miss oklahoma who came in third. She was originally from alabama and moved to brooklyn in 2008. The fourth new york miss america, the last was vanessa williams. 
>> But she's from alabama of course, like-- 
>> look at this, for her talent she wowed the crowd with a tap dance to james brown get up off that thing. And gretchen carl sn, when she won the crown. 
>> Mike: She won? 
>> What did your evening gown look like the night you won. 
>> This is the 80's and everything is big and that meant that the gowns weighed 20 pounds, full of beads, but the most important thing go with your gut. A lot of people said you needed to wear white to win and I wore blue because that's what I felt good in. 
>> That's gretchen in her blue gown. 
>> That's beautiful aring beautiful, very beaded. She was right. Speaking of which, let's talk about a woman who did something completely antithetical to being a pageant queen. This is a woman. Her book is making the round everywhere, called "the beauty experiment", this is a woman who decided to forego all hair salons, all makeup, all beauty products for an entire year and what she learned about herself and society. 
>> She was trying to teach us a lesson about vanity, right, a survey came out on friday that said that women look in the mirror 35 times every single day. Ali would you say you do that? 
>> I don't think I did. It's possible. I don't think I look in the mirror 35 times a day. I hope not, but I understand the problem because we are all a little addicted to makeup and getting to the hair dress her and the beauty products. I think it's brave for her to try to forego it for a year. 

[01:35:19]


>> Tucker: I bet her husband didn't notice. I bet only other women noticed. I'm serious, people-- there was a study recently that showed that women spend most of their time looking at other women, not in a romantic way, but to assess physical beauty. And women, have work done for other women and-- 
>> well, this woman named phoebe, she said that this-- a quote from her, I noticed a change in my inner voice, she had become softer and less judgmental and talked to herself, of me, and the women around me. Bad hair days meant nothing. And my face without makeup, not a hideous problem. 
>> And wait a second, she's totally cute and I'm not against this as an experiment or, and I'm definitely for deemphasizing physical appearance it's too important, however, you know, we don't want to be too ideological about it. Brush your teeth and comb your hair. 
>> Alisyn: Her only rules she would use sunscreen and moisturizer. 
>> What about deodorant. 
>> Alisyn: That's not a beauty product, that's a hygiene-- 
>> when you run to the deli, do you get made up. 
>> No, I put my hair up in a pony tail and in sweats and always see someone in that getup. And I take the subway, and in that outfit. Alisyn camerota, I can't believe that people can-- 
>> that's a compliment, you're recognizable without makeup 
>> Alisyn: People are observant. 
>> Mike: You've run into colleagues here, and oh! Like me, you don't know who they are. 
>> Alisyn: It is true. It happens. And why don't you send us your e-mails and tweet us, and find us at our name and let us know what you think about that beauty experiment. 
>> Mike: Here is a good looking man with or without makeup. 

[01:37:24]


>> Tucker: I saw him without makeup. 
>> Rick: Scary, all for a year without makeup as long as it's not a year without hygiene products. And alisyn, I he see her all the time at the gym without it, sleeping on the comfy couches. 
>> Alisyn: Relaxing. 
>> Rick: Take a look at the weather map, guys, waking up across the northern plains and it's cold, and that cold air is going to be with us for another three to four days across the areas of the west, around wednesday, starts to change, but you're waking up to a cold one. Let's look what's going on across the east. If it's cold somewhere, you got abnormally warm next to it. Look at the temperatures in o-o. And enjoy today, because the cold front is moving through and pick your city there. Now look at tomorrow and the temps drop out tomorrow across parts of the ohio valley and we're still hanging on to the 50's, boston down to d.C. And take a look at tuesday. And those are gone and once those are gone, they're gone, we're not going to be looking at those kinds of temperatures for a long time. In fact, the next two weeks or so looking like big blasts of extremely cold air. So, enjoy today, is what I'm trying to tell you. Take a look at your forecast today. In across the northeast, your highs 50's and 60's, a lot of fog and pretty significant cloud cover as well. Down to the southeast, another extremely warm day, florida, looking great. And the temps have been so warm all week long and people using the a.C. In january across areas of florida. Stormy conditions and rain continuing from louisiana up through kentucky and into the northern plains and the front moved through, but it's very cold. So you continue to see those temps into the single digits across much of north dakota and a few scattered flurries as welat times. Across the west, try things out, but that dry condition continuing to be cold and overnight lows below freezing in the desert, we have hard freeze warnings in effect all the way down to southeastern, arizona, as well as some of the low elevations across southern california. Another cold one tonight. Tomorrow night and tuesday night as well as we start to see things changing up there. Alisyn, did you take off your makeup. 

[01:39:31]


>> Alisyn: No, I don't want to, I'm too nervous. Thanks for the suggestion. The rest of your headlines, what else is happening while you've been sleeping. A look at paris, france, hundreds of thousands of people protesting the french president's plan to legalize same sex marriage there. People are expecting about 300,000 people to march towards the eiffel tower from three different points in the city, tying up traffic, closing subway stations for hours, this is expected to be the largest demonstration there in a decade a 400 pound woman says her size saved her life in new york. Yolanda williams, on the cover of the new york post. She was waiting for the bus friday night. Suddenly the side walk collapsed under her and she fell six feet into a building cellar. The fall was severe enough a thinner woman might have died. And-- 
>> saved by the belly. So the moral here is, eat up. 
>> Alisyn: I guess. 
>> True? 
>> Unless the sidewalk collapsed because of her weight. 
>> Ali. 
>> Alisyn: I don't know the answer to that, we'll find out. And meanwhile, botox can apparently fix your mood and your marriage. Good news, mike. According to washington d.C., dermatologist says that the toxin may make you appear less anger, and obviously selfless here, no self-interest. Botox paralyzes the frown muscles, making it more difficult to scowl and patients feel less depressed. I might want to see more studies. 
>> Tucker: A guy who sells botox, says that botox makes you happy. 
>> Mike: Hard to react to that, but I can't move my face. 
>> Tucker: There's a book out by scientology, won a itzer prize that was about al-qaeda, not a tabloid kind of guy. And says that he tom cruise was put on the earth to vanquish aliens. And what it's like inside the so-called church and turns out that the church apparently has chosen every one of tom cruise's girlfriends and wives. 

[01:41:54]


>> Alisyn: It's pretty scintillating stuff and tuck are tucker says it's not a journalist normally given to sensationalism, he was married to mimi rogers and he developed a crush on nicole kidman and then the church foe that he could marry nicole kidman and katie holmes was selected. But a lot of information from the girlfriend prior to katie holmes and when she did leave tom cruise one of her punishments was to scrub a public bathroom with a toothbrush. An amazing scene he's talking about having dinner with the person who runs the scientology and the new girlfriend the church fnd for him and she's feeling sick and not proply deferential to the head of the cult and cruise breaks up with her over it. 
>> Alisyn: And he says he's number three in the the operation and I was astounded by the salary he apparently gets, according to this, had a billion dollar a year contract. 
>> Tucker: No it's a billion year contract. 
>> For a billion years. 
>> Alisyn: I thought it was a billion dollar contract. 
>> Tucker: No, a billion years and he's number three in the organization. Number one perp in the dead is l. Ron hubbard. 
>> Mike: I think that tom cruise is doing a great job fighting aliens, when is the last time you've seen an alien on earth? Get off his back. And the people around the countries, the long lines? Philadelphia had to wait seven hours on thursday to get a flu shot. What are we going to do about this? We break down the difference between the needle and the nasal spray vaccination, just as good. 
>> Tucker: Forget the thin mint. Get your hands on the latest vitamin packed girl scout cookie coming up. ?????????????? ?? 

[01:46:44]


>> well, the flu is an epidemic in the u.S. For decades we had only one type of flu shot. And now the newer shot or the flu mist. Pediatrician joins us to explain the difference as well as how to prepare your kids tomorrow for school with all of this. Doctor, great to see you. 
>> Thank you, alisyn. 
>> Alisyn: What is the difference of the spray versus the shot? 
>> Well, they're two completely different vaccines. The shot is an inactivated vaccines, it cannot give you mild symptoms. 
>> Alisyn: That's a great myth. 
>> Right. 
>> Alisyn: People think I'm going to get the flu shot and get the flu. You're saying it's not a live virus. 
>> It's absolutely impossible. It's not a live virus vaccine, it cannot give you symptoms. 
>> Alisyn: The mist? 
>> The mist is a live virus and holding it up and see what it looks like. It's needleless and goes in the nose. It's a cold adaptive virus, when I put this in your nose, the virus itself cannot replicate at body temperature, but it can give some mild nasal symptoms, you may get a nasal congestion or a sore throat and common complaint after I've given them the vaccination. 
>> Alisyn: Otherwise, wouldn't everybody want the mist? They're afraid of shots. 
>> Kids, and some adults are afraid of shots, too. What happens though, this has a broader contraindication, so you cannot give in to children or adults with any type of chronic lung disease, like asthma or copd or anything, or anyone on chemotherapy or immuno compromised with a dulled immune system. Both are contraindicated in allergic people and-- 
>> not everyone can get this. 
>> And not everyone wants to suffer the possibility of maybe getting some nasal congestion the next day. 
>> Alisyn: Let's move on to kids are returning to school tomorrow amidst this epidemic, are schools just a petri dish of flu germs. 

[01:48:46]


>> Yes, they are. 
>> Alisyn: What are you doing, sending your kid back into the experiment? 
>> Teach the kids, one two and three, wash your hands, wash your hands, wash your hands and effective in hand washes and wash 15 to 20 seconds of running water and soapy water. Hand sanitizer works well also, so you can actually use hand sanitizer and dissolves the virus off your hands and you can do that. Keep your hands away from your face. We touch our face all day long and flu virus can live on inanimate objects. 
>> Alisyn: That's important one. A flu virus can live for how long on a desk? 
>> About two to eight hours and also, kids can excrete the virus before they're sick. One kid going into a classroom can sit on another kid sat on healthy and not realizing there's flu virus on the desk, but they're okay if they keep their hand away from their face and don't bite your nails. Everybody is putting their hand on their face, and touching food and-- I get my hands covered in flu virus all day long and washes my hands and not getting the flu and I've also been vaccinated. 
>> Alisyn: Wash your hands as often as possible and keep your hands away from your eyes and your nose and your mouth. Great tips. Have you ever heard of this one. A teacher with a phobia of children and it's a real phobia and now suing her school district over discrimination. The future of the auto industry. Live to the detroit auto show next. ???????????? 

[01:53:42]


>> it's the super bowl of auto shows. Where companies release the latest cars and the latest car technology. Joining us live from the auto show with the car czar, doug brown I remember. 
>> Good morning, tucker, it's the super bowl of car shows, and this is big. Three quarters after million people expected to come through the cobo hall in detroit. The economic impact. 400 million dollars money well needed in downtown detroit and this show is big this year. The automakers are back a saying that they are ready to show it off. We snuck in day early to show you what I think are going to be some of the the show stoppers. We'll start with this. I can see you on in this 7th avenue. All new from chevrolet, 2014 silverado. The truck that gm has been talking about and tested this thing for 17 million miles and it's all new, hood to hitch it starts at just under $25,000. And that's incredible and that's going to put a lot of pressure on ford and f-150. Inside the company is saying they'll give you more room and a lot quieter and amenities, starting price point under 25 grand and expected to get pretty good gas mileage. Lincoln, yeah, expect to hear about lincoln this year shall the final touches on their booth and it's about this car, nobody's seen this before. It's the mkz concept crossover and lincoln says it's the ultimate lucksly crossover, push button, stitching throughout. Ambient lighting everywhere and the up 200% in just four years, lincoln expects to hit it out of the park when it introduces that later today and then this from ford. Do not call it a mini-van. Ford says a transit wagon, seven passengers seating and notable, over 30 miles to the gallon. I have four kids, I guarantee they'll want one for the drop down tables and ford expects to release it sometime later this year. Don't call it a mini-van, by the way. And hyundai, a seven passenger vehicle. Seven passengers in and this is built for families specifically, but you still have space behind the third row for your stuff and in fact, holds a whole lot of stuff and go on sale in march under $30,000 and even the rear seats are heated for the little kids and this from acura, the new flag ship. Rlx and the headlights on this thing have little jewels to help disperse the light premium throughout, the back seat is huge and four wheels that steer, tucker, all four will move you, which makes this thing unbelievable when you're cornering on the freeway, new from acura and I'll tell you, they needed a new flagship and I think they really have one with the new rlx. 

[01:56:37]


>> Tucker: I am sold. I can't believe that silverado under 25 grand. I know you were joking when you say you've got to get one of these, I'm going to. 
>> Seriously, me, too, when was the last time you were drawn to a pickup truck and gm needed this tucker, because, the old silverado was steal, let's be be honest. And this they're putting a lot of of thinking it's a winner. 
>> Tucker: I wish it was before christmas. Doug, in detroit, thank you very much. The gun debate continues in washington this week, vice-president joe biden laid out his recommendations to the president. What can we expect when we hear about it next week? We'll ask chris wallace, he's joining us the top of the hour, because, bye-bye california, hello sin city? We'll tell you about a potentially massive deal that britney spears may be in vegas. ???????????? 
[ Male Announcer ] SOME DAY, YOUR LIFE WILL Flash before your eyes. Make it worth watcng. Introducing the 2013 lexus ls. An entirely new pursuit. 

[02:00:17]


>> Good morning everyone, it's sunday, january 13th, I'm alisyn camerota. They said no to the n.R.A., but the administration is getting ready for sweeping new gun proposals and words they may king points from a group. 
>> Tucker: And a teacher says she can can't teach because of a severe phobia shehas, she says she's afraid of kids. We will have the details. 
>> Mike: We showed you this picture. Kate's official portrait. Thumbs down from a lot of people even our critics and we'll ask our critic to weigh in. Is that beauty or kind of ugly? And "fox & friends" this sunday morning, is your third hour starts right now. ???????????? 
>> good morning, again, everyone, thank you for joining us, something important to come up. The top ten words you're most likely mispronouncing and you've been embarrassing yourself for years by mispronouncing and I can't believe how many words there i supposedly mispronounce. 
>> Mike: We found 11 I've been mispronouncing half of them. 
>> Tucker: It's not like you do them on tv. 
>> Mike: I knew the banal. 
>> Tucker: Who says that, that ought to be a felony. 
>> Alisyn: Well. 
>> Mike: Are you a numberologist. 
>> Alisyn: No. 
>> Mike: Today is 1-13-13. Do you know what it means? Don't look. 
>> Alisyn: Thank you mike for that. 
>> Tucker: Who is influencing the white houses gun control? It could be the n.R.A.? No, it's a left wing think tank funded by george soros, according to the washington post this morning has given a list of 13 or so gun control ideas to the white house, which they may act on by executive order. 

[02:02:28]


>> Alisyn: We're going to find out on tuesday, what the vice-president has come up with with his task force and it's interesting, one place that we've heard common ground, and as we heard reported perhaps the administration is considering putting armed guards in hools and that's one thing where it seemed like the n.R.A. And the white house and other people have suggested this over the the past week, since the newtown tragedy, maybe that was a point of commonalty, but what we're hearing if it's true that this left wing think tank really has the president's ear and the white house's attention then the they would not be happy. 
>> Mike: What's with the meeting last week with n.R.A., video game manufacturers, mental health experts? 
>> A listening tour, basically, that the vice-president said he's trying to solicit sgestions from as many different groups and corners as possible. 
>> Are they more influenced by the center for american progress. 
>> Tucker: Do you think. 
>> Mike: With the lolist. 
>> Tucker: And I guess what people botheelitism, with the body guards and not like the rest of us. And david gregory showed a magazine on television, he wasn't charged he wasn't doing anything threatening. 
>> Mike: A prop, show and tell. 
>> Tucker: Yet, I got an e-mail from a friend of mine who trains the military in combat techniques, what would happen if I drove into washington with a magazine in the back of my car and hit by a car and the police saw that magazine I'd go to jail. This is a military veteran and a person defending this country not making it dangerous, he would not get the benefit of the doubt here. There's a feeling that average people kind of get the shaft and no, you can't defend yourself. Yes, you are subject to the restrictive laws and the rest in congress and media aren't. 
>> Mike: What's going to happen on tuesday when the vice-president comes out with his recommendations from his panel there? Will he suggest armed guards in schools? And should it just be armed guards or how about, some people said let's arm teachers. 

[02:04:35]


>> Alisyn: That's in fact happening. One school district in ohio. 
>> Mike: They're going with custodians, aren't they. 
>> Alisyn: A new plan and that's to arm nonteaching employees, janitors and custodians, it's a voluntary program and so far here in they have to take a two day mange course and every school is trying something and desperate to make sure that nothing like newtown can happen if their district and have people, not teachers, but people in the schools with guns and they would have to train and practice a lot. In an emergency situation, just having a gun on you doesn't necessarily help. 
>> Mike: On the other-- remember what happened a month ago at new york empire state building. Some guy with a gun comes out and police surround him and they did get him. Nine people were shot, not by the perpetrator. Nine people shot were shot by the cops. Bullets were flying everywhere. 
>> Tucker: This is a complicated question and i respect people's concerns about kids. Reality check, our schools are very safe, actually. There are tragic school shootings, but the average student is not going to see anything like that in his lifetime. And the average school is a sanctuary and they're already safe, so deep breath. 
>> Mike: Exactly. Deep breath. 
>> Alisyn: Good point. Your headlines and tell you what else is happening at this hour, new york's governor declaring a flu imagine, temporarily suspend a law that bans pharmacies from vaccinating people from underage 18 and now they'll be able to give the shot to kids as young as six months old. With the outbreak reaching epidemic levels, many people are finding themselves waiting in long lines like this one to get the shot. Well, more than 200 protesters take to the streets of staten island,ew york, of course hit hard by superstorm sandy and frustrations boiling over this and many say that congress is dragging its feet on passing a bill to send more more aid. 

[02:06:36]


>> They did it with katrina in nine days, we're 70 days over, and what are we getting? 
>> There are many families down here, ones that pay taxes, pay their flood insurance, pay their home owners insurance and are now paying rent on top of everything else. They have the money, I'm sure each and every one of them got their christmas bonuses we're sitting here, sitting here trying to do everything ourselves. 
>> Alisyn: They have been waiting a long time and obviously very angry. The house of representatives are set to vote on the 51 billion dollar release bill on tuesday. This is good news on the condition of former president george h.W. Bush. Last night a spokesman for the 41st president said he could be released from a houston hospital this week, and president bush's son jeb is more optimistic and he says he thinks his father will go home tomorrow. The 88-year-old was admitted for a bronchitis related cough. 
>> Mike: What a night if you're a football fan. If you watched the broncos-ravens game. 
>> Tucker: No. 
>> Mike: It's an instant classic, we'll see it over and over again on espn. Under a minute to go, ravens q.B. Flacco hits the hail mary kind of pass and I don't know how he got behind the defense, in overtime peyton manning forces a pass and intercepted by the ravens and now in double overtime the ravens kick a game winning 47 yard field goal to stun denver and all of those fans, 38-35. And then in san francisco, another pretty good game. 49ers quarterback, colin kaepernick led them to a victory over the green bay packers and the quarterback himself rushed for 181 yards and two touchdowns, boy, having a great season. And he replaced the other quarterback earlier this season and got the a chance and took advantage of it. 
>> Alisyn: I knew that. 
>> Tucker: Fantastic. What is happening outside? We know what's going on in here in the studio, rick, how is it out there. 

[02:08:38]


>> Rick: It's really nice across the east and cold out west. And guess where the dividing line is, there, big storms, anywhere to the west, texas, oklahoma, kansas, texas is cooler. If your in front of that, it's warm, damp and mggy and foggy as well. Some of this rain falling so long, flooding concerns across parts of louisiana, and areas of louisiana well over a foot of rain this week so that's too much for you to get in such a short period of time. And rain spreaded into the ohio valley. Rain not snow because it's been so warm. The cold is goingo get here and much more like winter. This is where the flooding concerns are, flood watches and warnings, areas of red, flash flooding going on right now. Across parts of southeastern arkansas as well as tennessee and flooding up to areas of michigan and pennsylvania from the storm. You can see, that's where the rain is and where the front is, so anywhere to the east it's warm. 63 degrees we're in mid january in cleveland, and it's 63 degrees. Go back towards the west, and it's cold. 31 in phoenix, not normally see that kind after contrast, but the temperatures should be flip flopped this time of year, adding the wind and feels much colder, like minus 20 in denver and go up into the mountains and feels like minus 30, minus 35. Incredibly cold air out there. It's going to change by wednesday across parts of the west and tomorrow though, still another cold one. Warmth hanging on across areas of the southeast and florida looking still very warm, likely all the way until saturday or sunday. Guys. 
>> Mike: All right, now let's say that rick, does a great job with the weather was allergic to isobars, and could he sue the channel for making him do the weather? That's his job. It's kind of what's going on with a teacher, she says she's developed a fear in the classroom and the students are-- themselves. There she is right there. So, she's suing the school district because she has this fear of children and trying to teach french tohese children. 

[02:10:47]


>> Tucker: That makes total sense, I can't do my job, but you should be required to pay me if you don't, the government will punish you. If the department, civil-- division the justice department come to her aid. 
>> Alisyn:61 years old. A french teacher and the school district want today move her from high school where she's been teaching effectively for many years, to junior high. And so, she says that this phobia called pediphobia prevents her from being around children. 
>> Tucker: That aged children. 
>> Alisyn: Actually, I think that it's for younger children. I don't know if it's for middle school, but anyway, the symptoms, it actually is a real phobia and it's real and recognized, but extremely rare and here are symptoms, terror, dread, rapid heartbeat. Shortness of breath, nausea, dry mouth and anxiety. 
>> Mike: And the need to wear turtle neck sweaters. 
>> Alisyn: It did not say that. 
>> Tr: It might be time to work through your fears. The truth is we all have phobias, and we can work through them. Part of what means to grow. 
>> Mike: A lot of you weighed in. And look what jim said, the teacher were involved when she accepted the position, no one tricked her, she can get over it or resign. 
>> Alisyn: Well, she liked high school age better. 
>> Tucker: If the teacher who is suing because she has a phobia of kids is successful then I think I will be bringing my own lawsuit not because I have a phobia of kids, but because I just don't like them very much. They are sticky and messy, says fred. 
>> Alisyn: I hope fred is not a baby sitter. And kim says, so can I sue the nfl because I'm 5-6 and have a phobia of getting hit by a 6-4 linebacker, I really want to play football, tim. 
>> Mike: And that story on "fox & friends." Coming up, the gun debate rages on and we're talking about it this morning. What actual gun control recommendations will the vice-president, joe biden, present to the president on tuesday? Chris wallace is in d.C. Where it's going to happen on tuesday. 

[02:12:50]


>> Tucker: Next stop, sin city. We'll tell you about the potentially massive deal in the works for britney spears. ???????????? time drop? Campbell's has 24 new soups that will make it drop over, and over again. ?????? ?????? from jammin' jerk chicken, to creamy gouda bisque. See what's new from campbell's. It's amazing what soup can do. america. We don't let frequent heartburn come between us and what we love. So if you're one of them people who gets heartburn and then treats day afr day... Block the acid with prilosec otc and don't get heartburn in the first place! 
[ Male Announcer ] E PILL EACHMORNING. 24 Hours. Zero heartbur 

[02:15:18]


>> president obama will get gun violence control recommendations from joe biden on tuesday, what can we expect? 
>> Joining us right now, for fox news sunday today, chris wallace, good to see you. 
>> Hey, guys. 
>> Mike: Some predictions here. What do you think the vice-president's recommendations are going to be on tuesday? 
>> Well, I don't think it's actually too hard to predict. The vice-president has said a lot of it before he made the recommendations. I think you're going to see a call for a ban on assault weapons, some kinds of limits on the high capacity magazines that can hold 30 rounds or a hundred rounds. I think you're going to see a real big push for universal background checks on all gun sales, about 40% of gun sales at gun shows, especially, private sales, there's no background check and I think you're going to see that and then probably some tougher enforcement and crackdown on gun trafficking and not surprised if you saw some measures, I don't know if it will be legislation or voluntary calls for things like some kind of restraint in hollywood on these violent video games and movies and maybe some proposals on mental health care. 
>> Tucker: Chris, has the vice-president's office explained what that would mean, universal background checks, in every individual sale. If I sell you a gun, just the two of us, that we have to register with the government. Is that what that means? 
>> Yeah, that's exactly what it means. They say, look, you know, who is to say if you sell me a gun I'm stable or don't have all the problems that they don't want people to have, a criminal record, mental health problem. And yeah, and then obviously as you say that would involve a lot more paper work, regulation, and you know, so some people are going to oppose that because there are all kinds of-- people give guns to their kids or relatives or friends. But that's what one of the things that they're talking about, are universal background checks and the argument would be, and I can certainly understand the arguments against it, the argument would be, if the gun rights people say the problem isn't the weapon, it's the person. Then you've got to check the person out. 

[02:17:25]


>> Alisyn: Chris, let's talk about the politics of this, which of course are dicey. There's a report in the washington post today that the vice-president is getting some of the suggestions from center for american progress, a liberal organization in washington, and that one of the things that they are calling for is some executive action, that if the president can't get congressional consensus, that he unilaterally makes some move. Is at wise or unwise in this climate today? 
>> Let me just make it clear, ali. Most of the things I've talked about he couldn't do by executive action. He could do some things on the margin, better information sharing, the states, for instance, have a lot of information on mental health and criminal records and that doesn't get into the national data base. He can do some things to try to improve that, or improve enforcement. The n.R.A. Said let's enforce the laws already on the books. In terms of banning assault weapons or universal background checks, he couldn't do that by executive action. So, what he can do by himself is on the margins. 
>> Mike: Chris, who is on the show today? 
>> We'll be talking-- you talked of the american center for progress. We'll talk to the head of that and larry pratt of gun owners of america and a discussion between them. And it's very interesting, all right, let me tell that first and go back. We're also going to be talking about the president's confirmation takes on national security and we're going to talk to two members of the senate armed services committee and on chuck hagel, kelly ayotte, and richard blumenthal from connecticut. And let me go back, they are talking about, you know, some things they'd like to see happen and try to launch their own campaign. They know the power of the n.R.A., Theun lobby and try to create fund raising and their own support for a big campaign to try to persuade some of the members of congress is a good thing and-- 

[02:19:33]


>> a good get. Thank you, chris, we'll be watching. 
>> You bet, thanks. 
>> Tucker: We showed you this yesterday, kate's first portrait, profound thumbs down by some art critics. And how they made it ugly-- 
>> it's growing on me. 
>> Tucker:. 
>> Alisyn: And babies, when they cry. Do you let them cry it out? Let them cry it out. The advice of a new study. A pediatrician to answer whether that's the right strategy. And babies, look how well behaved these babies are. ???????????? 

[02:23:31]


>> oh, good, yummy. It's girl scout cookie time and this year,r, they're going healthy. The newest flavor, mango cream, a nutritious option, and girl scouts say the cookie fans are looking for a healthier choice. Is britney spears planning a big move to sin city. ???????????? 
>> tmz is reporting the pop star is close to inking a huge deal to headline in las vegas and spears could get paid more than 100 million dollars per year. Wow, life is looking up for the former x-factor judge who just split with her fiance on thursday. Here is ali. 
>> Alisyn: Listen up all you parents. You may be tempted to let your baby cry it out next time they wake up at night. It's important for babies to self-sooth in order to start life long good sleeping habits. And joining us is a pediatrician at washingtonville pediatrics in new york and she's going to help us unlock the secret to getting babies to sleep through the night. Great to have you here. 
>> Thank you very much. 
>> Alisyn: So many parents struggle with this, whether or not to let them cry it out or go in and suppose today pick them up or smooth them. Where do you fall on this debate? 
>> I'm very much into allowing a baby to fallasleep on their own. 
>> Alisyn: Even if it means they're crying for a long period of time. 
>> I think the way we do it at my practice, we start very early so we start talking about this when they come in, before the baby is even born. We talk about catching them when they're tired and putting them down before they start to get so upset and crying. And learning to fall asleep on their own and you don't have to deal with this with an eight month old screaming the whole night long. 
>> Alisyn: Great suggestion. These babies are well behaved. They're trick babies and make you think they're well behaved. And there's always a debate, i have lots of colleagues right now who are expecting. What's the advantage or disadvantage to a co-sleeper like this? 

[02:25:43]


>> Well, if there's two different meanings to co-sleeping, that could mean that the baby is sleeping in your room. 
>> Alisyn: Yes, in your bed even. 
>> That's a different meaning in your bed, okay? I don't recommend sleeping in the bed. There is so much evidence that a baby needs a safe sleeping environment, means a baby and a bed, their own bed, firm mattress, tight set of sheet, that's it. 
>> Alisyn: Do you like something like this, it's up next to the parent's bed and pick the baby out. 
>> Fine for the first few weeks, similar to having the crib next to the bed so you can get upn the middle of the night, feed the baby and baby back in the crib. 
>> Alisyn: What is your philosophy on wake and sleep? What should the parents be looking at for cues. 
>> For wake and sleep? Well, there are a lot of people that are proponents of sleep props. Sleep props. 
>> Alisyn: Pacifiers. 
>> Pacifiers could be one of them, but things like feeding the baby right before they go to bed, swaddling them up, rocking them. Walking over like this and putting them down. I think all of those things really don't teach the baby to do the sleeping on their own. So, sleep props I think get in the way and prolong this whole process. 
>> Alisyn: This little guy, oh, oh, what's going on over here. And here is a question, doctor. Pick up or put down. When the baby is fine, pick them up? 
>> Now is not bedtime. 
>> Alisyn: Oh, but pick up, if the baby is crying you always pick them up and help them. And he sees his daddy. Let's walk over here. 
>> At this point, yes, absolutely appropriate. >>, But sometimes in the middle of the night the baby might whimper and it doesn't necessarily mean pick-me-up, it might mean I'm tired and let me fall asleep. 
>> Alisyn: Do either of these babies have sleeping issues at night? Because you did the right thing. 
>> Yes. 
>> Alisyn: What was that. 
>> Cry it out. 
>> Alisyn: How about this guy? A good sleeper. He is a good baby. What's your name? 

[02:27:43]


>> Andrew. 
>> Alisyn: Andrew, you are a good, good baby. 
>> They're my parents. 
>> Alisyn: And take away for parents, one thing to tell them is what. 
>> Follow your baby's cues, pick an early bedtime between seven or eight. When they're tired put them down and allow them to cry a little bit. And self-sooth, they will fall asleep. 
>> Alisyn: That's the answer. Dr. Suzanne, thanks so much and thanks to you guys and the kids. They're great. 
>> Thank you so much. 
>> Alisyn: All right. Meanwhile, coming up, a year ago today, the costa concordia crashed on the coast of italy with thousands on board. Two survivors share their firsthand account next. Plus, a new miss america takes a crown. And we reveal the winner coming up. 
>> I think so, it will be in great hands. Here we go. Ladies and gentlemen, miss america is... ?????? My one and only baby, my one and only baby ?????? ?????? be my baby now, whoa, whoa, oh, oh ?????? ???????????? ???????????? 

[02:31:33]


>> welcome back, and beauty is in the eye of the beholder, but the first official portrait of the duchess of cambridge, many saying it makes her look old and dowdy. 
>> Mike: And our next guest to analyze it for us, matt sweetwood, president of unique photo, a huge operation in huge, right. 
>> That's correct. 
>> Mike: Good to have you here. 
>> Great to be here. 
>> Mike: It took this portraitist, three and a half months to create of this kate middleton. What do you think of it? T's not what I think of it. It's the question of whose portrait it is. 
>> She likes it. 
>> We have a lot of portrait photographers in our store and one of the first rules, you ask your subject what they want the portrait to be. She's a historical figure, I'm sure she sees herself like that, she is not a model on vogue magazine and I think of it in the reverse, imagine if they had portrayed her as a 18 or 20-year-old the artist could have done that then we would be talking ow they objectify women and made her a beauty and it's not really what she's about and I'm guessing she's thinking, look, this portrait will be there a long time and a lot of history that goes on for me, I'm going to be ruling a nation or whatever her position will be, and I really want to be remembered for the things that I do, not for the way I look. And that's what I'm guessing that she did. A lot of people are like that when they want portraits. They don't wan retouched portraits. 
>> Tucker: Tn from my perspective, it looks like a photograph and it doesn't look like a conventional oil painting. 
>> That's the artist's style. I wouldn't want a picture like that done of me, air put on me, things like that, it looks like an untouched photograph like if you look at a photographers work before they actually put a photo shop-- 

[02:33:38]


>> it looks like an untouched photograph when she's 40 or 35, and not now. And kate apparently asked to be depicted in her national state and not official state, maybe you said for posterity. To be used for generations to come, but she does look older. There are bags under her eyes and she doesn't have the sort of color to her skin that she has in real life. So, maybe he went overboard. 
>> It could be, but she has some, I guess, say in what the final product is. If she didn't like it, would have made him redo it. 
>> I bet we wouldn't have this reaction if it's a man. If they would have done it of charles or william, we wouldn't. She's a pretty woman and we want to see her like a pretty woman like she is now and when it happens, people get upset. 
>> Is there any person on the planet, gay, straight, in between, whatever, who is going to stair at a portrait of a man. 
>> Certainly not me, I'm from jersey. 
>> Alisyn: That says it all. And the president of unique photo in jersey, nice job. 
>> Go out to rick and the weather. 
>> What about pippa. 
>> That's what they want to know, pippa. 
>> Rick: Gold temps are uncomfortably and actual air temperature minus 6 in denver and 31 in phoenix. It does not happen often. How about 21 in el paso. That's how cold it is. Warmer across the east and also foggy so we have all kinds of fog advisories for about 16 different states. And starting in maine to the mid atlantic, the roads are dangerous at times and headed through some of the mountain passes and the valleys and give yourself plenty of time. And georgia and coastal areas, we're going to see much of the fog throughout the morning. Take a look at your forecast through the day. Once that mixes up, we'll see the cloudy conditions across the northeast and temperatures are very nice, at 63, you see in akron, enjoy it. TOMORROW, BACK DOWN TO TjE 40's and see the showers slowly move off towards the east and heavier rain across parts of the southeast and actually that kind of middle mississippi river valley in towards ken-- kentucky and tennessee. And 43 for a high today in abilene. And only 1 for a high in grand forks, north dakota. Very cold there. 18 in alliance, nebraska, across the west, we'll continue to see more sunshine, but very, very cold temperatures. Back to you inside. 

[02:36:21]


>> Mike: Thank you. 
>> Alisyn: Okay, let me first tell you your headlines and get to what I know you're dying to do over there. 
>> Mike: Chomping. 
>> Alisyn: The news at this hour, on the heels of reviewing national gun safety laws. Vice-president biden offered to talk one-on-one with the families of the newtown school shooting, a group called sandy hook promise has been working with the families since the massacre and say they will he' help coordinate any conversation between the families and the vp. The white house says we remain in touch with families from newtown and we'll present an opportunity for all of them to share their views before the president makes any decisions. Well, the italian of-- they're releasing footage. And two passengers shared their incredible story of survival. 
>> We made it to a life boat and as our life boat was being lowered down to the water, it kept banging into the ship because the ship was leaning over so severely b that point that our life boat couldn't go down. So they hauled it back up to where we started. 
>> We eventually got off the ship by tying knots on ropes and rappel down the side of the cruise liner. 
>> Alisyn: Tonight, a mass will be held in italy for the 32 victims who died. 32 illuminated lanterns released into the sky marking the exact moment that the concordia crash into a bed of rock. Robert f. Kennedy, jr. Speaking out saying that not all of the president-- not all the kennedys I should say, believe that jfk was killed by one shooter. During a ceremony in texas honoring his uncle's death and he says his dad did not secretly agree with the findings of the warren commission report. Says it was full of problems and also says he's convinced by the evidence that lee harvey oswald did not act alone. All right, meanwhile, your new miss america is in a new york state of mind. 

[02:38:25]


>> Your new miss america is... Miss new york. 
>> Alisyn: I'm still nervous every time I see it. Miss new york crowned the winner last night in las vegas. The 23-year-old beat out first runner up miss south carolina and miss oklahoma who came in third. And she's originally from alabama, but moved to brooklyn in 2008. Our own miss america, gretchen carlson was there, sharing moments when she won that crown. 
>> What did your evening gown look like the night you won? 
>> Brook, remember this was the '80s, everything was big and meant that the gowns weighed about 20 pounds, full of beads, but the most important thing go with your gut and a lot of people said you had to wear white to win, but I wore blue because that's what I felt good in. 
>> Alisyn: Check out gretchen carlson in that very blue gown looking good. 
>> Mike: Ali, do you read dr. Suess' books to your children. 
>> Alisyn: I call him dr. Suess. 
>> And we mispronounce words. 
>> Tucker: Can you mispronounce a made up word? 
>> Dr. Suess. 
>> Alisyn: And what do we mispronounce. 
>> I have been saying kibosh. 
>> Alisyn: No, I think kibosh. 
>> No, kibosh. 
>> Tucker: I think you've been pronouncing it correctly. 
>> Alisyn: I've been saying kibosh, you were right. 
>> I'm brilliant. 
>> Alisyn: How do you say boston celtics. 
>> Tucker: Celtics. 
>> Alisyn: You say it's boston celtics. 
>> Tucker: No, celtics. 
>> Like the music. I've been saying comptroller, there's a p. 
>> Alisyn: I know and a t, or an m. 

[02:40:26]


>> Tucker: But they're silent. 
>> Alisyn: You're supposed to say comptroller for controller? 
>> What about cache? It's a cache. 
>> Tucker: If something has cache. 
>> Alisyn: It needs a t for cache, otherwise cache. Banal. 
>> Mike: Banal. 
>> Tucker: It's not banal. Don't make that mistake. And niche. 
>> Mike: It's niche. 
>> Alisyn: I say niche, is that wrong. 
>> Tucker: I think it's niche. 
>> Tucker: The truth is english is a language and we're going to define those as we choose. How do you pronounce words. Which do you have trouble pronouncing correctly, and have you embarrassed had your self. E-mail and tweet us. 
>> Alisyn: Affluent or affluent. 
>> Mike: Affluent. 
>> Alisyn: Affluent. 
>> Mike: What about advertisement or advertisement. 
>> Tucker: Come on. 
>> Alisyn: Yeah, come on. 
>> Mike: I said advertisement once and laughed out of the room. 
>> Tucker: Unless you're from great britain. 
>> Mike: A liberal tv host probably heard him, calling on the president to ban the bible at inauguration, get rid of it. Is that a war on christianity? Oh, it's sunday. That means it's time for father jonathan morris. 
>> Tucker: And the oscars are out. And the biggest snubs. ???????????? 

[02:44:51]


>> welcome back, everybody. Well, pastor chosen to deliver the benediction at president obama's inauguration will no longer take part in the event. He withdrewfter a sermon he gave years and years ago about gay marriage when it surfaced. 
>> Tucker: This caused a firestorm on the left and led some to attack the bible itself. Watch this. 
>> The president, following one of our most assertive traditions in the government that invented separation of church and state will put his hand on this book filled with things he does not believe, filled with things that no one in the united states of america believes, and with his hand on this book, he will recite the oath of office. 
>> Tucker: And get that most absurdist. And father jonathan morris, what do you make of this. The most absurdist? 
>> Most absurdist, no doubt, right after the fact that there's a wave of intolerance sweeping this country. Intolerance of any public expression of god or religion, it's a wave and sweeping this country. 
>> Tucker: Where is it coming from? 
>> Certainly interest spokes people, activists who would like to wipe the face of god not only of public conscious. 
>> Alisyn: What he's saying, he doesn't believe that president obama believes every word of the bible. If you don't believe every word and many americans don't. 
>> Because we don't practice all ten commandments take them down from the courtroom. Right now it totally makes sense to do what he is suggesting, get rid of the bible, get rid of any prayer in the inauguration, right? We should get, totally take "in god we trust" off the dollar bill. We should absolutely get rid of any expression whatsoever of religion, if we believe, if we believe that true meaning of separation of church and state means that god stays within the walls of a church. And that's what these activists are doing. We should also take the mention of god out of our constitution, in god we trust, really? 

[02:47:18]


>> Well, this guy is not going to be happy, the president is going to double down, he's going to have two bibles, one from abraham lincoln and martin luther king. 
>> Well done, but as I said in god we trust, one nation under god out of our constitution, and get rid of it altogether and if you believe what these activists believe, that is that this is bad for our country. But you know, with the president doing the two bibles, mike, I think it's a wonderful thing he's doing it, but if you take the bibles and rip the pages out of them and that's what we're doing in our culture, we still believe in the bible, but nothing that's said within it. It's like a tabernacle with no eucharist, like a church without pews. Worship without any liturgy whatsoever and that's what we're doing, we're emptying all of these good things of their meaning and when we do, when we empty them, that topples and-- 
>> and when you remove god from the equation, again the church is, I mean, rather the state is the final north on everything. There's no appeal beyond the government. And that's what some people want. 
>> And our founders of our country and the great tradition of the united states has always been-- 
>> and others in the constitution they have to use the bible. In fact, george washington at the inauguration, let's just use the bible. 
>> One president chose not to, teddy roosevelt way back in the the day. 
>> It's allowing our politicians to be who they are. And thank god president obama is deciding. Instead of doing anything that anybody doesn't agree with. 
>> Alisyn: Thank you, father jonathan. And next on the president's immigration reform, and does that mean amnesty for illegal aliens. A live report from washington. 
>> Tucker: Awards season is in full swing. Oscar snubs and surprises, both coming up. ???????????? ???????????? set? I've got two tickets to paradise! Pack your bags, we'll leave tonight. Uhh, it's next month, actually... EDDIE continues 

[02:50:11]


singing: Two Tickets to... Paradiiiiiise! No four. Remember? Whoooa whooaa whooo! You know Ronny, folks who save hundreds of dollars by switching to GEICO sure are happy. And how happy are they Jimmy? Happier than Eddie Money running a travel agency. Get happy. Get GEICO. Fifteen minutes could save you fifteen percent or more. 

[02:52:52]


>> Awards season is in full swing with the golden globes set to take place tonight. All abuzz about the oscar nominations and snubs and surprises this week. 
>> Mike: Joining us for the oscar roundup. Kevin mccarthy, this was a bad year for nominees, and first i thought of was ben affleck in argo. 
>> The worst decision I've he seen from the academy since 1999 when they gave "shakespeare in love" best picture over "saving private ryan." Ben affleck has one of the best films, the airline, smooth as silk according to tony mendez, he's a brilliant director and snubbed beyond belief academy. 
>> Alisyn: Why did they snub him? 
>> They are out of touch. I don't know what they're thinking, but I was at the critics choice awards and I'm a voting member and voted for ben affleck for best director and surprised and made a funny joke about the oscar snub, here is the video. Check this out. 
>> I would like to thank the academy-- I'm kidding, I'm kidding. This ishe one that counts. 
>> There you go. Very gracious. 
>> And the critics awarded him. 
>> Yeah. 
>> And that was the worst snub I've seen in years and moving on, tom hooper for "les mis." I mean, those actors sang live for 12 hours a day, we had an intimate experience how could you not nominate that. Nine best pictures. You have to have nine best directors. The films did not direct themselves. Unbelievable. And katherine bigelow, this amazing film, "zero dark thirty," the last 40 minutes of that movie are some of the most intensive' seen in years. She took a ten-year story and compacted it to two and a half hours and gave us an incredibly emotional journey of jessica chastain's acting. By the way, what this does now, now that those three are out of the picture we're left with frontrunners, lincoln, versus silver linings play book. And interesting about "lincoln", a steven spielberg film has never won an academy award with best actor and actress, that will change with daniel day-lewis. And silver lining play book, first since "red", for all categories. 

[02:55:43]


>> The roan why the academy liked "lincoln" most of them actually knew them. 
>> Exactly. 
>> That's a line and I stole it. 
>> They're just so out of touch. 
>> Tucker: What about leonardo dicaprio. 
>> Alisyn: Did he deserve something. 
>> He's nominated three times. They're going to give him the martin scorcese effect. And let him win later on in his career for a film that's not deserving. And martin scorcese, why didn't he win for taxi driver. And gary oldman, tinker tailor, soldier spice. And jvier bardem, a bond actor has not been nominated. Tommy lee jones and alan arkin weren't as good. And what was your surprise. 
>> The nomination for the nine-year-old, as well as emanuel ariffa for the 85-year-old. The youngest and oldest actress nominations in the history of the academy many and by the way. Emanuel turns 86 the night of the academy awards, that's cool. 
>> Alisyn: And kevin, thank you. 
>> Thank you so much, guys. 
>> Tucker: People across the country waiting in line to get a flu shot as the outbreak spreads and now a second state declared a health emergency. The latest on the epidemic. 
>> Mike: An overweight woman falls through a sidewalk, and saved by the belly. An unlikely hero. We'll explain after the break.

>> Morning everyone. It's sunday january 13th td. I am alisyn camerota. Who is really influencing the white house when it comes to gun. It could be a liberal think tank in dc. We will explain that story today. 
>> Coming up on the president's to do list immigration reform. What does that mean exactly? Does it mean amnesty for illegals? Take a look at his plan. 
>> A woman's year long challenge. Lose some makeup all together. Is this a good lesson in vanity or a stunt gone way too far? We report, you decide. 
>> Image this without makeup. 
>> Yikes. 
>> Fox and friends 4th hour on a sunday starts right now. 
(Rooster crowing) 
>> I started this morning with 
-- saw you this morning without makeup you looked exactly the same. 
>> Thank you. 
>> Except you have red hair in real life. 
>> Thank you so much for joining us. Mike is sitting in for the vacationing clayton morris. Let's talk about the top story that is what can happen on tuesday when the vice president reveals the proposals he comes up with to combat gun violence. We will find out if he was listening to all people at the white house like the nra or is if there is a liberal think tank called center for american progress that actually has had the vice president's ear and they have 13 proposals. 
>> You know about them. Center for american progress. 
>> It was started by chief of staff for bill clinton. These are not new proposals. A lot of these groups have h these lying around for years waiting for an opportunity to impose them on the country. This is clearly an opening for them. What's interesting is this contains one of the proposals is universal background checks is term for universal gun regulation. It will no longer be illegal if congress passes it for anybody to give a shot gun for his son tore christmas without notifying the federal government and getting a background check and registering the weapon. 

[03:02:20]


>> On that note this article in the "washington post" says there'stimated 40 percent of gun sales that happen no questions asked. 
>> That is one of those numbers throw around in the media not at all clear where that comes from at all. 
>> It doesn't say the source but that is a shocking number if that is true. 
>> It is pretty hard to know something like that because we don't. That's a pure estimate. I bet you 20 bucks. I don't know the answer but i bet you 20 bucks that comes from gun control. 
>> You have been talking to people in washington, d.C. The recommendations are coming out tuesday is there a point there will be compromise? 
>> Here's where the compromise will come? I think a lot of conservatives second amendment advocates believes what everyone believes it's a bad idea for mental patients to get firearms who aren't responsible for themselves who are violent and bent on harming others because they are deranged. Clearly against gun violence. That's bad thing that shouldn't happen. What kind of law do you craft? How do you preserve the right of decent people to have firearms protect themselves while preventing nut cases from getting there. 
>> Much harder than it sounds. One thing everybody is calling for is stricter mental health background someone is under the care of sort ofthe doctor or on some sort of prescription medication might be helpful to know. The proof will be in the pudding on tuesday. We will find out who has the most influence when they hopefully make public what the recommendations are. 
>> I would like to -- I hope we have a conversation about prescription medication on people's behavior. There's some evidence a number of these shooters in the past couple years were taking antipsychotic medication. Did that contribute? I have no idea. Worth having that conversation. 
>> Have a big discussion in congress but if you have an executive order the discussion will go away quickly. 
>> Anybody watch janeane's show last night? It goes back to the journal news the newspaper that covers three counties above new york city. They published the names of anybody in the three counties that had a gun. 

[03:04:31]


>> So judge jeanine was one of those people. She has it to proteherself from all of the people she she tried to get the answer from the editor and publisher as to why they did that. 
>> Why won't you talk to us? You ll me why you guys released the names of the gun owners is? 
>> I am sorry. 
>> Hi, janet. 
>> As you can see we had the door slammed right in our face. 
>> She was talking a janet, janet the publisher. 
>> She is apparently one of the decision makers who stand by that decision to publish the names and addresses as well as the editor karen mcbride. 
>> So judge janeane did weigh in on this. She crystallizes so many things. Here is judge jeanine pirro summing it up. You think it's important to out us in the after math of the newtown shooting? How dare you connect law abiding citizens who have gone through rigorous background checks, who have been finger printed investigated and received judicial approval to exercise their second amendment rights. How dare you comparem to a nut job on the lunatic fringe in desperate need of medication, playing violent video games for days at a time. This animal massacred innocent babies. He didn't have a pistol permit. He didn't go through a rigorous background check to get a pistol permit. He took someone else's gun. By the way, although it's none of your business there's a reason people have guns. We don't need your sank moan why yous sank moan why yous permission. You dare put our familys in danger you pry in our lives and put our privacy and security and our safety in jeopardy and then you have nothing to say? How about I say it for you. You are nothing but a bunch of power unwilling to defend yourselves frozen in fear, you screwed up, period, end of story. 

[03:06:52]


>> Judge jeanine hit on a lot of points but why can't we have a conversation. If ty stand by their position why can't they come on judge's show. 
>> They must believe what they are doing is right so come on and explain. 
>> The media agitates for more gun control that exempts itself. Gregory breaks the gun law and all of his friends in the media defend him because he's not a fret but you are mr. And mrs. America you are a threat. 
>>> President obama setting his sights on the next major overhaul after all of this and that he is immigration system. He plans to give a pass to citizenship reportedly but there are already republican challenge in the works. 
>> Jennifer griffin joins us from dc. Hi, jennifer. 
>> Good morning, guys. 
>> The president vowed to take up immigration reform in one large omnibus bill. Marco rubio of florida whose parents were exiled from cuba accs the preside isoning the well for those who want a current overall of the current immigration laws including last minute laws issuing work permits and halting deportations prior to the election. In a wide ranging interview in the wall street journal rubio explains why republicans must embrace immigration reform and outlines what he hopes to be his signature plan, quote. I think it's a rhetoric by a handful of voices in the minority but loud none the less that have allowed them to create an unfair perception that conservatives and republicans are anti hispanic and anti immigration. And we have to over come that. I don't think there's a lot of concern in this country we will get over run by pac's and entrepreneurs. There are 12 million illegal workers in the u.S. But only 6.5 percent of those came here based on unique education or skills. They wanted visas for unskilled labor but stands behind having employers do background checks. Rubio wants four or five laws passed rather than an omnibus bill that is easily blocked. He wants to make it easier for those with skills engineers and tech savvy immigrants. The president wants a pathway to citizenship for those already here and vowed to help children of illegal immigrants. 

[03:09:18]


>> These are young people who study in our schools, play in our neighborhoods, friends with our kids. They pledge allegiance to our flag. They are americans in their heart, in their minds, in every single way but one, on paper. 
>> If the president wants to over hall immigration he will need to convince big labor to get on board. Marco rubio sees this as a gateway issue for hispanic voters which could lead to some migration to the republican party if successful. 70 percent of the 12 and a half million latino voters ca votes for the president in the last election. 
>> Thanks. 
>> Let's get to the headlines right now. If you are just waking up good news for many new yorkers who were wanting the vaccine to vaccinate their kids during the flu outbreak. Governor cuomo declared a flu emergency. Many people looking to get the vaccine have been met with long lines like those you just saw as they scramble to get the shot and there has been a shortage nationwide as well. Egyptian president must be reck mubarek granted an appeal by the courts. This is a video of the people celebrating. It was to prevent the killing of hundreds of protestors. Their death came during rallies that toppled his regime nearly two years ago. No date has been set for the 84-year-old retrial. 
>>> A spokesman for the 41st president said he could be released from a houston hospital this week. President bush's son jeb was even more optimistic saying he thinks his father will go home tomorrow. He was admitted for a bronchitis related cough. 
>> A 400 pound women says her size saved her life in new york city. This is yolanda williams. She was waiting for the bus friday night when the sidewalk collapsed under her. She fell 6 feet into a building cellar broke her arm in two places. They had to use a crane and cargo net to get her out. The fall was severe enough a thinner woman could have died.

>> Top is the grim one month anniversary of the massacre i knewtown, connecticut. The president is getting ready to unveil the gun violence prevention proposals. 
>> I come to this meeting with no judgment. You all kno the judgments other people have made. And I think we had a very productive meeting yesterday with the film industry and they had some very constructive ideas as to how they could help. 
>> Our next guest says surprised the move the obama administration made a former west point psychology professor the author of "on killing kernel" the vice president is approaching his meeting with hollywood entertainment people with no judgment. That's not how he approached the nra. 
>> In july the year 2000 both houses of congress a joint statement was made by the american medical association, american psychological association and american academy of pediatrics 30 years of research. A thousand solars have proven media violence causes violence in our society. They said violent video games are particularly dangerous. 
>> We have that statement. It bears repeating. They said specifically preliminary studies indicate the negative impact of electronic media such as violent video games may be significantly more severe than that brought by television, movies or music. 
>>> This is the factor. The video game generation jonesboro high school, virginia tech in the college is now coming to kill our kids. This ain't the end of it. They are coming to the daycare centers and elementary schools and school buses. We have raised a generation of children taught to kill. They are going to get their 15 minutes of fame. It's my job to teach cops to kill and concealed permit holders to kill. I have a best selling video series for concealed weapons holders to be mentally prepared for the battlefield the same thing is being done to children without the training. 

[03:18:02]


>> When you train them to kill how dowdy sense ties them? Do you use video games? 
>> The simulators are widely used. Every law enforcement officer trains in a realistic simulator. They hold a realistic gun in their head. When the bad guy needs to be shot they shoot. It's conditioned response. Precognitive loading. You don't have to think. If a bad guy says I am going to shoot without conscious thought what we do with the video games since they are five years old they play grand theft auto practice blowing cop as heads off. It is conditioning it is classical conditioning. They are taught to associate reward like pavlov's dog. They are taught to associate rewards with inflicting death and suffering. 
>> If everything you are saying makes sense completely what do we do now? We established I guess I didn't know until this moment these video games to precipitate violence and cause violence, what do we do? 
>> We have to treat violent visual imagery like alcohol or tobacco or firearms or automobiles or sex. These are all things adults can have but kids can't. Anybody who tries to inflict sex on my grandchildren is an abomination. Anybody who tries to inflict alcohol or tobacco on my children are an abomination. Anybody who tries to inflict violent imagery on children is an abomination. Especially the violent video games should be treated just like alcohol or tobacco or automobiles or firearms. 
>> Or pornography for that matter. 
>> Yes. Exactly right. Pornography.

>> I work for a morning show in philadelphia on fox we are constantly talking about our concern for athletes in high school playing football or hockey or whatever. There's a concussion monitor which I think could be a huge break through, folks.

What is amazing about that is say you have a player on the field they get hit with high impact it will send the data to a coach or clinician on the field. Data doesn't lie.

I've been fortunate to win on golf's biggest stages. But when joint pain and stiffness from psoriatic arthritis hit, even the smallest things became difficult. I finally understood what serious joint pain is like. I talked to my rheumatologist and he prescribed enbrel. Enbrel can help relieve pain, stiffness, and stop joint damage. Enbrel may lower your ability to fight infections. Serious, sometimes fatal events including infections, tuberculosis, lymphoma, other cancers, nervous system and blood disorders, and allergic reactions have occurred. Before starting enbrel, your doctor should test you for tuberculosis and discuss whether you've been to a region where certain fungal infections are common. You should not start enbrel if you have an infection like the flu tell your doctor if you're prone to infections, haveuts or sores, have had hepatitis b, have been treated for heart failure, or if you have symptoms such as persistent fever, bruising, bleeding, or paleness.

It cannot happen where you have a few days in a row where your high temperatures are only in THE 40s. Move forward look what happens tonight. The temperatures really plummet again. Everybody I have been hearing on twitter p and facebook are saying it's the coldest they have ever experienced. Get ready you have two or three nights of cold temperatures. It's wednesday when we start to see a turnaround. Look at what it is like across the rest of the country. Cold aur across the rockies. A couple hours ago 63 at cleveland now you are at 48. Changing the temperatures very quickly. Move forward you can see that pink color there. That is brutally cold arctic air across canada. Move forward we see by tuesday things warm up a tiny bit across parts of the west. Go toward thursday that pink gets much closer toward the great lakes and toward the northeast. I think over the next two weeks we will deal with a couple of bouts of the air getting in towards great lakes an the northeast. Get ready. Winter is going to return by the time we get to around thursday for many people across the northeast it will be a big slap inhe face. Forecast quickly across the northeast.

Pte is completely preventable. You don't get hit had the head up won't get this devastating disease. Especially with so many children playing contact sports. 
>> Football is a contact sport. For adults what's the solution? Chances are you are going to get hit in the head. 
>> Correct. Confo -- informed consent. If you get hit in the head you might have bad outcomes. You are allowed to do dangerous jobs as long as you know have informed consent like policemen like military.

>> What do you think will be the future of football? Does this change the future of this work? 
>> I think it changes how we play it. If we play it more safely going forward. I don't think we have to worry about the nfl going away. With the idea of informed consent they have the nfl ers to negotiate the safety. This will dramatically change youth football. If we know the nfl is so dangerous and we have to pay the millions of dollars exposed to this danger how are we doing this for children for free bh when he don't give them athletic trainer on the side lines to diagnose the injuries this he get.

Hello again from fox news in washington. In the wake of a newtown school shootings, washington is getting ready for a battle over how to prevent more acts of mass violence. Joining me now are two people of the center of what is likely to be one of the first big political issues this year. Larry pratt executive director for gun other thans of america and neera, president of the center for american progress. Welcome to both of you to "fox news sunday." 
>> Thank you. 
>> Thanks. 

[00:02:02]


Chris: I want to put up remarkable numbers I saw. The nra contributed 20 million today's federal campaigns last year, $20 million and gun control groups gave $4,000. And 50% of the members of the new congress, in fact, more than half have an a rating from the nra. Given all of that, how do you and other groups that feel as you you to hope to take on the gun lobby in practical terms? How do you match their money and their clout on capitol hill? 
>> Look, are the nra is spent a lot of money on the elections last cycle and they didn't have to lot to show for it especially if you look at the senate. A lot of their candidates lost and they had a very if we are looking at return on investment they had a very low return on investment. Of course, the nra s a strong lobby. The issue here is who s going to represent the voices of the american people in this debate. Things that seem like common sense to the american people. They scrub stand that we need to protect people's right to own a gun in their own home and protect themselves but there is something tragically wrong when there is mass slaughter so we have to solve this problem and I think getting -- 
>> Chris: It are you going to launch a campaign. Talk about raisin money and big grass roots organization. 
>> And the thing is bringing the voices in. We need the leadership of the president and I expect the president president to play a strong leadership role. Progressive organizations will work in the states and make sure that we have the voice and we wily have the american people and even gun owners who is support these proposals their voices at the table as well. 
>> Chris: Mr. Pratt, I think you you would agree the national wave of horror over the slaughter of the 20 small children in newtown, last month, do you see any sign that mrs. Tanden and allies can change the national conversation and get members of congress to pass the first tough gun controls sin 1994? 

[00:04:04]


>> We don't think that there is much likelihood that the congress is going to move on making gun control laws worse than they are. In fact, already there are a couple of bills that have been put in one by representative steve stockman outside of houston that would remove the gun free zones that have been so much like a magnet to invite mass murderers into zones where they know nobody else will be able to shoot back. And that I think is where the debate is likely to shift. Are we really better off when we say no defense is a good defense? 
>> Chris: I want to put up an ad that gun control advocates have started running against new democratic senator heidi hei dcamp of north dakota when she said some of the present's ideas about gun control are extreme. Will that work. Can ms. Tanden and their allies and they have suggested they can drive a wedge between people like you, the heads of the nra and some of their members who may not be as hardline as you guys are on gun controls? 
>> I think the senator from north dakota is reflecting the views of the people that sent her to washington. So I don't think there is much room to drive any wedge. I think she is representing them rather faithfully and i think it is noteworthy that a democrat who would be under a lot of pressure within their are caucus to take a gun control point of view is not having anything other. 
>> That s not true. Heidi heidcamp has heard from both sides of the issue and now said she is open to discussion of the issues. I think the challenge here for the leaders of the nra and the leadership of the gun movement if that is right is that 74% of nra members, over 80% of gun owners recognize that we have a challenge on the background check system and they want an inclusive background check system and want to keep these guns out of the hands of people who are dangerous. This is just common sense to mothers, fathers, parents in the united states. We had a poll out this week that over 75% of parents think we need to take stronger action to strengthen our gun laws. I think the issue here is really not one extreme versus another. It is the broad middle rising up and saying you know what, we can do something about it. After newtown, the idea that we do nothing is a tragedy. 

[00:06:36]


>> Chris: Let's look at some of the ideas and he is pretty open about them that vice president is suggesting and probably will offer to the president on tuesday. New limits on assault weapons. New limits on high capacity magazines that hold 30 rounds, maybe even 100 rounds. Universal background checks and a crackdown on gun trafficking. Which of those that i specifically mentioned do you think would do the most good in terms of solving the problem and which do you think is most likely to get through congress? 
>> Well, universal background checks is really important. Right now, 40% of guns sold in the united states don't have any check system. That is more than swiss cheese full of holes. You know, we really need to address that challenge. And those are area where again gun owners is support a come comprehensive gun check system. An area where hopefully this will be bipartisan support. Once the president engages in a conversation with the american people he has shown time and time again when the american people get engaged that is how you change, washington. 
>> Chris: Let's pick up on that. You and the nra and the other gun rights group say the problem isn't the weapon, it is the person who is firing the weapon. Let's talk about universal background checks. I was is surprised to find out that in 40% of the sales there is no such screen of the person buying the gun. What is wrong with universal background checks? 
>> I think it is a false security to think that somehow we will spot problems when there is really no way to spot the problems. Some of the most horrendous of the mass murders that occurred recently including one in newtown would not have been stopped by a background check. The gun is stolen. The person has no prior criminal record. And so to assume this is going to be our firewall against mass murders. 
>> Chris: I don't think anybody is saying it as firewall. What is wrong with the idea if you are going to get a gun whether it from a registered dealer or in a private sale you would have to go through a background check just in case to find out whether somebody is a felon or has a mental health problem. 

[00:08:47]


>> We are wasting our timing. 
>> That direction when we should be talking about doing away with the gun-free zones which have been such a magnet to those who would come and slaughter lots of people knowing that there is nobody that is going to be legally able to defend themselves in these zones. That is where we are really maur big mistake. 
>> Chris: Let me pick up on that. Because even barbara boxer and I say even, a very liberal progun control senator from california. Even she is talking about $50 million for federal funding of putting more police and more armed security in schools. 
>> Look, we have had situations where people are armed. We have had situations with columbine, other places where there are armed guards and it hasn't protected people. So here is the issue -- 
>> Chris: Aren't you doing the same thing that mr. Pratt did. Wait, let me just say, mr. Pratt just said it wouldn't have helped in this case. Maybe it wouldn't have helped in columbine but it might have helped in another case. 
>> You're right. I'm willing to consider those actions and I am hoping that larry pratt is willing to consider having what the police officers and law enforcement want is a background check system. I think it is wrong that it hasn't mattered and wouldn't matter. The virginia tech shooting they had a faulty background check system. He should not the have had a gun because he had problems with mental illness and yet our faulty system allowd that to happen. People would be protected today and alive today if we had these kinds of things in place. 
>> Chris: Joe biden indicated in addition to the legislative action he will suggest to the president that the president can also take executive action but not on the big things like banning guns or universal background checks. What kinds of things do you believe esident can do on an executive action basis, unilateral basis that can make a difference? 
>> Start by ensuring that the federal government, people within the federal government turn over their records also to the background check system. So the defense department needs to do that. 

[00:10:50]


>> Chris: So more information sharing? 
>> More information sharing within the government. 
>> Chris: Do you have a problem with that kind of executive action? 
>> I think we are just avoiding the reality we have been moving in the direction that somehow self-defense is not valid and that we can somehow protect ourselves by this background check idea he and in fact background checks wouldn't have stopped most of the last of these ms. Murders that have occurred. The gun gets stolen or the person has no background that would have popped up. We have got to face the reality that we have got to empower average people including teachers and other people in schools to be able to defend themselves. 
>> Chris: I want to get into one last issue, a bigger issue. You say maybe the basic problem here president obama's disdain for the constitutional right to bear arms and in fact you have compared him to george iii the british monarch during the revolution. 
>> Might he learn from his example. 
>> Chris: But when the supreme court ruled on the second amendment in the 2008 case, the case here in d.C., I want to put up with justice scalia said. There seems to us no doubt on the basis of text in history that the second amendment conferred an individual right to bear arms. Of course, the right was not unlimited. In fact, in his decision he talked about restrictions on what kinds of guns can be sold and who can buy them and where they can be carried. So yes, he said there is a second amendment individual right but he didn't say it is without limits. 
>> Well, that was unfortunate because the amendment does provide its own degree of scrutiny and says shall not be in flinged and we know that at least one justice mr. Thomas takes that point of view. This is not something where the government is supposed to be free to tell we the people the government's boss how much, how far we can go with the second amendment. The second amendment is there to constrain the government, not the people. 

[00:12:56]


>> Chris: You you think scalia was wrong when said that that right was not unlimited? 
>> He was not speaking from a constitutional perspective. 
>> He is a supreme court justice. 
>> Chris: You disagree with supreme court justices all the time. 
>> I do. But I'm surprised that he is disagreeing with justice scalia on this issue. 
>> Chris: You talked at the beginning about presidential leadership and you worked in the obama white house for a year or so. The president has too deal with the debt ceiling. He wants to pass major immigration reform. 
>> Absolutely. 
>> Chris: Do something about climate change. Has he told you how much political capital he is willing to spend on what is going to be a very tough fight? 
>> I think that the president has demonstrated tremendous leadership on this issue. I think the country rallied around him and h his leadership because he really was a voice for the parents who lost a child. 
>> Chris: Has he told you how much -- 
>> and I see from his actions and we hear from the white house and we hear from the vice president that they are going to lay down political capital on the issue and I think the one thing I would say to those people like larry and others who said we can't do anything about these issues is that whether it comes from the background checks or dealing with high capacity magazines which was the issue in newtown we can take action and to say that we should do nothing really doesn't respond to those parents in newtown who lost children in this horrible tragedy. 
>> Chris: Thank you both so much for coming in today and we will stay on top of what is likely to be one of the first tough contentious issues in the new congress. Thank you both very much. 
>> Thank you, chris. 
>> Chris: Up next, two key senators on ] HI, I'M Ensure Clear... Clear, HUH? I'm not juice or fancy water. I've gotine grams of protein. That's three times more than me!

>> Chris: President obama has announced that a national security team he wants for his is second term and bruising confirmation battles are shg up over several picks especially former senator chuck hagel for secretary of defense. Joining me are two key members of the senate armed services committee. Republican kelly ayotte and senator blumenthal. Welcome back to "fox news sunday." 

[00:18:23]


>> Thank you. 
>> Chris: I want to pick up on the conversation we had in the last session about guns. Senator ayotte you have an a rating from the nra and senator blumenthal an f rating from the nra. When you look at the ideas that vice president bide season talking -- biden is talking about and going to is present to the president on tuesday. I want to ask what you can support. Senator ayotte, can you support the idea of universal background checks? 
>> I think it would be important that we have a thoughtful discussion about this. We haven't talked I didn't hear a lot of discussion this morning with your prior guests about also our mental health system. My background before serving in the senate I was a homicide prosecutor. I do come from the perspective that taking away the rights of law abiding citizens is not going to stop a deranged individual or a criminal. Should we look at improving our background system? I'm willing to listen to what proposals come forward on that. Again, I don't know that that would have stopped what happened in newtown and I think we need to be very thoughtful in how we go forward with what happens and make sure that whatever is done actually is a solution to the problem. 
>> Chris: Senator blumenthal, you you, of course, represent newtown, connecticut, the scene of the horrific school shooting. Would the strength of the gun lobby which we demonstrated in the last seth. What are the chances -- in the last segment. What are the chances that the biden plan can get through congress? 
>> Not only do I represent the state of connecticut and newtown, chris but I really lived through that very searing painful grief in the weeks afterward speaking with families and with the newtown community and any one who lived through that period of time has been changed. And I think the nation has been transformed in the debate and the discussion and conversations we are having about gun violence prevention now. I think the nation is ready for more thorough background checks so that we cover the 40% that now are not covered. I think the nation is ready for a ban on assault weapons and high capacity magazines and most important, chris, I think e is common ground here in the need for better enforcement of the existing laws. Let me give you one very, very important example. We have no background checks now on purchases of ammunition. It is against the law for a fugitive, a felon, a deranged person, someone seriously mentally ill, someone under a court order for domestic violence abuse to purchase ammunition and firearms but there are no background checks on persons with ammunition. So someone can walk into a wal-mart and buy a shopping full of ammunition and walk out and pay no questions asked. I have proposed that we have background checks not only on firearms purchases but also ammunition and prohibit the teflon tipped and incendiary bullets. The bullets along with the firearms are what we need to focus on. And my background also is law enforcement. I was attorney general -- 

[00:21:40]


>> Chris: I do want to get to national security. You are both members of the senate armed services committee which will be holding the hearings on chuck hagel as new defense secretary. Look at the issues critics have raised. On iran he voted against sanctions. Opposed naming the revolutionary guards as terrorists because he says president bush might have used that as cover for a military attack on israel. Hagel said the u.S. Is should talk to hamas. He opposed declaring hezbollah a terrorist organization and also said this is the quote the jewish lobby intimidates a lot of people up here. Senator ayotte, how troubled are you by the hagel nomination? 
>> Let me say this I'm very he troubled. I think that the hearings on this nomination are going to be consequential. I have not made up my mind but here s where we are. You put up his prior positions. It makes me wonder and perplexes me why theesident nominated senator hagel. One of the things that troubles me that you didn't put up s also the reaction of iran. One of the greatest threats that we face is that iran acquiring a nuclear weapon. Some of the prior statements seem to suggest that he thinks we could contain iran. Well, that is against 99 senators we recently voted and richard blumenthal is a great supporter of that that our policy cannot be to contain a nuclear armed iran. Iran this week kind ofacted favorably some what. Some statements favorable to the nomination. They said they were hopeful that with his nomination they hoped that we would change our policies. What I want to make sure is that iran is actually not hopeful but they are fearful as a result of our nominee from a secretary of defense perspective because I think that will cause them to stop marching toward acquiring a nuclear weapon, not hope that we will change our policies. They he need to change their policies. 
>> Chris: Fair to say you are leaning against a nomination at this point? 
>> Fair to say if you look at his prior positions he has a lot of questions to answer about this and I'm deeply troubled by it. I guess I also wonder what message are we sending to iran and what message are we sending to israel and I'm perplexed that the president has nominated him given the statements that he made during the presidential campaign. 

[00:24:00]


>> Chris: Nascar blumenthal, simple question. Comfortable with with the positions on iran and israel? st. 
>> I will ask questions about the positions. 
>> Chris: Comfortable with them? 
>> I'm not comfortable yet. I want to ask him questions about those two issues. But two points have to be stressed. Number one, chuck hagel is someone of statue. He is is a war hero. A combat veteran. A person of enormous personal distinction in his record of public service in the senate but also in uniform. And second, you know, there are tremendously consequential issues that are equally important to ask about during this hearing. Fo shift of focus to the asia pacific. Are we going to have the underwater capability and air superiority to defend our strategy in that part of the world. Sub marines, the joint strike fighter tremendously important to our future. I want to ask senator hagel about his position on those issues. I think we have reached a point in this country where positions are taken on nominees very dramatic and staunch positions before they have the opportunity to give their own positions. 
>> Chris: To make it it clear, you are not, this is a democratic president naming his -- you are at this point not prepared to say you survivors you port the hagel nomination. 
>> I think senator hagel will be approved. The think the history of nominees shows and I think his own qualifications also demonstrate that he has the capacity but I want to know his positions on those issues and i reserve dgment until I hear his responses. 
>> Chris: I want to get to broaden this up the bigger issue with all of the president's national security picks it seems to me, senator ayotte is he seems to have come down firmly on the side of pursuing a light footprint strategy in his second term, ending the wars we are in, limiting new interventions and relying more on drones and commando special operations forces as well as multilateral action. As you look at that, are you you comfortable with that as a foreign policy approach? 

[00:26:13]


>> Well, I'm concerned, chris, about what this says and let's step back for a minute. Exhibiting a light footprint what happened in the consulate in benghazi. The fact that security was not what it should have been there. The fact that we relied on local militias that there was a rise of activity by al-qaeda inspired militias in the area and a we didn't have the proper security there and during the attack didn't have the response within the 7 hour period that we needed to obviously save lives. Let's step back further from that. What we have seen is a pattern from the president on numerous occasions where none of us want to is send men and women to war if we don't have to. And obviously we want to bring them home as quickly as possible but example a another example, iraq. We had -- he had the recommendations of his general, general austin, 15 to 18,000 troops as a followon and then it was peared down to 000. They couldn't negotiate a status of forces agreement and now you have al-qaeda coming, we have the al-qaeda activity in iraq and as well as iran playing a greater role. We are seeing the same thing in afghanistan right now. The problem is that the light footprint if you don't leave the proper follow-on in afghanistan and we have seen a pattern of where he wants to withdraw remember during the fighting season, during the election is season when no military commander recommended it. We are seeing the same thing now with the recent discussions with president karzai and the worry is that the light footprint approach can leave us in a situation where the taliban come back in power, where al-qaeda is give and launching pad to commit attacks against our country. I am concerned about this approach. 
>> Chris: And senator blumenthal generally speaking light footprint, less boots on the ground, less intervention, more drones, small commando operations, multilateral operations. 

[00:28:13]


>> A lean agile very effective special operations force is america ms future in many parts of the world in fighting terrorism. And the special operations and seals and drones together in terms of intelligence gathering as well as effective fighting force can be tremendously effective. I think what we need to do, chris, is define the mission. And that will in turn determine the size of the footprint. For example in afghanistan counter terrorism fighting special operations as well as training will require some footprint on the ground. The question is how many. And I think kelly ayotte is absolutely right to be focused on these issues. By the way, we have worked together on a very bipartisan way. SHE AND senator McCain and senator graham and myself and senator casey on iran. 
>> I have great reis spect for richard on these issues. 
>> As members of the armed is services committee we will continue working together because there s no republican or democratic approach to national security. This out to be one approach. 
>> Chris: We have to leave it there. Thank you both for coming in today. Always good to talk with both of. 
>> Thank you, chris. 
>> Chris: Up next, we ask our sunday group about the president's light footprint policy and the national security team he's chose ton ke it work. 
-- Chosen to make it work. ] day news starts with arthritis pain and a choice. Take tylenol or take aleve, the #1 recommended pain reliever by orthopedic doctors. Just two aleve can keep pain away all day. Back to the news. 

[00:32:24]


>>> With the devastating blows we have struck against al-qaeda our core objective, the reason we went to war in the first place is now within reach. Ensureing that al-qaeda can never again use afghanistan to launch attacks against our country. 
>> Chris: President obama this week announcing a faster time table forgetting out of afghanistan. And it is time for our sunday group. Brit hume, fox news senior political analyst. Bob woodward of the washington post and author of the book the price of politics. Bill kristol of the weekly standard and former democratic senator evan bayh. The president made it clear this week if it is not a rush for the eastboundities in afghanistan it is -- exits in afghanistan it is a brisk walk in that direction, brit. He sped up the time table for moving from a lead combat role to an advisory mission and all signs are he will commit fewer troops to afghanistan after 2014 than u.S. Commanders want. Question, or two questions. What do you make of that and what do you make of all this talk as we discuss with the two senators about pursuing a light footprint foreign policy in the second term? 
>> I hope the president is right. I hope we are near the moment where as he suggests where we can say mission accomplished in afghanistan and al-qaeda can never run free here again and use afghanistan as a base for operations. The fear, of course, is that he is not right and that the force that he leaves behind and the mission assigned will not be sufficient to further that goal and then you -- that, of course, is a question of his nominee for defense and whether that nominee for defense if he were to listen to the commanders and begin to think that their case was more powerful would be willing to sell the president so and the president would be willing to listen to him. 
>> Chris: We will get to haig until a minute but afghanistan and the whole idea of light footprint. 
>> He believes in it. I did a whole book obama's wars on his afghan policy and president obama is the one who added 30,000 troops initially in 2009. A surge much bigger than george w. Bush's surge in iraq. They looked at it and they think we can get out. Remember it as new world now. We are kind of in a post -- the transition out of a post super power world. And obama and his team are trying to find a way to adapt to that and I think getting out of afghanistan makes sense. The question is you need some sort of insurance policy and that would be some sort of troops left behind, what that number is, is up in the air obviously. 

[00:35:04]


>> Chris: As one of the founding members of neoconservative movement, bill, who you make of all this? 
>> Well, bob said, getting out of afghanistan. That s what president obama wants to do and I think it is deeply iris responsible but i think it will be very hard for the senate or the house to stop him from doing so and I don't think it will work to leave a couple of thousand troops there. No serious analyst thinks you can maintain or even support counter terrorism operations. Can't even support special forces or drones with two or three or four thousand troops. They will be defending themselves. The cia is now going to pull back rapidly and dramatically in afghanistan. They need protection, too. President obama will take us down below a level at which i think we can function there. It is a dangerous policy and i hope the congress looks at that time and we have a debate on it and I hope president obama explains to the american people what he is doing. If he decided the game isn't worth the candle, he should say that and explain why he ordered the surge that bob mentioned three years ago and now and we sent an awful lot of kids over there and why he is now just getting out. 
>> Chris: You talked about congress. Let me flip to the other subject. In comes as the president named a new national security team and as I discussed with the senators the most controversial pick is chuck hagel for defense secretary. Here is what hagel said this week when was named. 
>> I will do my best for our country and for those i represent at the pentagon and for all of our citizens. And mr. President, I will always give you my honest and most informed counsel. 
>> Chris: The question, bill, is what kind of counsel hagel will give. We talked with the senators about his positions on israel and iran and what we didn't mention s that he also said that he thinks the pentagon budget is bloated and needs to be pared down? 
>> The comment was to leon panetta's comment that this would be devastating cuts. He is very worried about the cuts. Chuck hagel dismissed any problems and said the pentagon budget is bloated. Downtown think chuck hagel is the right man to be secretary of defense. We will see if they agree with that. 

[00:37:25]


>> Chris: Your thoughts about him as secretary of defense? 
>> I think what s important here, chris, to remember is it is not what kristol or bayh might want in a secretary of defense. It is what president obama wants. Regardless of who the secretary of defense is they are going to have to recognize certain economic and fiscal realities and part of that s going to be trimming the pentagon budget. So personally, he served our country. Wounded if combat. Nothing personally disqualifying there and I think the hearings and personal meetings will give senator hagel -- 
>> Chris: Are you troubled when you heard the statements he made on iran and israel? 
>> I have differences of opinions on these issues. But the important thing is he has the president's trust and represents the president's thinking and his critics will have an opportunity to ask him about his views about israel and about how we deal with iran. I think you will find senator hagel will be he clear and strong in his support and israel and lay out a strategy for dealing with the iranian nuclear program. That is what is important going forward. 
>> With all due respect I don't think the most important thing is whether he has the president's trust. I think it is obvious and he wouldn't have been chosen if he hadn't. The thing is whether he can make the right decisions at a time of austerity but must be done expertly and well and shrewdly so that we do not diminish the strength of our military. The president keeps talking about it remains the most powerful fighting force in history. That will not end up that way if the job of paring back pentagon spending don't done deftly. Senator hagel has never been really a defense intellectual and so forth. His judgment is the key and it is the most important thing. 
>> It is not disqualifying to have not been a defense intellectual. I think what -- that hagel served in vietnam as an enlisted sergeant. S a tribute to him and obama that they would pick somebody like this. I served in the navy during the vietnam era and I remember that and I lessons of vietnam really are embedded in those who were there and I think that s really good and I think the issue really is when are we going to go to war, how are we going to use military force. And what obama and hagel i think are saying here is we are going to be very restrained. But I think they both realize and I found in doing this book on obama he is willing to use force. There is no question about that. But it is with a a lot of caution restraint and let's face it, obama is not going to bring back don rumsfeld for a third term as secretary of defense. 

[00:40:23]


>> Restraint is always a good thing in the application of military force. What you want to have, though, is restraint by choice and not because you must be restrained because you lack the force necessary for certain missions. That is the question are we being restrain the because we have to or because we decide to? 
>> The important thing to remember, chris, s we are not going to have a secretary of defense free lansing making the decisions on his or other own. Most of the judgments made in the white house and implemented by the secretary of defense and so it really is the president who is ultimately accountable for all this and his views were judged in november and that was decided and now he has an opportunity to implement those policies and we can judge them accordingly. 
>> Chris: We have to take a break here. When we come back, the politics of gun control as president obama talks tough heading into his second term. ] time drop? Campbell's has 24 new soups that will make it drop over, and over again. ?????? ?????? from jammin' jerk chicken, to creamy gouda bisque. See what's new from campbell's. It's amazing what soup can do. ???????????? Using robotics and mobile technology, Verizon innovators have made it possible for teachers to teach, and for a kid... Nathan. Tadpole. ... to feel like a kid again. Because the world's biggest challenges deserve even bigger solutions. Powerful answers. Verizon. ?? 

[00:44:35]


>>> I think we can do a great deal without in any way imposing on or impinging on the rights of the second amendment. Clear they weren't looking to hear from gun owners. They were looking to blame gun other thans. 
>> Chris: The vice president and the nra on the gun controls the vice president will send to the panel this week. The president is looking to for more gun control in the wake of newtown. Do you see any sign and you heard the conversation today, of a new willingness on congress to pass this kind of legislation? 
>> Not much. They might -- I will assume they will consider various measures but ultimately the measures are not going to do much about unfortunately the mass kicks we had. The president didn't campaign on gun control. Second term presidents do well when they try to implement what they told the voters they would focus on. He was going to focus on the economy. He didn't talk about gun control when controlled congress in 2009 and 2010 they didn't reinstate the assault ban. 
>> Chris: But we did have newtown. 
>> We did have newtown but one incident does not tell you what policy should be and in any case as everyone pointed out a million times the particular things proposed would have is nothing to do with newtown. Hot a single proposal on their menu that would have stopped mr. Lanza from buying the guns and having the guns apparently. There would have been a registry in which people would have known she had the gun. Would that have helped? 
>> Chris: I was astonished to learn during the 2012 campaign the nra contributed $20 million to various candidates and the gun control groups $4,000 and that more than 50% of the people on capitol hill have an a rating from the nra. Do you see any movement on this issue? 

[00:46:36]


>> It is a very difficult heavy lift, chris. You think back to when bill clinton tried this in 1993. He had a large major etan of democrats in the -- majority in the house of representatives and was barely able to get anything done and now, of course, the republicans control the house of representatives. And you put your finger on it the opponents of taking additional steps tend to be much better organized and better funded. My guess is most of the action in the regulatory arena and the administration will look to see what they can do on their own absent much prospect for legislation. 
>> Chris: I want to broad then legislation. Whether it is the fiscal cliff or gun control or a major immigration reform movement by the president. He seems to be as he prepares for his inaugural a more combative president, more confrontational and less interested even in the beginning in compromise. One, do you agree? And two, what does that say to you about prospects for his second term? 
>> I think it is interesting because the president was elected in '08 by a more significant margin, notably more significant margin than he was reelected. He was not nearly the in your face guy in '09 and 2010 with the exception of obama care obviously which the public turned out not to like and the stimulous, he didn't really have this level of -- and his level of intensity about things and his supporters were insisting throughout he s really a moderate. He is a really a moderate. But he doesn't look like a moderate now having lost the house of representatives, republicans hold in the 2012 election the house. He is in a less strong position than he was in '08 and 2009 and yet coming on more aggressively. One wonders if it will end well for him. 

[00:48:40]


>> An interesting question going on is what is the role for the republican house in divided government and what is obama's role? And they are going to have is to face that and the republicans I think today and tomorrow they are having a leadership retreat and the end of the week all house republicans are meeting and they have got to define what is that role and hopefully gun control connects to immigration, connects to all of the spending and tax issues and are they going to have some way where they are going to say let's work together or are we going to have four more years of this petty stupid fighting on things that makes everyone look ridiculous and no one comes out the winner. 
>> Chris: Let me before I get to you, and what about the president's side of it? Do you agree that h has take and more combative tone since the election? 
>> He has. But, you know, we were going to have tax increases for everyone and he and to speaker boehner's credit they wound up agreeing as did biden and mcconnell that we are going to give 99% of the people in this country a permanent tax break. That was a big accomplishment. Of course, everyone dumped on it when it happened but the 99% of the people who got that tax cut I think are quite happy. I think they haven't figured out a strategy in the white house just like the republicans don't have one. 
>> There is two kinds of issues. Issues the president ran on in the reelection campaign. He has credibility to say hey, I won the reelection. You can say to democratic members of eongress this is our platform and to republican members say don't you need to compromise with me on this and that was taxes and exclusively on raising taxes on the wealthy. 
>> He ran on immigration reform. 
>> And immigration reform. On the two issues already on taxes there s a good chance of holding good chunks of his party and of persuading republicans let's try to work something out on this. He didn't run on gun control. If I can get back to hagel he ran as extremely proisrael and tough on proiran sanctions guy and now nominated a defense secretary who is not onboard with that so republicans feel no compunction about opposing senator hagel. 

[00:51:03]


>> You are -- 
>> there is questions about it and he said some things but i think if he were here and i think in his confirmation hearings he is going to be very proisrael. And pro -- 
>> he didn't mean it when said that his fellow senators were intimidated by the jewish lobby. 
>> That was years ago. He has apologized. 
>> Chris: Let me broaden this out even more. That is if you look over recent history whether it is regan, whether it is clinton, whether it is bus 43, second term presidents tend to have problems. One, why do you think that is in their second terms and what do you think that there is a -- do you see any warning signs that president obama may be falling into some of the same traps? 
>> It reminds me when I first became governor chris and was confronted with a difficult issue I had never heard of and I looked at the chief of staff and said you know most of the easy decisions were made before we got here. You have more political capital to use in the first term. It as depreciating asset in the second term. That is one of the reasons the president s being so more aggressive now. Number one the political decisions and core philosophical differences between the two parties now are greater than I can ever remember. That maybes compromise more difficult. The fiscal and economic challenge I think is going to use mo most of the legislative capital. A lot of the action in the next couple of years in the regulatory area, consolidating the affordable care and dodd frank. I'm glad you are all sitting down. In a matter of months minds turn to the mid term elections. Thing if the democrats get the house free running again. 
>> Chris: You were saying you wonder whether this is going to end well. Do you worry or do you have concerns -- 
>> not this. The fiscal negotiations and our spending and taxes, the taxes one I think is closed, come down to this. The reason we can't get a deal is that for each party each party s trying to get from the negotiations what they are being asked to five up in the negotiations. 

[00:53:16]


-- Give up in the negotiations. Hard to get a deal that a way.

The f 
>> Referee:12 men on defense. Half the distance to the goal. 
>> Brian: Wow. 
>> Thom: So that takes it fromide the 4 to just outside the 1. Look at these numbers for wilson. His team shut out in the first half. 378 passing yards. A postseason seahawk franchise record. And now with 34 seconds left trying to get to the end zone. 
>> Brian: He has yet to get into the read option and keep the ball. This would be a heck of a place to do it. 
>> Thom: They just give it to lynch, who fumbled the ball but then it's picked up by urng. 
-- Unger for a seattle touchdown! And now the officials are conversing over this. They will gather. At the 1 yard line. Boy, marshawn lynch, was he already in before the ball was jarred loose on the hit by william moore, eventually landing in the arms of unger 
>> Brian: I'm not sure that ball crossed the plane before it started to move. 
>> Thom: Of course either way, seattle gets the ball. 
>> Brian: There's a whole bunch of difference between a touchdown and seattle having to do it again. Right there, I don't know if we see the ball coming out before it crosses the plane. 
>> Thom: And when it lands like it did, you ask yourself is seattle indeed the team of destiny in this 2012-13 postseason. ?????? ??????

[00:03:19]


>> Thom: Mike pereira, this was a rule they put in after the dave casper fumble many years ago. Tell us what's going on here? 
>> Remember, inside of 2:00, only the fumbling player can recover a football in front of the fumble spot. So if they rule this a fumble, they would have to go back and give seattle the ball at the spot of the fumble. Personally, I think the ball broke the plane before it knocked loose. 
>> Thom: So walt coleman with the verdict. 
>> Referee: After reviewing the play, the ruling on the field is confirmed. The ball broke the plane of the goal line prior to coming loose, so touchdown. 
>> Thom: So it was a touchdown for marshawn lynch. And that pretty much tells you the overwhelming feeling here in atlanta. A point after to give seattle the lead. Ryan longwell just brought in this week after the injury to steven hauschka has not really been a factor at all. Has not attempted a field goal in the game. But now the point after from a kid who grew up rooting for the seahawks as a kid in seattle. And it's good. Stunned disbelief here in atlanta. The seahawks lead by one. 
>> Thom:31 seconds left, 28-27 seattle. No one, starting with mike smith, could have seen this coming, up by 20. 

[00:05:24]


>> Brian: Well, for seattle to respond emotionally, let alone the execution on the field, after what happened in the first h we talked forever about going west coast to east coast for the washington game, having too back, coming to the east coast again for the atlanta game. You could have understood seattle not having the energy to finish this off, but right now kudos to the seattle seahawks for fighting back and taking a one-point lead. 
>> Thom: Of course atlanta has two time-outs left and here's jacquizz rodgers. He's got across the 15 to the 20, the 25 and out to the 37. So 27 seconds remaining. Matt ryan has two time-outs left. We saw them pull off one of their great comebacks in franchise history with under a minute two years ago against ago. Tony gonzalez, never with a playoff win. Matt ryan, 0 for 3. Likewise for mike smith. This their third straight time to the playoffs in his five years, their fourth time overall. 
>> Brian: The time-outs allow them time to go to the middle of the field should they choose. Otherwise you're looking at deep outside routes. 
>> Thom: Ryan steps up, throws and the catch is made by harry douglas, and that's to the 48 yard line. And a time-out. 
>> Brian: And this is exactly how they came back in the chicago game with a deep outside throw. I believe it was to michael jenkins before, and now they're within 15 yards of a makeable field goal with one time-out. 
>> Thom: Stay tuned, following our game coverage for the broken city postgame show. 19 seconds left. Career long for matt bryant is 62 yards. That means you'd have to get roughly to the 45 yard line. But let's be honest about it. 62, the chances are pretty slim. 
>> Brian: And I say again, with one time-out, it leaves you the option of throwing the ball in the middle of the field should you choose, rather than having to make the outside throw like we just saw. 

[00:07:33]


>> Thom: Bryant's season long is 55. Ryan finds gonzalez. Well within field goal range now. One time-out left. Ryan trying to get them to the line of scrimmage. Nope, they're going to call time-out. Leading by 20, atlanta has the lead get away from them. Seattle goes up by one with less than a minute and now matt bryant will have a chance to send atlanta to the nfc championship game. 
>> Brian: And, thom, if matt bryant makes this field goal, how much will this do for this franchise and matt ryan. We've talked about the pressure on matt ryan. If they had just kept this thing going and made it a rout, sure it would have made it a great win. How about if they can pull this off with matt ryan making two big throws to bring them back and win this game. 
>> Thom: Keep an eye on red bryant, number 79. He has five blocked field goals in his career. This one will be from 49 yards away. 
>> Brian: And he has sliced up the middle of this field goal team or p.A.T. Attempt twice already. He hasn't gotten home, but he sliced through pretty good. 
>> Thom: Josh harris the snapper. The holder is his punter, matt bosher, and time-out was called before that kick got away. Timeout was called by pete carroll. Pete carroll is looking around saying who called time-out. 
>> Brian: Somebody called time-out. Again, a veteran kicker will tell you if you're going to let me get the kick off, thank you. Because you just gave me a mulligan. You just gave me a chance to size it up. You want to get that thing called so they don't actually get it snapped and kicked. Right now pete is wondering who called the time-out? 

[00:09:39]


>> Thom: Well, I don't know, it looks pretty straightforward there unless he whispered I'm not calling a time-out. Forget it. 
>> Thom: Here we go again. 13 seconds left. 49 yards away for matt bryant. From the right hash. Good snap, good hold and it is good! 
>> Brian: Wow! Folks, that -- you look at mike smith there, that's why that hair is that color. You last long enough in this league, what a comeback. What a game. And as I said, it would have been one thing to run them out of the house. But boy, I tell you what, to bring it back this way. Now, we've still got eight seconds on the board. But boy, what a sequence of events for the atlanta falcons, for matt ryan, for mike smith, arthur blank and what that will do for this franchise if they can hold on to the win. 
>> Thom:49-yarder by bryant. We had a lengthy visit with him the other day and talked with him about being cut loose by tampa bay. Went and played in the usl, hoping to get another chance. And since coming to atlanta, he's been money. You've got to give kudos to the seattle seahawks now. They could have been out of this game a dozen different times. Both these teams responding in a championship caliber way. Regrettable only one can win. 
>> Thom: But still not over. Eight seconds remain. 

[00:11:43]


>> Brian: You've got to squib this one. You don't give leon washington a chance to crank this one up. 
>> Thom: They have got doug baldwin and golden tate up in front of him. Robert bin there as well. A very short kick that is knocked down by the front line of seattle and now all of a sudden you have six seconds left. Holy mackerel. Who has the football is where we start. 
>> Brian: Wow. 
>> Thom: But now all of a sudden seattle is conceivably a pass reception away. What happened here, brian? 
>> Brian: Well, i can't imagine this was the plan, because you've got to be around the 50, the 45 to even think about drying the hail mary. Otherwise you're just out of plan. I can't believe the plan wasn't to kick that a little deeper. I said it was goi be a squib, but you want it to squib down around the 30 out of range with six seconds left to not give them a chance at this hail mary. 
>> Thom: Well, atlanta -- brian, do you not have time enough to run say a sideline route and a chance for a field goal? I mean it's only a field goal from winning. 
>> Brian: Yeah, yeah, you do, but in six seconds you're going to cut it awfully close and atlanta recognizes anything in the middle of the field, it's done. You've got no chance of coming up and running a play. 
>> Thom: They have got julio jones all the way back, and they complete a pass and out of bounds with two seconds left is baldwin. That would still be, what, a 65-yard field goal try for longwell. His career long is 55. They needed to get more yardage than that if that was their only shot before a field goal. 
>> Brian: This makes it a little easier to take a shot at a hail mary. You know what the odds of that are, but of course this team has lived it on the reverse side of it. Wow. 

[00:13:47]


>> Thom: The miracle win over green bay during the regular season. Now the throw to the end zone. It's intercepted by julio jones and the atlanta falcons will play in the nfc championship game for the first time since 2004. And for mike smith, matt ryan, tony gonzalez, collectively, individually, their first postseason win. 
>> Brian: And that win, this win right here, legitimizes the seattle seahawks as the number one seed and makes them the team to beat. 
>> Thom: Let's go downstairs to laura. 
>> Laura: Thanks, thom. All right, tt ryan, for almost four years you've had to answer the question what is it like to never win a playoff game. How much better do you feel right now with that monkey off of your back? 
>> I feel good. That was a wild game, it really was. Russell wilson played unbelievable. He played so hard. Our guys, we just didn't quit. We just kept playing and made some plays on that last drive. 
>> Laura: We talk so much about the pressure that came out of the last playoff losses. What came out of it good that you took today. 
>> I think everybody has a thicker skin. Today we got out to an early lead. They battled back and we just kept fighting and found a way to win. 
>> Laura: How long do you celebrate and then turn your attention to san francisco's defense?

>> CuAS WE WELCOME YOU BACK To the broken city postgame show, atlanta a happy city right now. So is tony gonzalez. 16 years in the nfl and gets his first playoff win in thrilling fashion. Let's send it back to atlanta where laura okmin is standing by with gonzalez. 
>> Laura: Tony gonzalez after watching you for 16 years, I've never seen you more emotional than watching that last drive, thinking that you were about to win your first playoff game. What was going through your mind? 
>> After 16 years and never winning a pla game, I've never cried after a win. I mean I was thinking, oh, here it goes again. I guess it just wasn't meant to be. But for us to come back the way we did, I'm so proud of our guys. Everybody stepped up when we had to and made the plays. Hats off to the team the way they fought back. You knew they were going to make a run, but I'm just so happy right now, I can't even explain it. 

[00:25:07]


>> Laura: We talked so much about the negatives and the pressure that came with the last three playoff losses. What were the positives that you guys used today to withstand that rally? 
>> I can't even think about the positives. Obviously we've been here before and everybody knew that. We had a great week of practice, we came out and played our tails off. But we can't let them back in the game like that. They're a good football team. This is playoff football at its best. I'm just so happy the way we fought down there. I'd be lying if I tell you i thought we weren't going to be able to pull that one out, but I'm so glad we did. 
>> Laura: Were you thinking at any time this was going to be my last game if you didn't that off? 
>> Yep, yep. I thought I guess this is going to be it, going out with a heart-breaking loss. But I was thinking it's not fair but I'm so glad I don't have to worry about that now because we won. 
>> Laura: Tony gonzalez going to the nfc championship game. 
>> Nfc championship game, I love it. 
>> Curt: One of the good guys in the nfl. Not only the joy because he won a playoff game but the way that he won it. After blowing that 20-0 lead and thinking they were going to be on the losing ending, literally atlanta put the ball in their leaders' hands to set up that field goal. 
>> Howie: How appropriately. It's matt ryan's seventh game-winning drive this season including the playoffs. How appropriately to get his first playoff win and tony gonzalez' first playoff win in 16 years in professional football. They put the ball in his hands to set up the big kick. You go back to seattle and russell wilson, which I think will be as much a part of the conversation, the performance he put on, coming from behind. They looked like a team that woke up at 4:00 a.M., Was hitting people at 10:00 a.M. Out on the west coast. Took about a quarter to wake up. 
>> Jimmy: You've got to feel good for mike smith, coach of atlanta. The pressure was on him, the city, everybody saying can you win the big one, can you win a playoff ball game. This seattle team, I knew it was a tough matchup from the very start. Seattle played outstanding. They're going to be a great team for years to come. But this atlanta team, they did whatever it took to win the ball game. They'll be ready to host san francisco coming in next week. 

[00:27:17]


>> Terry: For all our viewers, though, how many of you out there were saying we're going to squib kick this thing. How about a little more than ten yards. I don't think that was what matt bryant meant to do. They meant to get it down there, but a great football game. Once again, seattle coming back like they did against the washington redskins, I mean awfully impressive. NOW YOU LOOK AND SAY 49ers TO Atlanta and I would say right NOW 49ers WOULD HAVE TO BE A Heavily favored football team in game. 
>> Curt: The one thing we know we don't have to hear about, the falcons not winning a playoff game with matt ryan and mike smith. They get the victory 30-28. They will host the nfc championship game next sunday so that brings us to our subway fresh take. Michael, how do you think the falcons will hold up against the niners? 
>> Michael: If the falcons can run the ball and take some pressure off matt ryan, that's really going to help. On the defensive side, if they had trouble containing russell wilson, they're really going to have trouble containing kaepernick because he's a lot more of a threat against the run. 
>> Curt: We'll talk a lot more about next week's game but more on this week's game. The great victory by the atlanta falcons and a great game by the seseahawks. We'll continue with the broken city postgame.1942.

=======================================================

>> This is the fox report, movement to tell you about tonight. In the debate over gun control. As we wait to hear what the white house will do next, we know we're just about 48 hours away from the big reveal of what a task force recommends. Question, will the president listen to the recommendations? What could a new gun law look like? We're starting to hear new predictions from people to power and close to the issues. 
>> But I would say that the likelihood is that they're not going to be able to get an assault weapons ban here. 
>> I think the nation's ready for a ban on assault weapons. 
>> Harris: Armed with fighting words as the showdown with the right to freedom to bear arms. Ap what's inside the gun control debate? And going after cyber terrorists based overseas. The latest trend to protect companies here at home from being robbed of their best ideas and innovations. Also, this is probably not the reaction the kremlin expected when it recently banned americans from adopting children. Now, russians in the streets of moscow with a message for president putin. I'm harris falkner, we begin tonight with the constitution, and our second amendment rights, which were front and center on this sunday. Our elected leaders, crisscrossing the talk shows, the nation's gun lobby and n.R.A. Expressing confidence that an assault weapons ban already being talked about in washington will not make it through congress. The n.R.A. Is standing by over concerns of a meeting with vice-president joe biden saying the obama administration needs to stop focusing solely on guns and gun owners. 

[00:02:05]


>> We wish instead of talking about guns specifically, that they would have addressed what will we do in the future. What will we do about a broken mental health system that allows people potentially violent to be on the streets? 
>> And a liberal think tank weighing in for the first time shall the center for american progress announcing it's joining a full scale campaign to push for more gun control laws. 
>> The organizations will be working to work in the states, and ensure at that we have the voice and really have the american people and really gun owners who listen to the proposals, their voices at the table as well. 
>> Harris: All of this in the wake of a week long series of meetings hosted by the vice-president as he puts together a plan to curb violence, he says. We expect that plan to be officially presented to the white house on tuesday. Our peter doocy with the news live for us in washington. And peter, after all of this task force and that information coming together. Do you have any indication that republicans and democrats are finding common ground on gun control? 
>> Harris, both sides said they think it would be wise to figure out some way to prevent the sale of firearms and ammunition to people who are known to be mentally ill and dangerous, but actually implementing that idea has already been a source of intense debate and so has talks about enhancing background checks. 
>> Should we look at improving our background check system? I'm willing to listen to what proposals come forward on that, but again, I don't know that that would stop what happened in newtown and i think we need to be very thoughtful in how we go forward with what happens and make sure that whatever is done actually is a solution to the problem. 
>> Former mississippi governor haley barber summarized the general republican argument against strict gun control this morning, on meet the press, by saying simply, that if you make it a crime to have a gun, only criminals will have guns. 

[00:04:05]


>> Harris: What about all the talk about a potential bill to ban assault weapons being introduced? Where do we stand on that? 
>> Reporter: Harris, w heard this morning, that two democratic senators, dianne feinstein from california and richard blumenthal from connecticut plan to introduce that soon and freshman senator chris murphy, a democrat from connecticut who attended several funerals for sandy hook elementary students before he was sworn in said he will support that legislation and told us more about it. 
>> It's a tighter ban than the previous ban. And it will address high capacity magazines, but the fact is that as soon as we pass that ban, back in the 1990's, the gun manufacturers found a way around it and other states, like new jersey and california, have passed much stricter bans and that's what the congress needs to do. 
>> The task force, led by vice-president joe biden is not expect today release their recommendations for he reducing gun violence until tuesday, and biden said this week, president obama could use an executive order to implement some safety measures, but this morning, republican senator lindsey graham said that an executive order like that would run into bipartisan opposition in the congress. 
>> Harris? 
>> Yeah, and as sources said, peter, much like the fight we saw against an executive order or any push there about on health care in this country. Peter doocy, thank you very much. Let's continue now, gun control is just one item on what is shaping up to be, what some say a very ambitious agenda for president obama's second term. The president of course, sworn in a week from today in a private ceremony, the public inauguration a week from tomorrow, from cabinet positions to the debt ceiling, and immigration reform. Jennifer griffin takes a look at the president's agenda ahead. 
>> Harris, first there will be the confirmation battle, some will be bruising, none more so than the president's pick for defense secretary, chuck hage those hearings could start as early as this week we're told by senate sources and the white house mounted a vigorous defense and hagel says his record on israel, iran and gays in the military has been distorted and the senate armed services committee, kelly ayotte says what worries her most is the reaction from iran. 

[00:06:22]


>> What I want to make sure is that iran is actually not hopeful, but they're fearful, as r ult of our nominee from the secretary of perspective. 
>> Former chairman of joint chiefs and secretary of state colin powell gave his backing to hagel today then though then senator hagel was one of the largest critics of the iraq war, a war that powell helped sell to the american people. And hagel later tried to stop the surge in iraq, calling it the biggest foreign policy blunder since vietnam. 
>> Superbly qualified based on his overall record, based on his service to the country, based on how he feels about troops and veterans and families. 
>> Reporter: The president is gearing up for a fight on three key issues, gun control, budgetmmigration reforms. And he's like I to get with marco rubio creating a path to citizenship for the current 12 million illegal immigrants, harris. 
>> Harris: Jennifer griffin, thank you very much. Now to the ongoing fight of the flu, the centers for disease control and prevention calling it an epidemic, people taking precautions and the lines long for the clinic in massachusetts and waiting to get their flu vaccines in the boston area, and declared a public health emergency as you may know last week and in nebraska a similar scene with hundreds of people lining up to get their shots. Health officials saying it does make a difference. 
>> And every day you had a flu shot, you're better protected than the day before and you never know when you're going to, you know, cross that nasty virus and it could be a problem for you. 
>> Harris: There are a lot of other ways to be careful, so say the experts. One man in north carolina takio chances even when it comes to putting gas in his car. 
>> I never thought about the gas pumps, but everybody is touching is so I could imagine it would be pretty dirty. You know, you never know what you're getting in contact with. Everyday things you run into. 

[00:08:30]


>> Harris: Wow. Pretty soon won't be able to touch anything. The flu widespread in 47 states all except california, hawaii and mississippi at thiu point. Anna kooiman has been on the story for us from the new york city news room. What's the latest. 
>> Reporter: Harris, in years past once the flu was in the the headlines, there's often a run on flu vaccine and this year's strain. H-3 n-2 is nasty making people sicker longer. Hospitals around the country have seen spikes in flu-related admissions and death. And public health officials say some places are experiencing shortages and PATIENTS HAVING TO WAIT ON t% Shipments to come in. 
>> As of yesterday evening, 123 flu vaccine and right now, I think we have one or two left in our refrigerator. 
>> This is a sign of how bad the flu is, the epidemic right now is, you know, crazy. 
>> Reporter: But physicians are urging americans to be persistent because vaccine is available and now is the time to get the shot, according to the centers of disease control and prevention, or c.D.C., The vaccine is 62% effective in preventing flu and takes two weeks to work. And designed to not only help patients vaccinated, but fewer people are out contagious and spreading the virus around and some hospitals are telling workers they must get the flu shot and some people have lost their jobs over refusing to do so. Harris, nearly 130 million doses of flu vaccine have been distributed and so far shall at least 112 million have been used. 
>> Harris: Well, anna, you saw the gentleman at the gas station, be careful what you touch and critics have been slapping us in the media saying we're hyping the flu, but doctors say, it actually is helo get the word out and t public is responding. 
>> Right, public health officials are saying the media has helped raise awareness to the common population, to the very young, very old and those with underlying conditions are most at risk. And they also tend to visit the doctor more. And get their shots during other scheduled visits. 

[00:10:32]


>> And so, I think you can see looking around, many of the patients were coming in today, although not all of them, are younger folks who have heard on the news or seen in their community, healthy people are getting the flu and getting protected. 
>> Physicians caution everyone to wash their hands often and disinfect surfaces like computers and cell phones and easily spread on planes and trains, escalators and atm and the handle at the gas pump like we saw the man in north carolina being ever so careful about. 
>> Harris: Anna, kooiman, thank you very much. President george h.W. Bush could soon go home from the hospital. A spokesperson saying he will be able to be discharged this coming week and take it go one day at a time. After comments his son, former florida governor jeb bush made during an interview, saying he believes his dad will be released from the hospital as early as tomorrow. The former president was admitted in late november for treatment of a bronchitis related cough. Right now, new word, actually within the past hour, that our military provided limited support today to a commando raid overseas and the white house now confirming, u.S. Combat aircraft entered somalia's air space, while a european ally conducted a hostage rescue operation that did not go according to plan. We'll have more as we learn it for you tonight. And also, with our hearts still so heavy from the tragedy in newtown, connecticut, new questions facing the people of that community. What to do with the elementary school, where 20 children and six adults were murdered. Tonight, the options now being weighed. Stay close. ?????? ??????

>> Just in we're getting confirmation from the the white house shall the u.S. Assisted france in a failed hostage rescue attempt inside somalia. French special forces went in on friday to rescue a man held captives by terrorists for year. 17 terrorists and a french soldier reportedly killed, as well as the hostage. President obama telling congress in a letter that our military provided quote, limited technical support, and a number of american combat aircraft were in somalia air space for a short period of time. Meanwhile, france calling an emergency meeting of the u.N. National security council to talk about their military action again al-qaeda affiliated terrorist ins western africa, as we get reports of the u.S. Stepping in and providing the french military in that with communications, and transportation support. France, upping its military campaign in mali, hundreds of troops on the ground there as of yesterday. As french aircraft carry out air strikes, bombings, suspected terrorist camps and warehouses and islamic terror groups currently have control of a huge chunk of mali's northern territory and french leaders say action is needed to keep it from being the new hub of terror activity in north africa. New word from an airline who says their dreamliner aircraft is experienced repeated problems. Japan airlines reporting this plane had a fuel leak in boston last week, sprung another leak today. Boeing 787 dreamliner losing more than 26 gallons of fuel, during a routine pre-flight check and one of the boeing's top customers is having trouble, major trouble, fuel leak, cracked cockpit window and here in the united states, as you may know, federal regulators asked for review of design and assembly of the 200 million dollar aircraft. Well, thousands of people gathering today to mark one year since the doomed italian cruise ship, costa concordia ran aground off the the coast. It began with a memorial service off the site of the ship wreck and asking that only families of the 32 victims who died and survivors attended a catholic mass in the town where they spent the night after the rescue. And the bishop leading that mass and honoring rescue crews who spent hours evaluating more than 4,000 passengers on that sinking ship. Meanwhile, the costa concordia remains stuck where it sank, a few hundred feet off the shore. And salvage teams saying more time and money will be needed before they can move it safely. After months of falling, gasoline prices are headed right back north. The average for a gallon of regular gas now, regular unleaded in the lower 48 states shooting up 7 cents in the past three weeks, that's according to a new lundberg survey that came out today. An average of 3.32. Crude oil prices jumped in recent weeks as well. Triggering higher prices at the pump. The survey also showed people on long island and new york, shelling out the most to fill up, .75 on average there. Meanwhile, people in salt lake city utah enjoy the lowest price for it, their average, 3.04. Well, this former dictator faced a life sentence for ordering the can I go of hundreds of protesters during an uprising in cairo. Now an egyptian appeals court has overturned that ruling. That's him right there in a gurney. What could that decision mean for hosni mubarak's future? Also, an armed man runs into a movie neither. Police follow.

>> Pure chaos, they say. When police shoot an armed suspect hiding inside a crowded san diego movie theater. Police say it all started when he the suspect got into a fight with his girlfriend in the parking lot across the street. The girl's manager saw what was going on, and called 911 as the suspect took off he went into the theater. Officer eventually tracking him down after searching that multiplex room by room. A witness describing what happened as they entered. 
>> I heard two shots and i went to the floor, and then i went out of the back of the theater and we saw police running around. 
>> Witnesses say the armed suspect never threatened any movie goers. Police shot him twice in the arm and chest. Tonight, he's hospitalized. Remember the revolution in egypt to kick out their back in the headlines and the egypt ruled for a new trial for mubarak. He was virtually bedridden during the first trial last year, found guilty of failing to prevent the death of dozens of protesters, and dozens of pro mubarak supporters cheered as the announcement about a new trial was made, holding up his portrait, shouting long live justice. Connor powell tracking the developments from our mideast news room. 
>> Harris, after nearly two years of constant turmoil. Egyptian politics have taken another strange turn. Just last june, the 84-year-old former president and chief of security were convicted of failing to prevent the killing of hundreds of protesters and today that conviction has been overturned. There were loud cries of joy in the courtroom as the judge issued the acquittal. Mubarak supporters celebrated the ruling both inside the courtroom and outside the building, shouting long live justice. Defense lawyers argue that mubarak didn't know about the killings. The judge agreed, both men will be retried along with several others who were previously acquitted. No date has been set for the new trial. Mubarak will remain in jail for the time being, currently facing corruption charges. Just a few months ago, mubarak was reportedly near death and suffered a fall, but his current health status is unknown right now. Egyptian politics have been violent and chaotic for the last two years since the fo strongman was forced from power and today's ruling will do little to calm the the situation. Harris.

>> Buildings disappearing in the skyline. The problem? Smog. This is the scene ineijing, people are told to stay indoors. David piper from thailand. 
>> The chinese capital is terrible for pollution and today was one of the worst ever and the smog seems to envelopethe city making it dangerous to go outdoors. They're recommending that children and elderly stay indoors. Despite the danger, beijing streets were fairly busy today. People of course get used to the smog, but I know friends who live there and when the clouds come down they try to stay home and switch on the air purifiers. The pollution figures are staggering, in the amount of small particulates and they surpass, micrograms. And to put that in context. Safe for 25 microgrs. There's controversy whether the findings that the chinese authorities give out are accurate or trying to understate the problem. The u.S. Embassy publishings its own data on twitter and commented today hourly readings were quote, beyond index. And the highest number on the data was equivalent of a massive 886 micrograms per cubic meter. Now, people there were saying the air was fine a few days ago, but the smog ofte descends when there's no wind and china's rapt industrialization is the factor, the growing car population and people using more heating oil during the winter spells, increases the problem and the beijing center is saying that smog won't lift until at least tuesday. Back to you.

>> Harris: David, thank you. I'm harris falkner and this is the fox report, if you're just joining us at the bottom of the hour, tonight, the debate on gun control is heating up with the national rifle association speaking loud and clear what it will do to protect your rights to bear arms in this country. N.R.A. President david king saying the group is ready for a fight of words and is confident they have the support to keep an assault weapons ban from getting through congress. Practice makes perfect. Hundreds of people taking part in a practice run of president obama's inauguration and parade. The president, to be sworn in, a private ceremony a week from today. A public ceremony a week from tomorrow. And a california town dealing with some very extreme cold temperatures right now. Some of the areas seeing highs only in the 20's there. But some good news as we get word that the stateitrus crop will avoid major damage. Experts tell us. We'll have much more on the wild weather coming up in a few minutes, with meteorologist maria molina. Tonight marks exactly three years ago, an earthquake hit haiti and took out nearly every structure in certain sections of that country. And it took lives, 250,000 people killed. It left so many more homeless. Today, haiti is still in crisis mode with some 350,000 people living in camps. And all that money that was promised is somot getting there. We're told not even half of the 5 billion dollars pledged by donors have been delivered. And still, progress is being made. Most of the rubble from the collapsed building is gone and they built more than 80 schools. Among those dedicated to seeing haiti rise again, fox news channel's own greta van susteren, she traveled to haiti in theermath of the quake and returned many times and greta put on a special port on haiti and airs tonight. And here is a clip. 

[00:31:50]


>> There is a special home. 
>> Take a look behind me, this is, these kids have absolutely nothing two years ago. 
>> And because of the work and contributions of many you, samaritan's purse, volunteers, reverend graham, they now have this magnificent facility her greta home and academy and they have everything here. 
>> Harris: Well, now we have a chance to talk with my friend, greta about her experience and the great work being done to rebuild that country. Greta, you're with us by phone tonight. 
>> I am, and boy, as I looked at that clip there's he nothing more fun than opening that school and so many people helped to make that school is reality for those kids. It's wild. These kids have a chance that nobody else does, 80 kids, they each have a computer, they're loved, they are he' educated, they've got a hurricane proof building, an earthquake proof building and this is -- I hope people watch this at ten o'clock because this is one of those small times when you're like, you see everybody working together and there's real hope, a real chance. 
>> Harris: While you and i talk a bit. They put up some scenes from haiti from december 2010 on until now. You have seen so much there. It's touched you personally. Tell us aittle about your journey and really, in the past couple of years, what you've seen? 
>> Well, when I first got there literally hitchhiked on a plane, a military plane with secretary of state hillary clinton went down and our colleagues were sleeping on the tarmac at the airport when I arrived and unbelievable the devastation and went around in helicopters later and looked at buildings and just pancaked on top of each other and more than a million people were displaced and went to the displaced person camps, this is' no law and order, there's raped and crime, women get pregnant and abandon the babies and incidentally some of the babies are in the greta home and academy and now have a chance. And this is pure hell on earth, but the, you know, and I know there's a lot of money wasted, but when you give to certain organizations and incredible volunteers and heart and soul an every section of their life, you can see what can be done. So, you know, it's easy to be very discouraged, but if you just grab on to the glimmers of hope, it's inspiring. 

[00:34:09]


>> Harris: You and I have known each other for a number of years and I've seen you cover so many stories and i don't want to make you blush, but you have an enormously large heart. Th all the stories you've seen, this one in particular moved you so much. Many countries promising to help, but you're saying, really it's come down to just a few. 
>> Well, yeah, I mean, this is right next door to us, this is haiti and implications for the united states, but when you go down and see the kids that come into the greta home and academy, they never had a set of clothes until they showed up at our orphanage, and anybody down there would have a big heart or sent in a dollar anyplace has a big heart and thrills me, I'm lucky, harris, I'm lucky where I have a job and put the spotlight on this stuff I know people like reverend franklin graham and I'm lucky to be a part of their project. Anytime anybody helps, just one little thing, I can tell you it goes far, you know, it's very exciting and very thrilling and I'm just reay lucky I can be able to help. 
>> Harris: You know, I'm curious to know the length of the process now. Because, it's been more than two years already. What are we looking at in terms of real dedication and seeing things really turn around in that country? 
>> Well, it's-- look, there's so much corruption in the government it's easy I can tell you the grim story and say this is hopeless and this is an uphill battle. And if you see at ten o'clock tonight you'll see a lot of our guests will say, what an uphill challenge this is, battle it is, a that there's so much corruption and why this is one project to sink my teeth in, greta home and academy and you can't come in another country and change them. They have to change from within. It's a slow progress and it may be whimsical to think that, but we want to help give them a chance so they can grow up and take responsibility and lead their country. If you go through haiti, it took us three hours to drive 15 miles, and you say, my god, could it be true, the way they're living, all on top of each other and you see such destruction and see chaos, so, it seems almost impossible, but you have to sort of stop, take a deep breath and well, at least I want to try to help and at least we ought to try and can't just turn our backs. 

[00:36:32]


>> Harris: Before I let you go, people are watching this video and listening to you talk, they're seeing former president's clinton and bush, and not to bring politics into it, but you can't miss it when you see presidents from the opposite side of the political rile working together. 
>> In washington we fight and politically, when you get out of washington and have a real problem, and the people join together, it doesn't matter who you are, what party you are, where you're from. This country has a rich history of helping people and when it gets really bad, you know, I want the americans help me see what they can do and the a perfect example, it doesn't matter who you are, what your background is, everyone wants to help. 
>> You know, and people w this special tonight, greta and tell them more about it when they can tune in. Americans will look at this and wonder, okay, what is it that we as a country can do? Is there a list? 
>> There's so much, so many places in the world, and a lot of things people can do in their community to help, help in your own community. And this is obviously one of my projects, and you know, and so I do it-- the ones who did the heavy lifting is reverend franklin graham and samaritan's purse and for the greta home and academy. Go to samaritans purse.Org and donate if you want to this project and streamline for this project and believe me, i mean, you know, when you see the videos and when you see tonight's special you'll see why I'm so enthusiastic about it, but you know, the thing is, there's no shortage of places for people to give money even in this country and if people get addicted to helping, helping is fun. It's contagious, whether it's in your own community or haiti or someplace else. I just encourage people, get out and do something, because it's a blast to help other people. 
>> Harris: Greta van susteren, thank you. I've asked them to pop up samaritans purse.Org and I'll tweet it, as a live report. Thank you. 

[00:38:32]


>> Nice talking to you, see you, harris. 
>> Harris: Don't miss the on the record special, rebuilding haiti with greta van susteren, airs at 10 p.M. On fox news channel. Now, renewed focus on cyber warfare and you might know that some of the bank's computers took a hit a few days ago, we're told the attack came from iran. What about other companies, not just banks. New tonight, the push on hiring cyber security consultants and dominic di-natale looking into the story for us. 
>> Reporter: This is under press scrutiny because of iran's denial it cyber attacked u.S. Institutions. And 90% of americans infrastrucre is owned by private companies and looking to help in protection of responsibility. And highly specialized security consultants, take a listen. 
>> While it's the fbi that has the executive order to lead the defense against cyber terrorism from foreign states, some private companies are looking for attacks on their own and consulting firms come in. 
>> This happens every day, when adversaries come in and l everything. 
>> Andhat they fear is the intellect. Weapons, to stealth bombers and computer chips, and secret recipes and feed the wrong information to the hackers, confusing them. 
>> You can really start to change the table and bring some pain to the them. 
>> The idea to prevent attacks like the one iran has believed to have sprung on banks. 
>> Most of these attack from machines, users home machines compromised by viruses or other malicious code that' been downloaded from websites, that's a major problem, harris. The risk there, millions of machines in all of our homes could be used to strike against our own country, harris. 

[00:40:37]


>> Harris: All right. Thank you very much, good to see you. People in one town can expect an extra headache trying it get to work tomorrow. Ke a look at why. That's an overpass that came crashing down, very inconvenient on the commute. And a gentle swim with some friendly dolphins.

>> Sandy hook elementary, now sits empty in newtown, connecticut. Tonight, the community trying it decide what to do with that school. Some calling for the building just to torn down and have a memorial built in its place. And others favor renovating the school and removing the areas where the massacre occurred. 26 people died at the school. 20 of them children. Right now, sandy hook students and teachers have been relocated to another nearby school as we've been reporting. And in the wake of the shootings there, a local newspaper in connecticut report ago spike in requests for gun permi and tells the new haven register, number of permit requests have more than doubled. And similar situations are playing out in at least three other connecticut towns. Nationwide, gun dealers say they've seen a dramatic increase in the demand for guns. A plane goes down in a suburban neighborhood and leaves a charred crater in the ground. It's our top story on this fox trip across america. Florida that small single engine plane had just taken off from a nearby airport and could not get enough altitude. This is sarasota. One man to help, just as a passer climbed out of the wreckage. That survivor was on fire. 
>> I yelled at him get away and get down. And roll around. And he didn't have a whole lot of clothes left by that point, just a pair of underpants. 
>> No word what caused the crash. 
>> Washington state, a highway overpass collapses in tacoma. Crews were in the processf demolishing it when a chunk of the road suddenly came crashing down and the accident puncturing a water main to nearby homes and a busy road will be closed while crews clean up the mess. Back to the sunshine state, injured soldiers enjoying swim with dolphins near key west, a new therapy to help them recover. 

[00:45:46]


>> I know they've got service dogs, but to be with dolphins, they're there to play with you and chill out and very rewarding. 
>> Before the swims, the soldiers pedalled across a seven mile bridge, the longest of the bridge connecting the florida keys. 
>> Minnesota caught on tape. A military dad surprising his family. Look carefully, he was dressed as the goalie in the hockey game. 
>> What are you doing? 
>> The air force captain reuniting with his wife and three children after sving in afghanistan for the past eight months and that's a fox watch across america. 
>> More dramatic in the nfl playoffs this weekend. And an episode of, I don't know, pick a city. Angry house wives. I can't wait for sports. Stay with us. Sunsweet the inside?

[00:48:21]


>> We're rolling so closer to the super bowl and this weekend's game did not disappoint. And at work today in atlanta where the falcons played their he elimination round against the seattle seahawks, you cover the game play by play. I thought that atlanta was running the table and then something woke the seahawks up. >> Yeah, you know, still in atlanta where the celebrating is going on for falcons fans harris, a 20-0 deficit. En russell wilson, down 14-0 and led them back to victory and took the lead, the seahawks did with 31 seconds left with the atlanta falcons into the next round, the championship game where they will host and a big win for matt ryan, his first career playoff victory and that's important, because he was drafted in the first round to kind of resurrect the falcon franchise after michael vick had the disastrous mess that took them downward. And we're looking at the winning field goal. And the nfc championship is set. And the 9ers handled green bay last night. What kind of matchup are we talking about here? 

[00:51:09]


>> A good regional matchup. Southeast and then the falcons and atlanta against the west coast and 49ers. Jim harbaugh has a second year quarterback, colin kaepernick who ran the ball well and as a starter, and some people thought it was a foolish gamble, but worked so far, he obviously can throw the ball as well and then, you have the falcons who will be at home and I have to say it was the noiseiest I heard the georgia dome in years and they encouraged fans to make noise and maybe an advantage for the falcons when they play host to the 49ers, who were very physical defensive team and they were in last year's championship game before falling to the giants and giants went on to win the super bowl. 
>> Quickly, before we move on. You talk about kaepernick for the 49ers, he kind of took, and I watched a lot of the green bay game and took aaron rogers by surprise, but almost schooled him with his ability to run all over the field. And how does he match up with matt ryan? 
>> Well, it's a very different quarterback. Because matt ryan is a pocket quarterback and has the receivers and julio jones and ronnie white at tight end tony gonzalez to do it. And the 49ers are more of a running team and they can throw the ball, but in the era of running quarterbacks and we saw atlanta defen russell wilson rather well and kaepernick tore up the packers running the ball and didn't make the defensive adjustment and falcons have to make at that adjustment and prepare for kaepernick running probably first before him throwing otherwise won't be able to pull off the win. 
>> They were man on man coverage and almost got to cover him like running back with two guys on him. I have the big board, everybody can't see it because I'm sneaking and watching the game, chris. Houston against new england, 41-28 a minute '09 left in the quarter and if they can tie it up with a huge points spread and can't imagine that they won't. 
>> I think we can count and check mark the patriots as host for the afc championship game against baltimore, the team that they hosted last year and that game went down to the wire if not for a missed pass and field goal late in the game, baltimore could have gone onthe super bowl. The ravens have that dramac upset win against peyton manning and the broncos and matches up well as good as they are and experienced and tom brady, play keep away from brady and joe flacco, a break through year, who has been in the playoffs like matt ryan and advancing further. 

[00:53:41]


>> Harris: Before I let you go, last question, it really is maybe brother against brother, at least it has been through the playoffs to the parents, but they could actually meet each other poe he tensionally and talking john harbaugh and jim harbaugh? 
>> And now what? Harris, we had that possibility last year, and it didn't pan out, but, yes, john harbaugh coach of the ravens have to win at new england for baltimore to get into the super bowl down in new orleans and then he would face his brother, jim harbaugh, the 49er head coach comes to atlanta next sunday on fox. And the 49ers at least odds makers are making them the slight favorite. Even though they're on the road and john harbaugh the underdog brother up in new england. 
>> You are the superstar. So there you go. 
(Laughter) 
>> thanks for being with us tonight. 
>> Football is fun to cover. I don't care who is playing, where they're playing, that was a dramatic game in atlanta, a great finish and more of that the rest of the post season. Thanks for having me on harris. 
>> Harris: Absolutely, chris meyers, thank you. We move on to something much more serious, the storms hitting our nation's mid section, new picture of damage coming into fox news now. Western kentucky is what we're looking at here. Churches, a grain silo and many other structures toppled and that's creeping eastern, eastern I should say today. And meteorologist maria molina live from the fox weather center. 
>> Hi, harris, good to see you and that tornado was confirmed in western kentucky with maximum sustained winds, 120 miles per hour thaas i believe, hampton county. The storm has produced a confirmed tornado yesterday and noproducing heavy rain and isolated with storm system across alabama and new portions of tennessee and kentucky and some of the them could have isolated rotation and producing severe weather, otherwise, another concern is flooding so places recording four or five inches of rain and the storm is slow mover and we'll deal with it into the next several days. 

[00:55:42]


>> Maria, thanks for watching it for us tonight. Appreciate it. 
>> And thousands of people protesting in moscow. 
>> It's their reaction to that ban recently on american's adopting all of those orphans who depend on the united states to do that. The protesters message to the president. 
[ Male Announcer ] SOME DAY, YOUR LIFE WILL Flash before your eyes. Make it worth watcng. Introducing the 2013 lexus ls. An entirely new pursuit. make lasagna... with hand-layered pasta, tomatoes, and real mozzarella cheese. But what makes us even prouder... is what our real dinners can do for your family. Stouffer's. Let's fix dinner. 

[00:58:34]


>> Major protests going on right now in russia. Thousands marching in moscow. And demonstrators saying that vladimir putin's government is turning orphans into political pawns with the dispute with the united states. The ban took effect january 1st and rushed through parliament in retaliation. For u.S. Law that denies fees is a's. That denies human rights violations. On this day in 1968 johnny cash picked up his guitar and began hisow legendary concert at california fulsom prison. ?????? I hear the train acoming, it's rolling round the bend ??????

. 
>> Thank you, caitlin. 
>> Sure. 
>> That will it for us for the "fox 29 news" at 10. Don't go anywhere. We've got how war eskin and sports sunday. Good night, everybody. 
>> Tonight on sports sunday, whose next on the eagles coach ing search? And the list has expanded. And the flyers are back getting ready for the opening of the season. It will be a short one an quick one. An ex employer is coming back as well next on sports sunday. ???????????? 

[00:03:36]


>> welcome to sports sunday. I'm howard eskin. What is up with the eagles coaching search it is expanded once again. It seems to get longer and longer but we'll talk about that. First after four months of no hockey, none, the lockout is over and today the players and the coaches were back at the first official practice. So training camp, it's all of a week long. Just a week before the opening game. That's next saturday at 3:00 against pittsburgh at home. And with the concern whether the fans would be back, they were at the skate zone. They were there for practice. So much so the building could not accommodate all the fans in the building. So some had to stay outside. I still think some fans aren't back yet, but we will find out in the next few weeks. And someone else is back. The flyers I was inquired former gold tender brian boucher from carolina. He was not on the ice with the other players today. He did not get the final word until midday. Although he had a pretty good sense in the last couple of days he's maintained a residence here in the philadelphia area and this is his -- get this, his fourth time back with the flyers. 
>> It's a bit embarrassing, i think. To be honest with you. I'm just thankful. I mean, I know I'm sure there's a lot of people scratching their heads saying, you know, what is going on? But from a personal standpoint, um, you know, it's a good situation. 
>> The boys they're back. This season not an easy stretch of games. 48 games. Listen to this. 48 games in 99 days. That's a lot of games in a short period of time. They start the season with three games in the first four days and again that's only with one week of training camp. So the head coach peter laviolette tried to get them ready today. 
>> First probably two hour practice I've had since I've been pro since 2000 sand a lot of work but lavi appreciated the work today. I think we're all a little nervous. A lot of nerves in there. 

[00:05:44]

[00:08:57]


>> I know you're a asking the question, I'm asking the question. Who is the neck eagles coach? All right. The search continues this week. One interview that's scheduled so far for this week and that would be cincinnati offensive coordinator jay gruden. He has his turn tomorrow. Now, it looks like in the offensive coordinator bruce arians could be interviewed this week, too, but nothing has been scheduled yet. The one thing I've heard is indianapolis will try everything, the general manager used to beith the eagles, but he's going to try everything to keep bruce arians with indianapolis just so he could be there as an assistant. Which is important to indianapolis. Now, the defensive coordinator of seattle gus bradley, he's still in the mix after an interview with the eagles on saturday. The one thing that I've heard about gus bradley he's impressive, he's forceful but he's not a guy that can take control with the ideas of running the ship. Now, he might be good in terms of the way he is with players and his forcefulness and the way he speaks to the players. He could be impressive, but that's an interesting choice. But with gus bradley the eagles would need an offensive coordinator. Now, also, in the mix I'm told denver offensive coordinator mike mccoy who they've already interviewed but the one thing that I was also told he was not very impressive in the interview and eagles source has confirmed this evening they have interviewed former baltimore and current fox analyst brian bill lick and they did that last week. Now, here's the big thing with brian bill lick. Brian bill lick hasn't gotten a nibble since he was the fired from baltimore after he won the super bowl with the baltimore ravens. I like brian bck for us, for you, he's very talkative, he's very glib. He's fun to listen to. But, but and here's the big but, is he really head coaching material now for the philadelphia eagles? So the one thing that I think people have to understand in this whole scenario, the eagles have not lost any coaches that they want and there's five teams looking for coach. They haven't lost any head coaching candidates. However, the one thing that starts happening and two coaches have already been named, obviously kansas city named one, andy reid wasn't coming back here, and cleveland rob jew sin ski was the coach. You lose assistant coaches when other teams higher head coaches, and that's going to be just as important as anything else with the eagles. Just as important. So that's the one tng you've got to consider in many whole scenario -- they've got to get down it and name a coach. As far as brian kelly and here's the problem with all these coaches as I see it. Brian kelly stayed at notre dame he's well within his right to stay at notre dame and try to get a national championship for the fighting irish. However, are these coaches, these college coaches, staying just to get their schools to give more money? I don't know if brian kelly got more. I would be surprised if he didn't. Chip kelly at oregon got from what I was told about 2 million more to stay at oregon. So he got more money. And of course, bill o'brien will get -- we'll get to that shortly. He got some more. It was a strange and a bad season for the philadelphia eagles this year. Strange and bad. If there's something good about it, let's look back at what you might call the best of the season. ???????????? 

[00:12:41]


>> andy reid so many are speculateing at season's end he will be relieved of his duties. ???????????? 
>> just to see what coach reid did for this city as an outsider, it's pretty unbelievable, and it's something I'll neff forget. I hope the fans never ever forget it. ???????????? 
>> looking to the end zone. Touchdown jeremy maclin. 
>> He's a great guy. Phenomenal coach. What he preaches, what he -- what he teaches, you know, it's proven. It's worked for many years. ???????????? 
>> I got to eliminate mistake. I fumbled and two interceptions and we got to make sure we get more points than the other team and I didn't do my job today. 
>> And he was hit. They're backed up to the one. It's second and 27. 
>> I appreciate the effort, but at the end the objective here is to win the game. ???????????? 
>> we really wanted to stop them they crush their dreams just like our dreams were crushed this year. 
>> It's intercepted. An interception. An interception! 
>> That's just shady mccoy doing what shady mccoy does best. 
>>> He was into it. He was into it all week. Even when I took him out of the game he wanted to get back in the game. So he wanted to play. That says something about the kid. 
>> He goes up the middle and he scores! 
>> Hang on. This thing isn't over yet. Nick foles is just asking somebody to get open for him. ???????????? 
>> I think nick played really well. He's only a rookie. He's only been here for a couple months. ???????????? 

[00:14:47]


>> this will be the finaly and he cannot get it away. ???????????? 
>> it's a terribly disappointing way to end it. 
>> Gut a good fight all the way down to the last second. 
>> Thanks, mike. 
>>> There were some good moments this season but a lot more bad ones. Let's not make miamis take about that. All right. Penn state head coach bill o'brien was one of the three college coaches the eagles had enter viewed. So why did he stay at psu? Was it the1.3 million raise? Was it the school? What was it? My partner tom srendenschek went to state college to try and fine out. 
>> In my profession it's the highest level. 
>> Reporter: At age 43 he was one of the most suit after coaches in the nfl's classified pages. 
>> I felt like I owed it to my family to at least have a couple conversations. 
>> Reporter: He listened to the eagles, browns and cardinals , then said no thanks. 
>> I just knew that this was a place that was special to me and I felt like we had a lot of unfinished business here and i felt ver committed to the players here. 
>> Reporter: Here was hardly a coach's camelot. A year ago this week he was hired to replace the iconic joe patern. What he inherited was a scandal ridden program and the words nc ncaa sanctions didn't define penn state until july. 
>> There was no book. There's no manual to say this is what youo in this circumstances, because the circumstances we were under are unprecedented. 
>> Reporter: Instead the coach with the clef chin and iron eyes who once went toe to toe on an nfl side line with tom brady simply went to work never once asking what did I get myself into? 
>> I've never said that. I really haven't. I think if you know about my own situation with my wife and my two sons and especially my oldest son, there's a lot, a lot of things that are tough in life. Report roar his oldest son jack suffers from a rare neurological disorder that doesn't enable him to walk or talk. Jack o'brien is only 10. 

[00:16:50]


>> Obviously, my family situation and my oldest son, that's humbling because that's really what's truly important in life. Report. 
>> Football we were dealt a tough hand last summer, but we obviously made it through. We're going to keep forging ahead and we'll try to do thing the right way and come out of this thing when the sanctions are over with successful football program but, you know, it's not life or death. 
>> Reporter: This man who helped put a university back and its feet is the last person who likes to talk about his own accomplish manies. But when you meet him, and you know where he came from, you understand a little bit better why bill o'brien stayed. 
>> I think it's about people. It's about who you surround yourselves with and as long as you're surrounded by successful, tough, hard-working guys, that you got a chance to be successful as a leader. 
>> Reporter: In state college, tom srendenschek, "fox 29 news". 
>> That's another guy the eagles wanted much as we go to break we want to her from you with our call of the week. What type of coach do the eagles need? Offensive? Defensive? College? You can post your answer on our "fox 29" facebook page. When we come back, we'll take a look at today's ???????????? 

[00:20:46]


>> this week in the nfl playoffs peyton manning he choked again. And tom brady shows why he's the best new england won ease daal. Let's start in atlanta. Watch the end of this game. After seattle takes the lead with 31 seconds to go, all right, there was a field goal, but, but pete carol the coach of seattle out thinking himself. I'll call a time out to freeze the kicker. Oh really? Now the kicker gets a practice swing and he misses the field goal. That would have been a win for seattle. Now they get it again and what happens? He makes it. And atlanta wins it 30-28. All right. Good day. Tomorrow morning augmentation initiated. Vision expanding to a 5-inch 1080p HD display and camera. Touch acquiring NFC. Hearing evolving with Beats Audio.

Brine. Art, music, dance, and me. Now through january 31. 
>>>> People have made an analogy with open air and quaker meetings. People wait for each other to give a message. To say something of importance to them and share it with the community that is there. That is what is happening with open air. 
>> I started off as a pianist and never thought of myself as a composer. I would take songs of the radio and arrange them for my friends, inviting them over. It wasn't until my late 20s that I started to compose more seriously. 
>> It is part of my lexicon, the change and the dissent. The foods that we eat on a daily basis and don't really give much thought to. Somee is touching them every day. Captioned by the national captioning institute 
--www.Ncicap.Org-- 
>> I started my work, often going to different cities throughout the world. A meeting politicians that want to revitalize the city center. The nineteenth century lampposts, cobblestones, stores, and coffee shops that basically make the city look exactly like the other cities. To find organizations like this that want to do something eccentrically, something out of the ordinary. Ways to bring the visual arts. Open air is a large-scale installation designed to transform the benjamin franklin parkway. It is a platform for people to say what they want, free speech, and a way to visualize their voice. It is a way to make tangible communication and free speech in public space. The idea is to put 24 of their very powerfu spotlights, creating this dome of light. It modulates in intensity according to people's voices. It is when people speak that those lights actually reorganize themselves, almost as if you had an equalizer in your hifi system that moves with frequency bands. Like that, except 10 miles high. 

[00:03:50]


>> Is constantly evolving. Actually, from our perspective, because we are a historic organization, I see a lot of similarities, for example, between a lot of the sculptures that you see throughout the park that is historic. And the open air. Those similarities have to be with community involvement. For example, the joan of arc sculpture on kelly drive was a collaboration between the art association and the french community. It was very community-oriented. Those principles really carry- on in the spirit of open air. The association for public art fairly recently changed. It was called the paramount park art association and it was the oldest public art organization in america. It has taken another 100 years for the organization to catch up to itself. It is to be thinking of the art of our time, and that is what less -- led us to open air. 
>> It takes place on the benjamin franklin parkway which is a privileged area of philadelphia. When you go there at night, there is not enough people walking the streets, attracti them and clean this cultural stuff into a zone where you would want to spend the night. They were used at the end of the nineteenth century in paris to eliminate the city and signal the arrival of this new energy. We associate those searchlights with a movie opening or a shopping mall. Turning around and using those lights not just for spectacle but to create relationships with people. So that they know that those lights are moving because somebody is participating. It is a platform for people to self-represent. 

[00:06:22]


>> They can go on line and leave a message, becoming part of this archive that will be a tribute to the project. In the way, it is a symbol for philadelphia as a city of creativity, technology, and innovation. We have this public artwork that proves it. 
>> It is important when I work in this kind of technology that it is done for a brief time. The reason why this project as a symbol. One of the reasons I am passionate about it is the idea is that the artwork is out of my control. I don't tell people what to do or say, once the projects are out there, they can do whatever it is that they want. It is a fundamental aspect of this, that ultimately the responsibility is the public. It is an integral part of the experience. He studio where 10 people, there are engineers, artists, working to develop the project. You work with a group of 40 people and the work is closer to the performing arts than to the visual arts. Ultimately, the performing arts is what I liked. You have a composer, you have an engineer, and everybody gets their credit. We have the credits listed, the visual part of the future includes people that can set up the right relationship for a multimedia experience. It is basically an apartment where we have all of the servers and computers that are controlling the information. Even though it looks like a bunch of computers, what is behind that is the programming that makes the project. All of these different fields, ultimately all of these things are at work. That is what is happening, science and art together. 

[00:08:49]


>> They offer people different ways to know them or understand them. There is no one way, no historians think the same way. You do not know what the results will be. 
>> Is there all the time, no beginning or end. A constant transformation of the night sky. There is no vip area from where you're going to have the privilege willoughby come a people to st love messages, all I hope is that what we get 
-- that is the only thing I am hoping to find. You sit back and see what people come up with. 
>> Long live art in philadelphia. I am privileged to live in such a wonderful city. Buenas noches. ?????? 
>> I have been composing for as long as I can remember except i didn't really think of myself a a composer when I was young. It is something that came to me very naturally. I have a passion for color, rhythm, lyricism, vitality, things that evoke. Music tha t grains disparate elements together her to intrigued me and fascinate me. This has been a wonderful journey to be going to nepal. I love to travel and I love the music of different cultures. I write music on commission which is rewarding because i never know which it is -- where it is going to take me. I was commissioned by the artistic director of the network of new music in philadelphia. She was comparing composers and visual artists and chose me to be -- she gets her inspiration from tibetan iconography. I went with maureen to the mammillarias -- himalayas. A flight to katmandu which was already 25-30 hours. And we got our horses. Five days north were -- northward, where we did our field research. It is an area that is still tibetan ethnically even though the people are living in nepal. People have been living the same way for hundreds of years. It has really become valuable to the world to help the community preserve their music, there are. 

[00:12:29]


-- Their art. The community was interested in the recordings and particularly in recording the complete repertoire, he is the last of the singers. We go back to 2010 to complete the recording. We also recorded some of the folk music of the area. For the people that we were recording, I gave an an ipod, and everyone was excited to hear this music. It was very rewarding and extremely moving for me to see that people respond to this american contemporary music that was jnspired by their ancient cultures. We reported 130 songs, to send them back to the village. So that the next generations, which have them back, the city has the complete repertoire. The first one was performed by the dance company and incorporate some of the songs are recorded, folk songs, as well as the buddhist ritual music. There is a different kind of space, the threshold of this life, the first piece that incorporates some of the songs that I recorded. From a young adulthood to adulthood, passing through death. When I went to choose some of the songs from this large repertoire. And I based it all on this one melody. ?????? 

[00:16:46]


>> de pennsylvania grow choir, including the chamber orchestra of philadelphia and some of my electronics. It came about of the girl quired to bring back some of these melodies for the first time, to america. I also brought back some of the tibetan instruments. They are asked to play caught shells and double sided drums, and assembles, -- cymbals, different ritual instruments that I brought back. This piece is honoring the tibetan culture, and the rich and deep spirituality of the people. I knew there was a community in philadelphia because we have collaborated on events in the past. I wanted to bring them in so they can appreciate it. 
>> There are many tibetan people living in philadelphia and our main goal is to preserve the culture and language. 
>> The passage takes one on a personal journey. I think at the end, for me, the peace continues. It doesn't end. It ripples out into space and my hope is that each person takes somethack with them. 

[00:19:01]


>> I am very impressed. 
>> It became very important to us. She was a very organized person, my wife, and came up with a system of the alphabetizing everything. It got to the point where it could become a viable business. It just had a little garden. And also acreage. In 1993, I was the next gardener in line, she gave them to me. I did not really grasp that at that time. I did not know it was historically important. Then we got the vegetable gardeners. I e-mail him and told them that I was very excited. The left, it was extinct. I remember tling of those bonds covering my skin as he put them back in my hands and told me the story of them. Taken by french jesuits', and lived in europe by -- for about 200 years and came back to a huge transformation. It was capped by a clan of on-. This came out of my grandfather's collection, I am growing as much of it as I can. The focus of the business is really sustainability. We are looking at a business model that those early to mid ing. Then we turn that into produce. It is to avoid of ritual, and this really brings the seasonality and the cadence to life that just, you don't get, when you watch tv every day. It is a rerun. For us, it is a little bit living on the land. If it is 50 years old, is an heirloom, in my book. Genetically modified a using bacteria and viruses, which is scary to me. A hybrid, an heirloom means that comes true to form. The open pollinated is what we use for anything. We can get that point out of it and take the female flower. Before it has been pollinated, it will pay back. It's just like that. We will cover it with a piece of tape and market. That will be purer and we can grow multiple varieties close to each other. It was an african heirloom, safe for fish dishes. It is just stunningly hot. It changes the way that seed companies are organized. I can empower myself I can make as many as I want. It has taken the culture out of agriculture. People like me live the culture that are going to take it back. Everything goes through a process of reproduction. It is either fed by s.C.. It is something I don't think humans need to mess with on a genetic level. The picture of the lady standing in the rice, is actually where we got the name. It is from the basket. She is using the land, and that change in pressure. Thrashing is just the act of stomping on stuff. We smash hit, that is the first process. There are two types of seed extraction. There is a dry process and the wet process. It is a little more complex because we have to go through anaerobic permutation, and fermenting in the absence of water. To made a seeds, cucumbers, we let that set for 2-4 days. We will tilt the ankle, and all of the viable seeds are heavy. Th down and we will pour the water and the mud will come off. A lot will rush out of that as well we put clean water in that and run it through atream, lay it out. You can store it for years that way. I am a fan of black tomatoes, a huge collection of flavors and intensities. You can see the little pink ribbon coming off of theom there, it is so sweet with sugar, it makes you laugh. I had never picked a tomato and bit into it. Try this, try that, I remember the sun broke over the tree line in the distance. That is where it got so hot. I pick a black tomato of the vine and took a bite of it. I wanted to know where it came from. I can remember walking down the road and eating everything like that. Kim asked me to get to work. Over 5000 varieties of tomatoes are listed, so I have a lot of work. It makes people happy. Why wouldn't you want to do something that gives joy and food to the world? 

[00:28:25]


>> I have never been asked by anybody. Not a reporter, and nobody. They are singing and dancing. 
>> You feel at first in the back of your tongue.

[00:02:05]


>> Geraldo: So o'reilly is right, kuntar is a baby killer. Since gore are didn't celebrate his release, my beef with the vice president is more are straightforward. It is that mr. Climate change took a huge payday from an oil producing emrate that is causing exactly the kind of pollution the vice president won a nobel prize and an academy award complaining about. And the real rub for me personally is this is a guy who once accused me of hypocrisy. I ran into the former vice president and soon to be senator al franken when both were in the building for the screening of a documentary. B franken and had interviewed gore they both greeted me. Then gore are shaking his head going look where you ended up meaning here at fox news. When I protested to the vice president that I was still the same man with the same beliefs he smirked at me and I will never forget and he said well, I guess you will never bite the hand that feeds youcusing me of being a sellout for teaing this job.

>> I found out that they had had sex together. 
>> Geraldo: According to ryan's testimony, jodi told him that she and travis broke up earlier because travis was unfaithful and treated jodi poor early. 
>> Seemed like the reason they broke up is because they didn't trust each other. 
>> Geraldo: Only to find out that jodi continued her relationship wit travis. 
>> Told me that they talked a couple of times a week. That shocked me because i thought that relationship was in the past.

[00:06:21]


>> Jodi had to makes a choice. She would either live or she would die. 
>> Prosecutors hope the angelled web will help convince the jury that she committed savege murder. 
>> Mr. Alexander did not die calmly. He fought whoever this person was that had killed him, he had fought. 
>> Geraldo: Meet our first guest tonight, dave hall. Last week we met him. He is back. A friend of the victim. He has been in court monitoring the action. Welcome back. Dr. David hughes an even closer connection to travis alexander the man who was slain. Dr. Hughes introduced travis to the woman who would ultimately kill him. Dr. Hughes, how did you happen to introduce travis to jodi? 
>> We were at the convention a legal shield convention in las vegas and I had met jodi for the first time. I knew of her. I had talked to her on phone. That was the first time I had met her and she is an attractive girl and I knew that trace gallagher travis alexander is a single guy and always looking. I said there s a cute gal on my team and you should meet h her. He said introduce me. The relationship developed after that. 
>> Geraldo: The rest is his tore arery. Grim nightmarish history. Dr. Hughes, you never had a relationship with jodi? 
>> No. 
>> Geraldo: Did you when you heard that travis had been murdered did you like so many others immediately suspect that she had perpetrated the crime? 
>> Yeah, we -- we -- there was many of us who knew immediately that she was the one that did it. And there was nothing -- it was not like she had a criminal h history or anything like that but it was just some really weird things that she would do. Weird behavior. The way she he acted. The way she followed him from -- when would go on dates she would -- there is things in the courts where are she has been referred to as stalking. So we knew all of that stuff. And is so when she -- as soon as we got the word that he was murdered everyone knew immediately it was jodi. Even people who didn't know jodi that well would suspect that. 

[00:08:35]


>> Geraldo: And you to help me here. David hughes I'm going to keep referring to you a dr. Hughes. I know you are a chiropractor differentiate you you from dave hall. Even though you didn't know her well, you immediately thought she had murder on her mind for some reason? 
>> I did know her well. She worked on my team and i took calls from her and workled with her quite closely. People who did not know h her well even suspected that it was here. 
>> Geraldo: And dave hall, sitting in court now did anything in terms of the testimony rprise you this week? 
>> You know, nothing has surprised me yet in this trial other than the fact of how overwhelming the evidence is against her. I knew they had a pretty air tight case. But what I'm seeing as I sit in the courtroom blows my mind how she can even think about getting off on this. 
>> Geraldo: Do you know any other men or women for that matter who will is support her contention that travis alexander was violent toward her? Dave hall? 
>> You know, I was on the phone today with one of travis' former girlfriends and spoke at length about their relationship and I can tell you everyone that I know that had any relationship of significance with mr. Alexander only speaks highly of the way that they were treated. He was a gentleman to them and it would be completely out of his character to show violence toward is any female ever. 
>> Gerdo: The question is to both of you. Dave hall, you first. Do you think jodi arias will take the witness stand in her own defense? 
>> I hope so. I really hope so. I hope the world gets the chance to hear from her as she has all of the evidence of all of her versions of her story put on the stand and she has to explain the bold-faced lies she has told to the world over and over and over. 

[00:10:42]


>> Geraldo: And dr. David hughes? 
>> I absolutely think she will take the stand and here s why i say that. I think she will take it because she knows that she has a way with men. And I think that she is going to try and get the men in that jury to say there is no way, you know, to believe her story that she did it in self-defense. 
>> Geraldo: It will be certainly intriguing to watch and see if she tries that. She certainly is an attractive defendant. The studies show attractive defendants do better with juries especially than ugly ones do, go figure. Dave hall thanks. Dr. David hughes, thank you both. As the president vows quick action on gun control opponents scheduled a national gun appreciation day and john stossel is coming on to tell us why he guns are good for us. After this. 

[00:14:13]


>>> This s not taking away people's guns. I own a gun. A remington shotgun. I have hunted. I have shot. That is not what this is about. It is about ending the undernecessary risk of high capacity assault rifles. 
>> Gun control has been a faed ex-airment. Let's look at mental health and a violent culture and things that can really address the underlying problem and then we can start making a difference in our kids lives. 
>> Geraldo: As the white house escalates its threat to impose gun control in the wake of the colorado movie and the sandy hook school massacres gun sale is are exploding across the country and the biggest sellers presizely the high capacity weapons and magazines used in those savege crimes. Larry ward is chairman of the brand new national gun appreciation day and margo bennett is an executive director of women against gun violence. Margo, you first. Ladies first. What do you make of the fact that americans are rushing to the gun stores stripping the SHELVES, BUYING THESE AR 15s And these 223 bushmasters presizely the kinds of weapons used in the massacres? 
>> Well, actually we believe that the people that are buying these guns are current owners of weapons. We don't believe that this epidemic is affecting our whole country, just the people who already own guns are buying more. 
>> Geraldo: I don't know if that is true. In december there were more federal criminal background checks done than in any previous month. But let's even if it is people who own guns, I mean everyone flocking to the stores, does that give you pause, margo? 
>> Well, of course, we are worried about the proliferation of guns in our country. I don't really understand the necessity for these military style weapons and I know that even the majority, 74% of nra members don't understand the need for these tyf weapons. 

[00:16:20]


>> Geraldo: Now, you have a march planned on washington for what date? 
>> January 29. 
>> Geraldo: January 29. 
>> Ten days prior to that, larry, your group is holding its national gun appreciation day. What is the the idea? 
>> The idea is very much in the line with chick-fil-a appreciation day. We are ask people to go out and celebrate the second amendment b going to your gun store or local gun range or local gun show and shoot a few bullets and buy a few bullets and hold up your hands off my gun sign. 
>> Geraldo: Do you believe you will get widespread popular support? Where will the phoenix us, will it all be in washington, d.C. Or -- nexus, in washington, d.C. Or every franchise everywhere? 
>> Be everywhere, absolutely. 
>> Geraldo: What is the point you are making? 
>> The point we are making is gun control hasn't worked. There a000 laws on the books right now, over 20,000 laws on gun control and they failed in aurora. They failed in the sikh temple. They failed in newtown. And there is how many more laws are we going to add? 40,000 laws, 60,000 laws? How many laws s it going to take before criminals start following them? 
>> Geraldo: Let me ask you this larry and margot I will ask you the following. You you can argue whether sales should be restricted. Will you agree that guns should not be sold for instance to people on the terrorist no fly zone or orders against them because of domestic violence do you believe that background checks should be universal including people who buy guns privately or at gun shows, larry ward? 

[00:18:25]


>> That is a good question and there is some things that we have to look at. The most important thing to realize is that we have to look at mental health and pharmaceuticals and -- 
>> Geraldo: That doesn'tance my question, larry. 
>> I am. Personally, mental health is a very important aspect of life. I mean people go through divorces and therapy and have domestic problems and they have just depression, seasonal affective disorder. So many elements of mental illness and the one thing i want to avoid at all costs is if somebody goes to the doctor they lose their second amendment right. Look at what congress was talking about last year that soldiers who had been labeled ptsd who for maybe four to eight or 12 years had been carrying guns around protecting our liberties and our country they come back to the united states because they are labeled ptsd and lose their second amendment right. 
>> Geraldo: I have to give margot 30 seconds. Your response to my question about mandatory background checks for everyone? 
>> Absolutely. We believe that the background check records should be kept so we can see who is stockpiling records. 
>> Geraldo: I didn't hear the end of that. 
>> I said that we support a 100% background check but that we also support keeping those background records which currently have to be destroyed. 
>> Geraldo: A good point. 
>> We would like those records checked and saved. 
>> Geraldo: Thank you. Executive director women against gun violence. Larry ward, chairman of gun appreciation day. National gun apprerererere oh the insanity. How is a sport like this even legal in this type of society. 

[00:23:36]


>> The winner of the mustache mighting champion, geraldo rivera's mustache. 
>> Geraldo: My grey mustache beat his mustache. John stossel of fox news. Living in manhattan whias the toughest gun laws in the country you have a different attitude toward firearms than some say raised in an area where they say hunt pigeons. John stossel author most recently of no they can't why government fails but individuals succeed. John now believes although he was a liberal back in the day he believes guns are good for us. You have gone through this metamore famous music is issues. Metamorphasis. 
>> The the criminals are more afraid of a back guy packing heat than they are of the cops. The laws don't work. 
>> Geraldo: What about criminal background checks? 
>> Well, I mean let's start with the easy one. Don't you think that consensus can be reached between the government and the anti-gun forces and the gun advocates on mandatory background checks, closing the gun show loophole. Isn't that a no brainer? 
>> None of it is a no brainer. But, yes, are I would like it that mentally ill people, the dangerous felons can't get guns. But you have lawyers disease. You went to law school where they teach you that you can manage life with paper and procedure. And that government is capable that. That is why I wrote no, they can't. Because I discered they make it worse. They will lose the records. Already in new york, I applied for a gun to see what it is like. It cost $300. It takes forever. The bad guys will still get guns. The rules don't work. 

[00:25:39]


>> Geraldo: The fact that the bad guys get guns. Isn't one of the reasons the bad guys get guns is that -- because of state's rights you you have a place like, virginia, where you can go in and buy ten guns at a time and then go out and give nine of them away to your buddies who live in new jersey or new york or other places where there are restrictive laws while in new york city no one can buy a gun basically except the wealthy guys who have the connection to go get a hidden carry permit and all of the rest of it. 
>> That is logical and why bloomberg says we just got to close the loopholes and I say no they he can't. Look at the places like norway where they have reallyght laws and that guy shot 53 people. People can get guns. England they passed the gun ban and the violent crime rate went up. It just doesn't work. 
>> Geraldo: I heard that the murder rate went down in britain and australia after the gun ban. 
>> Australia for awhile. It has gone back up. My understanding it the violent crime rate tripled in england after the gun ban. 
>> Geraldo: Don't you feel that there must be some common ground, some practical -- government doesn't fail at everything, does it? 
>> Just about. Your career started with willow brook. A government has to get this there and take care of the mentally ill children that were being abused and not taken care of. Eager beavers come and do a good job for awhile. Over time government then abused them. How can you have faith that these bureaucrats will not collect the information -- 
>> Geraldo: With presize targeted simple rules. If you are on a terrorist no fly less you cannot get a gun license. 
>> That seems reasonable 86 can't argue with that one. 
>> Geraldo: An order of protection you can't get a gun license. 
>> The burden of proof on the regulator. We have a right to pack heat. Guns are good? 
>> Most gunsnsnsnsnsns Sunsweet the inside? It's made only from prunes, nothing else. It works, simple as that. It's a natural source of fiber and five essential vitamins. It's the smart choice for me. Stay fit on the inside with Sunsweet's amazing juices. This s a crime time in prime time alert. Steubenville, ohio, football rape case there is word that those who testified have not been granted immunity from prosecution as had previously been reported so that throws open the possibility that the players who shot those hideous videos and pictures of the rape victim comatose being handed around the picture takers may also be prosecuted. As the local board of education urges other student witnesses to come forward, craig has the latest on the big red rape case. 

[00:31:59]


>> She is better than casey anthony. 
>> In a drunken rant, ex-steuben high school football player is taped. A girl passed around like a ragdoll and allegedly raped during a summer party hosted by former players of the current team known locally as big red. 
>> It is rape. 
>> The disturbing video and photos of the teen are published the claim is made that the attack has been covered up by corrupt authorities to protect their championship football team. In an exclusive interview, jefferson county sheriff denies the charge of coverup. 99% of it is false. Everybody in steubenville and jefferson county were upset and disgusting of the crime itself. The alleged crime. 
>> Try them all. 
>> Over a thousand protesters flood courthouse steps last week. A direct response to the social media storm created by the release by cyber vigilantes of the names of the teens involved. 
>> Another piece that they put out there was that you you deleted key video evidence in this case. 
>> Ridiculous. The coach told them to turn them over to us. They are immediately turned over to the steubenville police and attorney general's office. On one of of the phones there was a picture of the victim naked. That individual has been charged with having that picture on his cell phone. 
>> A series of online blogs and the occupy steubenville protest have culminated in it a number of death threats including one to the sheriff investigating the rape of the 16-year-old girl, further dividing the town. 
>> Going to shoot the children at the high school, going to murder my I family, anded rape my daughters. 
>> How does that make you feel? 
>> Well, I'm upset about it. I'm going to deal with that but I'm upset about it. Do whatever you want to do to me or say what you want to say to me. But don't implicate or bring my children into this. 

[00:34:07]


>> The sheriff says the students accused of is sexually abusing the girl were charged in a timely manne shortly after the girl's parents filed the complaint. Amanda claims their cries for justice were also ignore. 
>> In '94 I was raped myself and the boys were never prosecuted or charged with the rape and assault to me. 
>> What happened? 
>> We went out and we were drinking and partying and they started to give me pills and i started blacking out throughout the night and I had woke up with a strange on top of me. And he was sodomizing me. 
>> I pulld that file. I didn't handle the case. My investigator did. That girl called two boys to come pick her up and they went out and she admit the in the report she was having sex and drinking and smoking dope and was going on for awhile. It was sent up to the prosecutor. I don't know what the outcome of the case was. 
>> They said essentially this was consentual sex that you had with these boys. 
>> That's correct. 
>> Was one of the boys your boyfriend? 
>> I thought he was at the time, yes. And I did have consentual sex with him that day earlier. 
>> So how does your case correlate with this case? How are you involved now? 
>> I'm supporting jane doe. 
>> What if this was your daughter who was raped. 
>> I asked myself if that was my family member what would i expect from law enforcement. I would expect them to drop everything they are doing to solve this case and I have done that and we have been successful in doing that. 
>> If you had to say something to a young impressionable girl of 15-16 years old going out and thinking it is fun and cool to go get drunk or high or whatever, what would you say? 

[00:36:08]


>> Don't do it. It is not fun. And something like this could very easily happen to you. 
>> And what about to those boys who are out there? 
>> No means no. No means no. And I stand by that. If I'm not able to respond then it is no. If I don't say yes, then it's no. 
>> Geraldo: I wonder craig what happened to amanda isn't going to happen now to this jane doe. 
>> Right, exactly. 
>> Consentual and had it coming. 
>> They will attack her character and say that she has done it before and that she is promiscuous. 
>> Steubenville is 40,000 or 50,000 people. 
>> Everyone knows everyone. 
>> Isn't it true that the original prosecutor's son somehow had a connection to the case? 
>> He hosted one of the parties. The jefferson county prosecutor had to delegate her authority tottering. 
>> He hosted one of the parties that night. 
>> He hosted one of the parties, yeah. 
>> That is why the attorney general got the case. 
>> Exactly. That is one of the reasons. And the sheriff, he has been thereght terms so he knows everyone, too. We were with him when met one of the fathers of the kids that allegedly took the pictures and they reported that he is friends with this guy and we know that he met him for the first time that day. 
>> Geraldo: Craig, thank you rep. Joining us now, ladies and gentlemen, the attorney, the ohio state attorney general mike duwant. Thanks for being with us. Tell me your personal reaction at this stage of the investigation? You know, how you personally feel? And not just as the top law enforcement officer in ohio but as a dad, as a father? 
>> I think what strikes me about t as a father is that the victim has continued to be victimized frankly in the social media. Not only having to go through the event itself but her family now has to put up with seeing things up on the internet. She has to see that. And it is just very, very sad. 

[00:38:21]


>> Geraldo: Sadness aside, now as you approach the prosecution of the case and you' watching the activities in steubenville, are you convinced that a full, fair investigation is being conduct? 
>> Well, we are doing the investigation along with the steubenville police department. We were called in in august, early on in the investigation to assist them. We also were asked in august by the prosecuting attorney in the county to actually take over the investigation because she has a son who is in school, the same school. I think the other thing that i would point out is that the judge who will try the case is a visiting judge so yes, i think it has been a very fair investigation. We have two people who have been charged with a very, very serious offense. They will go to trial. Our investigation continues but candidly we are getting fairly close to actually closing out that investigation. 
>> Geraldo: Did the status of the defendants as members of the football team, indeed, factually impair or impede this investigation at least in the early stages? 
>> I have no indication at all that the fact that these were football players in any way impacted the investigation at all. What is different about this and I think one of the reasons you are seeing so much attention is frankly the social media. And as the prosecutor in this case, I have an obligation not to let the social media interfere with what we are doing or impact what we are doing nor all of the rumors that are now floating around and we just focus on this case. 
>> Is it not true that it appears as if a consent defense is being formulated? 
>> I think it is proper for me not to talk about the state of the evidence. We would not have brought this case unless we believe the evidence shows what we have alleged. Ultimately this ising. 

[00:40:27]


>> To be divided by a judge who will listen to the evidence beginning on the 13th day of february and he will make that based upon all of the evidence being presented. 
>> Geraldo: Given the fact that the two principal people involved were members of the ex-ated football team isn't it fair to say the case has been handled differently than say if th members of, say, the chess squad? 
>> I don't think so. We would not have handled this any differently no matter who it was. 
>> Geraldo: Granted you still have some interviews to conduct but it sounds from the tone that you have concluded that there are two perpetrators involved and only two? 
>> In regard to the actual crime itself, not the aftermath, as far as we can tell we are done with this investigation. There is an aftermath to it and that investigation continues. 
>> Geraldo: Are you convinced you have theist to convict? 
>> We believe we have the evidence but ultimately this is up to the tryer of fact and in this case a very experienced juvenile court judge from cincinnati. 
>> Geraldo: Would you you like to address the parents of the victim in this case? 
>> Well, my heart goes out to them. It goes out to any victim. What we saw on tape, what the public saw six or he is he seven days ago which we had already seen, a young man who wasn't apparently there at the time but is den greating this victim and -- denigrating this victim and making fun of her is disgust. I'm sorry that that occurred and that anybody has to put up with that. 
>> Geraldo: Me too. Thank you very much. 
>> Thank you. 
>> Geraldo: Congresswomanning up, you you win the lot -- coming up, you win the lottery but after your wife cooks your a celebratory dinner ????????????

[00:45:14]


>> Geraldo: In is a crime time in prime time alert. Now, that the cook county medical examiner concluded that khan died of a lethal dose of cyanide, the body scheduled to be exhumed. Here is fox chicago correspondent greg wall. 
>> I got a call at 4:00 in the morning. There was screaming on the phone and I couldn't understand what was going on. 
>> Her sister says she doesn't understand who called her that night but it came from her brother's home. A judge has given approval for khan's body to be exhumed so the medical examiner can conduct a complete autopsy to determine how khan in guested the cyanide that killed him. 
>> I will be glad to finally know what happened. 
>> Khan was a million dollars lottery winner back in june. He accepted a ceremonial check with his wife and caught fresh a previous marriage standing by his side. On july 20 the day his $425,000 lump sum check was mailed he died in his home from what was later demmed to be cyanide poisoning. Since then, 17-year-old jasmin has moved out of the house and her aunt has been appointed guardian. The family says his wife prepared him his last meal, a curried meat dish which he ate around 11:00 p.M. But they say no one else ate the food. Hours later khan died but experts say cyanide usually kills people quickly raising questions about the food as the source. The autopsy is expected to be completed by the end of next week and that will allow the medical examiner to determine if he in guested the poison by food, drink, or if he breathed it. Ansari denied having anything to do with her husband's death saying she loved him and supports the exhumation. 
>> Khan's sister wants her brother to rest in peace. 
>> We have to have justice served. If that s what it takes to bring justice for him and bring peace that is what needs to be done. 

[00:47:19]


>> Do you think they will find the truth? 
>> I'm sure. At least I hope they do. 
>> Geraldo: If I was khan's wife I would call a fine attorney with experience. Jose baez joins us. The wife allowed him to be pureried without an autopsy. Looks pretty bad, wouldn't you you say? 
>> I don't think so. The case is way too soon to be making any judgment calls. We don't know the as a results of the test. How do you not the have an autopsy on a 40 something-year-old man? This is already putting the medical examiners office. 
>> You. 
>> That is not the family decision. The medical examiner can unilaterally make this decision after a suspicious death. THE MAN IS IN HIS 40s. Why didn't the medical examiner of office say we will conduct an autopsy there is a suspicious death and there is plenty of ways of detecting cyanide by looking at the lividity and the odors that come from the body and any medical expert can determine or suspect that cyanide might be poisoning. And the levels of cyanide. Everyone has cyanide in their bodies. One of the things that I would look at right away are the levels that are initially involved. And the exhumation isn't going to help much either because once the body decomposes it precreates more cyanide. 
>> Sounds like baez is formulating his defense. Stand by, jose. Because will the real jose baez please stand up. Uh-oh. Which one is jose? The real one or the member rex. We'll be right back. lisa, quit. I honestly loved smoking, and I honestly didn't think I would ever quit. 
[ Male Announcer ] ALONG WITH SUPPORT, Chantix is proven to help people quit smoking. It reduces the urge to smoke. It put me at ease that you could smoke on the first week. 

[00:49:25]


[ Male Announcer ] SOME PEOPLE HAD CHANGES In behavior, thinking or mood, hostility, agitation, depressed mood and suicidal thoughts or actions while taking or after stopping chantix. If you notice any of these stop taking chantix and call your doctor right away. Tell your doctor about any history of depression or other mental health problems, which could get worse while taking chantix. Don't take chantix if you've had a serious allergic or skin reaction to it. If you develop these stop taking chantix and see your doctor right away as some can be life-threatening. If you have a history heart or blood vsel problems, tell your doctor if you have new or worse symptoms. Get medical help right away if you have symptoms of a heart attack. Use caution when driving or operating machinery. Common side effects include nausea, trouble sleeping and unusual dreams. With chantix and with the support system it worked. It worked for me. 
[ Male Announcer ] ASK YOUR DOCTOR IF CHANTIX Is right for you. The. 

[00:52:26]


>> Geraldo: The state has introduced these statements that casey anthony made. It does not appear as if she received her miranda warnings against self-incrimination. Do you believe that the state in presenting the case to zealously has planted the seeds for a rehe versal upon appeal? 
>> I think so. Any lawyer hearing the actual entare gaition and how rough and tough it was may say that the state may very well have given her a gift and maybe her only gift in this trial a point on appellate reversal. She was being interrogated harshly and the focus of the interrogation and if she wasn't mirandaizeed she has a strong case on appeal. 
>> No doubt casey anthony lied to the cop. There is a chance america's most hated woman would win a reversal of the only thing she was convicted of lying to the cops. The state argues she wasn't really in custody so there was no county tubessal requirement that she get mir -- constitutional requirement that she get miranda warnings. 
>> I got a bridge to sell you in brooklyn. I think it is ridiculous they are claiming that. There is no reason for them not to have mirandaizeed her. It is the simplest thing to do. They were just afraid she was going to lawyer up and the fact of the matter is she probably wouldn't have lawyered up. A blunder are any way you look at it. 
>> Geraldo: Even if she had been convicted of the murder charge if they used the statements against her she might have had a reversal on that and a retrial anyway. People hate her so much they don't want to hear any of the evidence that in any way seems to indicate that she is not absolutely stone cold guilty of killing that child which she may be, nobody knows. 
>> You know my next guest, a very funny guy. In this case he is is playing opposite rob low who stars as the casey anthony prosecutor in the big movie coming down the PIKE ON THE 19th. Oscar nunez joins us. Have you met jose baez whom you play in the movie. 

[00:54:42]


>> I have not met him. This is the first time. Not really meeting but. 
>> Oscar, this s jose or the jose who plays you. Oscar, weren't you furious in real life that is what I heard when jose baez got casey anthony off? Do you play jose as a sleezy defense lawyer. 
>> I play him as a lawyer who wants to win. 
>> Geraldo: Win at any cost? Tell us how you feel. 
>> His job is to get her off and, you know, I didn't follow the case when it happened because I thought how could she not be guilty. I don't need to follow this. How could someone wa 30 days. But it happened. It happened. 
>> Geraldo: What was your motivation playing jose? Was that what it was about? Victory? 
>> It is a very big case for him. And he did everything within the law to get her off. And if that means -- there is different tactics for winning these things especially when you are defense attorney and he chose a smart tactic which i think was -- it was balance between going over facts and innuendo and stuff like that and attacking the witnesses that they put up and the prosecution has a different agenda and in this particular case the jury went with jose. 
>> Geraldo: Jose, comments on the screen play. Have you readed it? 
>> You know, I was given a copy of the script and I didn't get to read through the whole thing because I had to give it back to the person who gave it to me. But I think there is a part in there where you are interviewing me or in this case interviewing oscar but, you you know he, it is from jeff ashton's point of view. It is one way of looking at it. And just as I ask that people respect the defense's version, you know, I have to respect the prosecution's version. However, much that I disagree with it and I think that is well noted how much I disagree with it. But I -- I'm anxious to see the movie. And see exactly how things are portrayed. My understanding is it is not very flattering to the prosecution in certain ways. 

[00:57:01]


>> Geraldo: They lost. Oscar, s it flattering? Or s it just an american tragedy which it really is? 
>> I have been sitting here watching the show and it is like a lady susan of horror and nightmare, the poor rape thing and then the guy who wins the lotto. But dies from that. 
>> More movies for you going down the pike. 
>> Gosh, geraldo. The parts in the movie in court that is verbatim. If I said a word wrong they would stop and say this is the word they said, not this one. When they are in court that is what happened. 
>> Geraldo: You think casey anthony got away with murder, oscar? 
>> I -- the only one who knows is her and she is not talking. I think it may have been an accidental death. 
>> Geraldo: Really? 
>> That is my theory. But I could be wrong. I don't know. Just from looking at -- something happened to this girl, geraldo. 
>> Geraldo: That is for sure. 
>> I don't know. 
>> Geraldo: Thank you so much for coming on.

=======================================================

>> 
>> welcome to "hannity". Right behind me are law abiding new york gun own ires. Their names were printed because they are legal owners of a firearm. Thanks to the newspaper president and publisher janet hecheland and editor karen mcbride the families of the people sitting behind me and the audience are put at risk and privacy trampled on. They are here to voice their frustration and fears. We are going to examine what legal action they can take to fight back against the blatant invasion of privacy. How are you doing tonight? 
>> Good. 
>> Let me start a quick show of hands. You have all been outed. Almost everybody, right? You have not. You three. So I want to make sure who has been. How many of you feel angry about what has happened here? Everybody. How many of you feel your privacy has been invaded? How many feel you are less safe because of what has happened? Everybody. Why less safe? 
>> Not so much I feel less safe I feel worried about my neighbors now there are people who never even thought about carrying a firearm and they are worried. They are worried their house is like a shopping list for criminals. 
>> From my perspective there are three peopthat should be afraid those who have not been identified as having a gun. Secondly all of you if they want a gun can they steal one, right? What about police officers? They have raised criminals. You are agreeing with that in the back. 
>> I am a police officer. Not only is my life in jeopardy what about my defenseless family who doesn't have a gun. 

[00:02:08]


>> Your book you discuss all of the threats that you have gotten over the course of the years you are outspoken you are in the public, we expect that. What does this mean for you? 
>> This whole thing is outrageous. Yes, I have gotten all kinds of comments from people on-line. You never know how much further they are going to carry those comments. My husband and I applied for a carry permit. 
>> We actually applied for a carry permit and we were denied. It is outrageous what the newspaper did. Of course we love our police officers they work hard they risk their lives but the police can't be every where. People need to have that right to be licensed and have gun protection. 
>> Was it difficult to get a permit? 
>> Absolutely. It took us over a year and we did it when hillary clinton became senator. I said I don't -- she is going to take our right away we better get the permit. Now we want more because the government is trying to intimidate us through the newspaper. 
>> All of my sons are law enforcement officers. I am in the process of applying for one. How difficult and arduous that process is. The journal news is making it seem like everybdy look at all of these crazy people with guns. All of these people who are pistol holders went through an extremely rigorous progress and had to get fou -- references had to fill out a lengthy application had to get approval from a judge, finger printed background check takes up to a year to get it. It is a complete farce. 
>> Talk about the journal news. You bring up a good point here. I will ask you in this case. The journal news claim their journalists but I am thinking they won't answer any questions. Did you notice they hired armed guards as a result of the suing controversy? I want everyone there to be safe as do all of us. 

[00:04:09]


>> The elite. 
>> Wait. Hollywood stars protect themselves. 
>> We are not part of the elite. 
>> I am the new york state assemblyman for a good part of putnam county and westchester. I will tell you this has put more people in jeopardy bainesediccally this is -- they have provided a dream map for perpetrators for stalkers, for the bad guys. They know where the guns are now, where they aren't and the foil request itself is antiquated because we are now at the crossroads of where the law meets modern technology and morality. 
-- 
>> they did not have to publish these names. 
>> I spoke to the county clerk this morning they do exceptional work therehe entire staff. I asked him if he would mind if I spoke about this today. He said not a problem. He said when he received the foil request by oath of office he felt obligated to respond but he pleaded with the journal news both orally and in writing to not disclose the names and addresses. They said to him we can do whatever we want with this information. 
>> Yes, sir, you are in the back. 
>> Six years ago they did this but the writer at the time the reporter at the time his name was george fitzgibbons. He had the list and he refused to give them the addresses. He just printed the name and the town because his next-door neighbor was a law enforcement officer. He was afraid one someone he raised might go after his neighbor. Two what if a guy made a mistake went to the wrong house and got his family instead. They went and got a guy who lived out in queens so he would connection with anybody. 
>> They labeled you as sort of the team spokesman. You have been voted team captain as we get starreded. You are a young mother. 

[00:06:14]


>> Yes. 
>> Sometimes you are home alone. 
>> Sure. 
>> And now especially I feel vulnerable. There's a lot of break in's going on right now between 5 and 7:00 p.M. Where I live and in the next town over. They are warning people they are coming in and they are breaking in to make-- make it look like somebody is at home. They know there's a gun there. They don't know what guns i have. 
>> The criminals are smart. 
>> I feel like my house is being watched by them probably. 
>> When they made the request they also wanted to know what guns people had. They were denied that information. They were going toublish that as well along with everyone's names and addresses. They also didn't publi police officers. I bet a lot of them did not get published. 
>> I thought they did. 
>> I know people that did not. 
>> Mayb because it was older than five years the permit. 
>> What happened with the law enforcement officers is most law enforcement officers don't apply for a pistol license because they can carry on their shield. I have spoken with friends of mine who are state troopers and other police they were told by unions you don't need to have a license. That was your prerogative to get it. That's why we would rather you didn't have it. 
>> Let me ask you another question here. The governor of new york says the madness has to stop he gives a big state of the state address he wants to have the toughest gun laws in the country. Connecticut had one of the toughest ghun laws -- gun laws in the country. He used the word confiscation. 
>> As a senator people have to realize this governor is on the record talking about confiscation. People have to get activated in the state of new york. There are bills that sent police and turn those individuals into criminals. That's where this governor wants to go with that. He's preaching you don't need 10 bullets to kill a deer. The second amendment isn't just for deer season. 

[00:08:17]


>> This now becomes political. Will the republicans they have control of the senate. 
>> But it's a coalition. I am telling you right now people need to get on the damn phone and call their senators. Will they hold the line. You are looking at one senator who is working every hour from now until next week to make sure this governor's bill which started as a gun competition bill does not hit the floor of the senate and we bring common sense to the legislation. 
>> How many of you would disobey the law if the governor demanded you hand over your gun. 
>> Off the record. 
>> You would. We didn't get you guides in the back. Doesn't mean we love you any less. We will get to you in just a second here. Now that they have been outed their lives put at risk and their privacy trampled is there any legal redorrs? Judge janeane pirro sounds off she will tell the audience how to fight back. There is one other person who is outed as well. We will tell you who that is straight ahead.The audience how to fight back. And by the way, one other ?????? ?????? ??????

[00:12:34]


>> Welcome back to "hannity." Legal gun owners are asking what can they do to protect their right to privacy and even now I have been impacted in recent weeks. A liberal entity published the fact that I am a gun owner. And can we fight back with someone else outed by the journal news, judge jeanine pirro, her show justice with judge jeanine on fox news channel at 9 p.M. One of our producers confronted the editor of the paper. How are you. 
>> Terrific, thanks. 
>> Sean: You were outed. It's not the first time for me, I've done it before. 
>> It not the first time for me, I'm a proud gun owner. The difference between me and other people like a battered woman or someone who testified in a case sitting in prison waiting to get even with a person. I was a public official, an elected d.A. And elected judge and I understand what it means to be a public official as you do. 
>> Sean: I agree, I don't mind in my case, it's not about us. 
>> Sean: Plus my address wasn't given out. 
>> Mine was. 
>> Sean: In your case you were, everybody in the audience they had their addresses different out. I think it makes it dangerous for them and people who don't-- 
>> it's better they did it in an interactive map. It's not like a printed map, it's where they are in westchester, in rockland, where they are in relation to the highway, basically how you get there and link it and you can get the front of the house, the back of the house, it's an outrage and what's more outrageous is that the journal news, and I dealt with them for 30 years, they are in a hole, they're hiding, they're like a deer in the headlights, the perveyors of information and unable to answer a question and people call me over and over and over we want answers and they follow your kids to school, and call you repeatedly, they come to your house, talk to your friends and they're in a hole being protected by people with guns. This elitist, left wing egghead organization that's part of an anti-gun agenda is now hiding and they are in essence, the epitome of hypocrisy. 

[00:14:52]


>> Sean: You were d.A. How long. 
>> D.A.12 years and assistant d.A. For 15 years, a county judge, I mean. 
>> Sean: You've done it all and you're still 28 years old to me, but in all seriousness, this is not an area that's crime-free. 
>> Not at all. I've prosecuted 40,000 cases a we are in westchester county. May be an affluent suburban community, but there are crime areas in the county just as thfre are in over part of the country. The question you're going to ask, do you have a recourse? No, right now, the answer is no. That information, your name and your address is public, but what the journal news wanted, sean, they wanted to know how many guns, what caliber of guns. What judge,udge signs your permit and by the way I used to sign pistol permits as a gun and to get a permit in new york state you've got to comply with a background check that involves criminal history. 
>> Sean: Hold on. 
>> Your reputation and mental health-- 
>> it's hard to get it. 
>> It's not easy, I used to bring them in. 
>> Sean: This is new york and hard to get a gun permit here. What do you think the purpose was? I think to intimidate all the people here and all the people on that list. I think they had a very anti-second amendment agenda and that's why t put this together, right or wrong? 
>> I agree with you. I think the purpose was to intimidate and I think they have intimidated a lot of people who are frightened, who are being held up to a lot of criticism. This is a very hot button issue, but what they're saying is, our first amendment is more important than your second amendment. The united states supreme court has made very clear that the second amendment that we read about in the constitution is not just about the militia. It's about the ability of the individual it protect himself or herself, as we have just seen in cases, in georgia where a woman learned how to use a gun and a guy is breaking into her house. Theops can't make it. 
>> Sean: Let me put something on the screen. George mason, co-author of the second amendment and the left has been focused over the word militia and he co-authored the second amendment, I asked, sir, what is the militia, to disarm in the best way to inflame them. Now, I kind of think that puts to rest what they meant by a well-regulated militia. 

[00:17:13]


>> No question. It doesn't matter you mean -- what the word militia means. I don't care if you think it means people from mars. The bottom line, the highest courtin this nation has said it's about the individual's rights and if they do it legally and if there is a review and if the judge has to sign that permit, shame on you. And I'm going to tell you something else, in 30 years in law enforcement and I was a chief law enforcement of a county of a million people, i saw one murder with a legal gun. These murders and crimes are being committed with illegal guns. It's not the legal gun owners that they've outed here and and here and here it's the people running guns. And by the way I'm not going o go near what happened when he we were running guns and the border. 
>> Sean: You mean operation-- 
>> fast and furious. 
>> Sean: And you all know this story, our government gives guns to drug dealers, murderers, criminals. 
>> Mexican cartels. 
>> Sean: And they kill american agents and won't tell us anything about it. We're going to play later, judge, a 911 tape, a woman in georgia, somebody breaks into her house and we've got the tape and she has to shoot this guy to protect her nine-year-old kids. What happened if any of those people experienced that? That's what's at stake here and the people that don't have guns, now every criminal in westchester and the world knows they don't have a way to protect themselves. Which house would you target? 
>> I'd target the ones without guns or if I knew the person wasn't working, I'd get the person with the gun if I'm a gang banger or a drug dealer. 
>> Sean: Nice to see you. Tune in saturday night 9 p.M. Fox news channel, a special edition of justice with judge jeanine. And confronted the editor and see how that went down and two new york counties have caved to the journal, there's a group of brave americans from putnam county refusing to put their residents at risk and they have turned down this newspaper's request. Now, officials from that county will tell us why they stood up to the journal news and left wing agenda as "hannity" continues.

>> pirro. 
>> Welcome back to "hannity". After the journal news deliberately invaded the privacy of residents. One official bravely stood up to the paper and refused to release any information to the residents in putnam county who own a firearm. Next guest putnam officials reiterated their position just last week. 
>> I want the people of putnam county to know we firmly betieve that the release of this information would create an unprecedented public safety issue. I will not retreat from protecting you nor will i surrender. 
>> I am a man who follows the rule of law. We are not talking about the rule of law any more. We are talking about endangering our citizens. I hope it wasn't just to sell newspapers and increase circulation by putting over 40,000 people in those three counties in jeopardy. 
>> I am not so sure the journal news hasn't violated a law when they invaded the people's privacy and subjected them to unsafety. 
>> The county clerk dennis sand and county executive mary ellen odell. Good to see you. 
>> Thank you. 
>> I want to thank you because i thought it was a courageous stand and you did it for the safety of your residence in spite of what happened. Give us some background. 
>> Well, we received a foil question, or our county clerk did. We are a team at putnam county. We consider ourselves to be colleagues and protecting the people and upholding the law and we looked at this and said, there is really no value to this. We felt that actually aif we did give that information out we would be subjecting residents to safety problems. 

[00:24:53]


>> I sat on it a few days just before christmas. I noticed what happened in rockland and westchester county. My phone started ringing off the wall. We got 400 phone calls within three-days of the published report. I was listening to many horror stories, women who had orders of protection against abusive husbands or spouses and they were exempt and sealed as pa of the law and now they find their address and their name on a google map. If you have ever used earth google you can get right into that backyard into that driveway. 
>> Very scary. 
>> Very scary for a lot of people. That's a separate issue in and of itself here. When you said no what was the reaction? 
>> From the journal news. We delivered our formal refusal. 
>> The press conference was pretty formal. 
>> We haven't done it in a legal format. It was really a quick response for both of us and executive county executive bruce walker. It was an invasion of privacy immediately. Once you finish reading the requested bare graph your instant reaction is this is a complete invasion of privacy. And with social media and social networks and computer technology being what it is today we realized quickly that this would -- information would just be -- just too much out in cyber and there would be too much exposure. 
>> Well, right decision, obviously. What has been the reaction for the people in putnam county? 
>> It has been wonderful. As a matter of fact I have gotten great support in rest chester and rockland. But putnam county were elated we would want to protect their identity and privacy and keep them from harm's way. 

[00:26:54]


>> Not just gun owners. 
>> The nongun owners were just as responsive as the gun owners. 
>> Along those same lines there's a great sense of pride from the constituents that i focused on. They were very proud their elected officials have taken that battle on. Putnam county is a small county. We are really only 50 miles north of new york city. We are a very proud county we have a lot of first responders retired active military personnel. And they -- their concern runs deep not only for all of their career. They have been putting the bad guys away and the bad guys know. Rockland sheriff commented on that. 
>> You felt there might be recourse. You disagree there might be recourse for the people who have been outed some of whom are here with us. 
>> I think we are on the right side of this. 
>> Meaning you think there are any recourse for those who were outed. 
>> Sure. 
>> What is it? 
>> If at any time there is any incident that has been a direct result of that release of that information, they are responsible. 
>> They are liable. 
>> I would image. Responsible and liable. 
>> They were making a cessation of a terrible tragedy of our neighbors across the border. They try to intertwine that tragedy arhey have a right to print google map. They placed themselves in harm's way. They did this for profit. You cannot use the names if it is for profit that's for case law. They took advantage of a horrific story they looked to sensationalize it and amp their circulation which is profit. A lot of the advertisements that's the free market. Thank you both for being here.

>> Welcome back to the special audience edition of "hannity." We've highlighted the journal news invasion of privacy of the rights of gun owners who have now been outed and the left's attempt to limit the second amendment. Now, my next guest has an entirely different opinion and is defending the journal news, saying it was protected by the first amendment and give him a lot of credit by the way, i don't thinour audience really is going to like it, but joining us now is criminal defense attorney former new jersey prosecutor jeff colts, thank you for being here. I want to play a 911 tape. A woman in georgia, twin nine year olds, and some guy with a crowbar. She goes in the the crawl space and the husband, 911 on the line and chilling moment. Listen to this: 

[00:34:42]


>> And remember, his nine year old twins, she's protecting, in a crawl space. Is that a good thing she had a weapon in the house. 
>> Sure. 
>> Sean: It was a good thing. Sure, when I have a gun I want a sign on the outside of my house that says you've got a gun stay away. A different way to look at it-- 
>> wait a minute, you do. Do all of you want a sign out in front of your house. 
> No. 
>> It is a choice, you're right, but they had no choice, they were outed. These people have no choice and they feel that their lives are in greater danger now because now criminals know they have guns and they also know where the people live that don't have guns. 
>> But the journal news did service and the legislators here in the audience are going to make sure that this law is open public records act as an exception for guns, they've done a good service, I'm not saying which is right and wrong. The sunshine of this law is a good thing and now we know there's a problem with it, they'll fix it. 
>> Sean: So you're not defending it. 
>> I'm defending the first amendment. Defending the fact that they outed these people. 
>> Sean: First amendment is not absolute, can I go into a theater and yell fire. 
>> And the-- 
>> I asked you a question. 
>> No. 
>> Sean: I cannot go in. And forget about the legality of it. You know, if you work in the news business was that the morally right decision by this newspaper to out these people and tell the criminals who have guns and who doesn't? 
>> You're assuming that the newspaper business is a moral one. It may not be. I mean, the fact of the matter is that they have the right to do what they did. Will some good come out of it? I think goodwill come out of it. 
>> Sean: Do you think that good is coming out of it. 
>> No. 
>> Sean: These are the people living it, so they don't believe you. It's easy you for you to say because air not one of them. 
>> I think that goodwill come out of it after that. 
>> Sean: Thank you for lecturing them. 
>> I'm not lecturing, they'll findout. That's not me saying it. 

[00:36:43]


>> And that's wrong. 
>> His family is at risk is what he said. 
>> I can take care of myself. 
>> Look there's two sides to that, too, every time you-- 
>> and two sides if you're carrying a gun. 
>> I can't turn on the tv without seeing another mass shooting. There's two sides to it. 
>> Nothing to do with that. 
>> I understand that, and-- 
>> that's not us doing those mass shootings, sir. 
>> So you attack the legal citizens? 
>> No, I'm saying they had a right to publish it, and goodwill come out of it. 
>> Irresponsible. 
>> And just because they had the right did not mean that they had to publish it. 
>> You know, the government knows, the government knows all of this. Every one of you-- 
>> the question we need to ask is what was the intents of this, the intent, whether or not you realize this, you are a bully and you are a pawn in the liberal media complex. 
>> And want to-- 
>> yes, sir in the back in the third row. 
>> Sean, my name is pat, I'm a retired police officer and past president of the westchester county detectives association and affiliated police association of new york, fbi and new york state certified police firearms instructor, and spent 23 years in law enforcement on the city, federal and county level. And I can tell you that there's case law that came out in december of 2011, judge solomon in new york supreme court, new york county, ruled in the new york times versus n.Y.P.D. In article foia action that active and retired law enforcement officers, not the just n.Y.P.D. And active and retired government employees must be redacted from the list that the n.Y.P.D. Turned over to the new york times in their foia action, that speaks volumes towards case law and may work towards the pending legislation in the assembly and senate which in the justification clearly says that the exposure of this information does the record holder, their families and the public at large a great disservice and puts them at risk. 

[00:39:01]


>> Let me dove-tail off this. Yeah, you can clap. 
[Applause] 
>> you know, you're a lawyer, you argue for a living and you're obviously very good at your job, you've been doing it for a long time. Sometimes things come down as just the right thing to do. Now, if I think with all the crime that we have in society and people that do not have weapons in their home, they now will be targeted by criminals, that will probably happen as a result of this, people that had guns, they might be targeted so somebody can go in and steal guns. Police officers that arrested people might now be in jeopardy if they're retired, they are on list, some of them. And I just, you know, I listen to your arguments. You think you're sophisticated and I'm thinking where is your moral compass that you don't see that's wrong? 
>> It's not a question of moral compass, you have a first amendment for a reason. It's the first amendment. 
>> Sean: And you're giving me a technical answer. 
>> Technical it's first for a reason. 
>> Sean: And this is the second for a reason, but, I'm asking you right or wrong, the newspaper did not have to do this and these people, and i argue, and people that don't have guns are in jeopardy. Why can't you see the outrage in that? 
>> Because I don't think they're in as much jeopardy as you say. 
>> Sean: Nice of you to just sit-- 
>> last week there was a news conference in rockland county where the local sheriff said his officers in the correctional facility are being approached by the incarcerated people and saying, I know your address. Now, let me tell you, that's a heck of a scary thing. 
>> That's a very scary thing. I'll let you respond to that. That's the real world. It's not just some abstract disagreement, argument that you're making in law school. These are real people, real lives, real families, real children that live in these homes and that's what is in play here. 
>> Okay, but this is always the case. Anybody could have done this, just because they did it now and have the bright light on it, means it can be fixed, but it could have been done before. This isn't something new. 

[00:41:08]


>> Sean: The damage is done. 
>> You wouldn't know that unless somebody did it. Now they've done it and address it. 
>> Sean: Wonder if you would think differently if it's your family and somebody puts your name-- 
>> I want a sign on my house that says I have a gun. Stay away. 
>> Sean: You put your sign up and leave these people alone, how is that? All right. 
[Applause] 
>> coming up next, well, you just heard the other side of the argument, so, what does our audience think, does the first amendment argument supercede their right to privacy because it may be legal? Does it make it morally right? We're going back to our studio audience and they'll respond straight ahead.

>> Tim, representing journal news said that these guys shouldn't be worried, shouldn't be scared. 
>> Sean: Easy for him to say. 
>> Guess what, as soon as the name and addresses of the editors from the journal news got out, now they're running to beat john wayne to the n.R.A. Membership, and they've got armed guards. Amazing when stuff starts to turn, oh, there is he' a great awakening why people's privacy-- they're all on the first amendment. 
>> Sean: I agree. Like the hollywood hipocrits and fly around in their own private jets and lecture us about our suv's. 
>> Al gore? 
>> Al gore, yes, ma'am. 
>> Al gore. 
>> Al-jazeera-gore. 
>> Hollywood stars can afford armed body guards, rightly so, we protect our president. We protect our mayors. We protect our cabinet officials and politicians and I think that's the right thing to do. Everybody. 
>> Everybody. 
>> Sean: But the average person cannot, does not have the money for an armed guard. 
>> Right. 
>> Sean: And that's what's dangerous. Yes, sir, you wanted to weigh in. 
>> I want today bring in, you brought up before about the gernor's confiscation bill. In nazi germany they had a propaganda magazine, and they had an article they titled the jew next door. The journal news, their article was titled "the gun next door". The they registered every gun and the the governor is talking confiscation, it's scary times. 
>> The fear mongering headline that had no nexxis whatsoever to the article which many high school newspaper would reject, because there was no substance whatsoever in the article. And they let the map stand on its own. And I thought that was unethical. I contacted the gannett ethics officers and you know what, they said that they handle whistle blowers and reward whistle blowers, and they can do nothing about this. And a frequently asked questions, that this couldn't be downloaded and that I had the list in my possession over 16,000 names and addres all right? And they didn't want to know anything about it. 

[00:48:45]


>> Let me get to these people who haven't spoken. Thank you for your patience. 
>> A newspaper as far as I'm concerned is supposed to report news and not make news and that's what's been done, they've made news. 
>> Sean: Yeah, sir. 
>> And there's a reason, an agenda for it and creating a divide right now. They've created a sense of us versus them. The people that are gun collectors, the hunters, the shooters, the people out there that are lawful, law ading citizens that have the weapon and other people saying, no we don't want this and a rift between the two and the media has been running, calling demonizing us. 
>> Sean: A show of hands, how many think this discussion about gun control is to exploit a tragedy by politicians. 
>> And-- hold on, don't have a mic on you. 
>> And cuomo who may want to be president is not going to be president. New york is different than the rest of the country and they're going to wake up to the fact-- 
>> what's mazing, joe biden as he pushed the idea to bypass congress and get into the political side in the next segment, often the ideas that liberals often use, if only one life is saved. I can save one life, take everybody's cars away, everybody's hammers away and baseball bats away. 
>> Hammers. 
>> Yeah, blunt instruments, hammers, bats are used more than rifles to kill people every year. And al sharpton says he wants a knife control if there's an incident with knife. 
>> And a small portion of the 363, whatever the number is, rifle deaths. 
>> Sean: I'm going to pick up from that point when we get back. You haven't spoken yet, you're very shy back there. I'm going to bring you in. We'll come back, more with the studio audience and closing thoughts as we ctinue and as always, thank you for being with us.

>> and welcome back to "hannity." We continue now with our studio audience who made up of gun owners outed by the journal news, some of you we have not the heard from, you are very quiet and I wano know you've been listening to your reaction. 
>> We've had no choice, we were just outed by the journal news, there was no opt in or opt out. I'm self-employed, work from home. If somebody's watching my house, it looks like nobody's home, I'm home all day alone and I feel every time a car is slowing down in front of the house, are they watching the the house? It's terrifying. 
>> And do you feel closer now because you feel the danger is there. 
>> When I'm in the house alone. 
>> And you're married to him. 
>> Yes. 
>> Sean: He married way up. 
>> Probably. 
(Laughter) 
>> well, I wanted to know about the pin map. I don't know if you know, but every one of us, both of us know we have licenses and let now that gun owners are the most intelligent and they are the most trained in guns. So that -- what happened with the pin map is that we, not everybody in the household was named to have a-- on the journal news. So, that meant that their intent was just to show where you live. So if there's two or three gun owners in your house, they did not necessarily list you on that list. 
>> They targeted our home. They named me, it doesn't name him. 
>> They wanted to know where you were on that block. 
>> Sean: That's scary. But look one of the things frustrates me, rahm emanuel said never let a crisis go to waste. Okay, here is one. Here is the problem, how many of you agree this will not solve the problem? Do you all agree with that. Everyone agrees. If the next -- let's say they ban assault weapons and the next shooting incident is a guy that comes in with five pistols and takes them out one after another, then they're going to ban pistols, right. 

[00:56:36]


>> Going to try. 
>> Sean: Deneen. 
>> And trying to tell we the people what to do how to do it and when. It's a good thing you're doing the special because people are outged about this. 
>> Sean: What's the next step. Do you think their ultimate goal is to disarm the american people? 
>> Absolutely, yes. 
>> Sean: You all agree? 
>> Sean, sean, this is, yes, it's about intimidation, but it really goes beyond that because it's intimidation and then it's registration, then confiscation, they're talking about it right now and all of these people want to ban these evil, you know, ar-15's, I'm jewish and I think what would, what would these people-- what would the german jews done with ar-15's stock piled and they wouldn't have been murdered and-- 
>> as you study the founders and framers, they were clear, they weren't talking about shooting bambi or hunting, they were talking about protecting yourself about tyranny and government. 
>> And it happened to the germans, happened in china and uganda and start of disarmament. 
>> Sean: Let me point out one-- 
>> one right, you start to give up all rights. Where do you stop? 
>> That's, well, look, the centers for disease control, c.D.C. Reviewed 51 published study about the effectiveness of gun control laws, eight types of them and found there was insufficient evidence. The department of justice looked the at the clinton ban, the assault weapons ban, they found it was not effective. You were saying something to me during the the break and i want you to give a chance to say that. 
>> One of the point, the journal news never explained, never given a valid reason for doing this, so you have two issues at hand with the consequences of what they did, you have number one, over 95% of all gun crimes are committed with illegal guns, you gave a shopping list to the criminals who need a new gun. Number two, you expose the people who don't to home invasion, aren't protected, but the third question is the real reason why they did it. The real reason why they did it to embarrass people, to expose neighbor against neighbor. 

[00:58:53]


>> Sean: That was what-- we didn't run it, but that's what eric holder said. Ma'am, I'm not going to let you leave without talking tonight. You've been quiet and shy, but thank you for being with us. 
>> Thank you. I thought it's ridiculous they posted my name and address, why about the people arrested with illegal guns and-- 
>> we don't know those. Think about that, people that didn't go through the year long process and took about a year for all of you-- >>, but that-- 
>> and on a map. 
>> What the right to privacy. 
>> The worst thing we're going to see right now, as a legislator, your I disagree with mr. Gold on this, you're going to see bills from the senate and assembly that are going to protect us s manner, but they're going to be coupled with gun control laws that are going to be hideous to us, that are going to be absolute-- come as a package and that's the way that it's going to get passed. 
>> Sean: We're out of time. Give you all-- give yourselves a big hand. Thank you all for coming.

=======================================================

>>> We're going into nut country. Let's play "hardball." Good evening. I'm chris matthews in washington. Let me start tonight with this. Paranoid america is climbing out of its bu. The near possibility, the near possibility that the obama administration might stop the easy sale of the scariest guns to the scariest people has aroused the slippery slope crowd. These cousins of the grassy noel folks believe that any limit on the wide-open market for guns and ammo threatens their own hardware. Any reasonable action by the american people to stop the carnage is to these paranoids the first unfaultering step towards mass confiscation of everything from shotguns to daisy rifles. Well, tonight we let you hear from the craziest of the crazies. My question, are the regular gun owners of this country, people who go out and hunt in hunting season, the people who shoot skeet, simply like to pack their own bullets, regular gun enthusiasts, are they going to listen to these nut cases or to joe biden when he offers proposals next week on background checks and high capacity magazines. Who are the people that are going to decide this issue? I mean, the gun owners going to go with, the wild bunch or the town posse? David corn is washington bureau chief for "mother joseph" and joey reid is managing editor of "the grewo." Joey, the regular gun owners, pennsylvania ooip owners, practice sheeting and get good at it with a couple of shots, that's all you get with a deer, are they going to go with the nuts? 
>> You know what, chris, I grew up in colorado, people who hunted. Colorado is a big hunting state and I don't think anybody I've ever met that's a responsible gun owner can side with for lack of a better word these loony tunes out here because they are doing something different. They are stockpiling. They are getting assault rifles. These are not normal gun owners what. You're hearing from now is the absolute fringe, and, unfortunately, they are being allowed to speak for the pro second amendment crowd. 

[00:02:25]


>> David, we're going to show the worst of the worst in a minute but first your thoughts. Will they go with the regular gun owners, people in the nra in pennsylvania and they vote democrat or republican. 
>> Sure, sure. 
>> Are they going to go with the crazies like james yaeger, we'll show him and alex jones again. 
>> You know what's crucial to this is what clinton did back in '94. He got an assault weapons ban through congress over the nra opposition and the opposition of many republicans and some democrats, and the way he got it was by bringing the cops, the police. 
>> I know, but how many seats did he lose over that? 
>> Lost a lot of seats so you've got to keep the fight going after you win so the way to get people to side with responsible gun control, gun violence prevention, is to make that a wide coalition to show them that, hey, you're with people who like to shoot and who care. It's not just liberal dems. 
>> I agree. 
>> That's the key as we go forward. 
>> The raw story website got ahold of this threatening video from this fellow I mentioned, james yaeger. He's ceo of a group called tactical response, and he's pledging actual violence as a result of the white house action on gun safety. Take a listen. 
>> I'm telling you that if that happens, it's going to spark a civil war, and I'll be glad to fire the first shot. I'm not putting up with it. You shouldn't put up with it, and I need all you patriots to start thinking about what you're going to do, load your damn mags, make sure your rifle is clean, pack a backpack with food in it and get ready to fight. I'm not [ bleep ] putting up with this. I'm not letting my country being ruled by a dictator. I'm not letting anybody take my guns. If it goes one inch further I'm going to start killing people. 
>> Well, you got that. And the paranoid on the fringe right, it all comes down to being anti-tyranny. Here was alex jones talking to piers morgan earlier this week. 
>> So we did it to point out that this is globalism and the mega banks that control the planet and brag that they take over, bloomberg, ap reuters, you name it, brag they are going to get our guns as well. They have taken everybody's guns but the swiss and the american people and when they get our guns, they can have their world tyranny while the government buys 1.6 billion bullet, armored vehicles, tanks, helicopters, predator drones armed now in u.S. Skies, being used to arrest people in north dakota, the second amendment isn't there for duck hunting. It's there to protect us from tyrannical government and street thugs. 

[00:04:51]


>> So what do you make of that, joy? 
>> I mean, this is crazy, chris. I watched that video last night, the yaeger video and watched the alex jones interview this past week. These are not normal pro second amendment people. This is insanity. These are people who are essentially arming themselves and stockpiling arms. They have more than 50 arms in their house against some sort of tyrannical government invasion of their personal homes. This is basically the paranoiacs in american society being brought forward and being asked to speak for gun owners. It's up to gun owners themselves to distance themselves from this craziness. 
>> Let's keep listening to this. There's one -- I want to get all these in here tonight. Ted nugent to world net daily. Here's what he said there. Will come a time when the law-abiding gun owners of america will be the rosa parks and we'll sit down on the bus, case closed and this morning on cnn, the chair of the gun appreciation day suggested slavery wouldn't have occurred if guns had been available to everyone in america at the time. Let's listen to this mularkey. 
>> I think martin luther king would agree with me, if he were alive today, that if african-americans had been given the right to keep and bear arms from day one of the country's founding, perhaps slavery might not have been a chapter in our history. 
>> What a dumb, dumb nut. Joy, you've got to respond. This is not a nut but a dumb nut. Slaves didn't come to america as citizens, came in shackles, in the bottom of a ship somewhere if they were lucky to be alive when they got here. The idea they would be armed by anyone. He's obviously patternizing here, trying to act like he cares about the fate of black people and some sort of number he was playing here. Who would believe this new larky. 
>> Why is it that every time the far right makes an argument that's insane, they jump on the civil rights movement and slavery and try to latch their argument on to the history of african-americans. 
>> As if they give a damn or be up in front. 

[00:06:55]


>> You don't remember ted nugent standing in front of everyone in the civil rights movement? 
>> I remember him getting out of gointo vietnam and being afraid to carry a gun when his country asked him to carry gun in vietnam. He was a coward, and these guys always jump on slavery and the civil rights movement. If slaves hadn't been owned by other people, there wouldn't have been slavery either. 
>> This is -- what's happening now is something we've been talking about for five years, and that is the extreme right, let's call it what it is, has gone on about barack obama as a socialist, conspiracy theories about secret plans to take guns and dominate the country, and now because biden comes out and talks about high capacity magazines they say finally, we finally, they have something -- 
>> nailed him. 
>> To nail on, and they are -- 
>> I don't want to make fun of these people because 1% of the country, 5% or 10%. 
>> They are also dangerous because they are armed. 
>> That is a problem. Remember where I get that phrase we're going to the nut country. That's what john kennedy said the day he died. Yesterday rubbing limbaugh said the president cannot be stopped to getting what he wants. You don't think this is going to the mainstream of the right. Here's rush. Let's listen. 
>> You know, obama will try anything and has, and nobody stops him, by the way. He has trumped the constitution's first amendment and religious liberty. He has trumped the constitution on immigration. He essentially granted amnesty to a million kids without benefit of legislation. He'll do anything that nobody tries to stop him from doing. Of course an executive legally doesn't trump the constitution, but if he issues an executive order to try to confiscate guns or something along those lines and nobody stops him, does he not get away with it? 
>> Here's the point. Rush has a brain. He's a smart guy. He's a marketer and knows what he's doing. In many ways he's a showman, but how can he honestly believe that a president can issue an executive order confiscating guns? 

[00:09:02]


>> To be extreme in reaction to this extremism, I can hear less smart people -- I can imagine them listening to this and thinking there is only one way to stop this guy. 
>> David corn, joy reid, thanks for joining us. Have a nice week. 
>>> Coming up, reality check. Gun control advocates say this is the moment to pass new legislation and the gun control crowd says there's no way they will accept an assault weapons ban and president obama made it clear today the united states is accelerating its withdrawal from afghanistan and plans to leave very few troops there after next year this. Much is clear. Gone is the goal of nation-building and u.S. Congressman phil gingrey felt two so-called rape candidates in the republican party wasn't enough. He's just come out defending aiken's legitimate rape comments and once again republicans keep it up and the story that's the starof hollywood, it's right here in the nation's capital. This is "hardball," a place for politics. ?????? ?????? ?????? ?????? ?????? ?????? ?????? ?????? ?????? ?????? I am pink and I am a covergirl. ?????? ?????? lisa, quit. I honestly loved smoking, and I honestly didn't think I would ever quit. 
[ Male Announcer ] ALONG WITH SUPPORT, Chantix is proven to help people quit smoking. It reduces the urge to smoke. It put me at ease that you could smoke on the first week. 
[ Male Announcer ] SOME PEOPLE HAD CHANGES In behavior, thinking or mood, hostility, agitation, depressed mood and icidal thoughts or actions while taking or after stopping chantix. If you notice any of these stop taking chantix and call your doctor right away. Tell your doctor about any history of depression or other mental health problems, which could get worse while taking chantix. Don't take chantix if you've had a serious allergic or skin reaction to it. If you develop these stop taking chantix and see your doctor right away as some can be life-threatening. If you have a history of heart or blood vessel problems, tell your doctor if you have new or worse symptoms. Get medical help right away if you have symptoms of a heart attack. Use caution when driving or operating machinery. Common side effects include nausea, trouble sleeping and unusual dreams. With chantix and with the support system it worked. It worked for me. 

[00:11:30]


[ Male Announcer ] ASK YOUR DOCTOR IF CHANTIX Is right for you. doing? Nothing. Are you stealing our daughter's school supplies and taking them to work? No, I was just looking for my stapler and my... This thing. I SAVE MONEY BY USING FedEx GROUND And buy my own supplies. That's a great idea. I'm going to go... We got clients in today. 
[ Male Announcer ] SAVE ON GROUND SHIPPING AT FedEx OFFICE. Inc. Magazine inc. Okay 
>>> welcome back to "hardball." As vice president biden wraps up his week of meetings with stakeholders in the gun debate, outlines of biden's task force proposals are beginning to take shape. Universe background checks for purchasers. Limits on ammunition. Stronger mental health checks for gun buyers and even a report in today's "washington post" that senator barbara boxer presented a plan to the vice president to make fedal funds available for schools that do want to hire police officers. Next, it will be president obama's turn to act on the recommendations of biden's task force. Is the time now for big change including a reinstatement of the assault weapons ban? Joining me is paul hemky former president of the brady campaign to prevent gunnce and eugene robinson. How far do you see how far vice president task force will go and how far the president will go? 

[00:14:26]


>> I doubt they will go as far as I would like. I think they should deal with a comprehensive plan, deal with background checks and deal with military-style weapons and deal with trafficking and deal with special protections the gun industry gets now and put all those trigger locks and all those things in a comprehensive bill. Tough to get through. The problem with doing a single bill by single bill, everyone says that wouldn't stop that shooting or stop this shooting. If you've got a comprehensive bill, and then you've got to negotiate to keep the high capacity ammunition magazines and give up some of the military-style weapons then you've got trade-offs you can make. Put everything on the table. I think biden -- vice president biden needs to do that. The president needs to do the same thing. The nra and their folks will fight everything tooth-and-nail so let's put the whole program out there, if we can. 
>> Do you think we can get something more liberal out of a judiciary committee. I don't know which republican-dominated committee in the house is going to do this. Let me go to gene robinson. 
>> I'm not sure which committee is going to pass this out of the house either. That's a problem. You know, you can look at it from the start. I understand the point about a comprehensive bill, but you might actually be able to get bills with this piece or that piece out of committee, and maybe that would be easier than -- 
>> who is going to ramrod it for you, paul in the pro gun safety or gun control people, who is going to ramrod it in the house? You've got to get particular here with me. I want to know. John dingell won't be there. A lot of guys in the congress are not anti-gun in any way. Bobby casey is not going to be there. I don't think joe manchin will be there des his conversations s.Schumer going to do it and if it's a big city guy you can kill the bill right up front? Who is going to be the country boy or country woman who says this is going to be reasonable and let's have a majority vote for it? 
>> You're right. The crucial thing, particularly in the senate, we need some republicans or non-of the traditional characters. Schumer and feinstein, boxer, you know, those folks are going to be there. We need mark kirk in illinois to make this an issue. He voted for closing the gun show loophole and he's in the house. We need dan coates back in the senate from indiana. If we can get a few of those republicans to stand up and say, hey, this isn't taking your guns away. This isn't a second amendment issue. This is a public safety issue, a law and order issue that will help our communities, then i think we can get it done. 

[00:16:55]


>> Will you get any votes in the south? Any votes in the south, any votes in the rocky mountain states, any votes out there in conservative country, utah, montana, idaho? 
>> Yeah. We can get some in the rocky mountain states, can get some of the folks in colorado. We can get bennett, we can get udall perhaps. Those are folks that in the past have been supportive. The one I would really like to see is mark begich out of alaska. He hasn't talked about this since being in the senate but those people because of what they have done in the past might be responsive now. 
>> Nra president david keane said the congress would not back the gun ban. 
>> We have a profound disagreement on this administration first of all on what would make a difference. We don't think a ban on so-called assault weapons which hasn'torked in the past will work this time. 
>> Do you have the support in congress to block any federal ban on assault weapons in the coming year? 
>> I do not think that there's going to be a ban on so-called assault weapons passed by the congress. 
>> Gee, can we go that far? DID IT BACK IN THE 509s? 
>> That's obviously the highest hurdle. That's the toughest thing to get through, and I -- my concern from the point of view of someone who would like to see legislation passed is that if that is the center piece of a big piece of legislation it begins easier to kill basically. 
>> Yeah. 
>> And if -- perhaps if you've got background checks and big magazines which, you know, is a red flag for some people but not for -- perhaps not for everybody, and also you could vote on the assault weapons ban. That goes down, maybe some of the other stuff -- 
>> how do you do this, paul? You seem to know how to do this. Tactically, people who want to see gun control safety, the magazines, the 30-round things. People with a criminal record, maybe mental emotional problems. Is there background check, most people would agree keep guns away from scary people, criminals and people with mental and emotional people. Is there a list, police officers have access to those but what about the mental and emotional problems of people that lead to the spree shootings in most cases? 

[00:19:27]


>> Three basic things we need to do to strengthen the background system. Look at the definitions. Need stronger definitions of drug abusers, need a better definition of who is mentally dangerous, and I don't think that should be that hard to do. A lot of folks have worked on that issue before. 
>> Would the aclu permit that, the liberal groups, the civil liberties people let you get a list out there? 
>> I think they would if you draw it the right way. Right now with regard to the mentally dangerous, it's based on a court finding that someone is a danger to themselves or others. I think there's perhaps some other things that you can add to that if there's protections built in. Number two, make sure that the states are getting those records into the federal system. That the problem at virginia tech. Virginia tech shooter had been found to be a danger to himself or others and virginia had not sent the record in. Got a bill passed after virginia tech that george w. Bush signed and we need to get more records into the system and the third is the crucial thing. Do a background check on every sale. If we've agreed that felons shouldn't get ns, dangerous and mentally ill shouldn't get guns, got the records and they are in the system, if we don't do a background check on 40% of the sales, then you're leaving the system wide open. I think everybody can agree with that. 
>> Sounds good. You know your stuff. 
>> I just want to put out. 
>> It's a three-part thing. 
>> Point out one thing, very wise man vernon jordan once told me you don't ask for nothing, you don't get nothing. This is the point we can't stop pulling back saying we can't get this and can't get that. This is the point where people want responsible gun ownership need to push forward. 
>> Up next, republicans can't get out of their own way. Georgia congressman fill gingrey, the guy who had to apologize to rush limbaugh, remember that, is defending todd aiken's legitimate rape comments. Wait until you see this one coming up. This is "hardball," the place for politics. 

[00:24:39]


>>> Back to "hardball." Now the sideshow. Is another republican really wading into todd akin legitimate rape territory? Believe it. Enter phil gingrey of georgia. At an event yesterday he provided some delayed backup for todd akin. 
>> What he meant by legitimate rape was just look, someone can say I was raped. You know, a scared-to-death 15-year-old that becomes impregnated by a boyfriend and then has to tell her parents, you know, that's pretty tough, and might on some occasion say, hey, I was raped. That's when he meant when he said legitimate rape verse why is non-legitimate rape. I don't find anything so horrible about that, but then he went on and said that in a situation of rape, of a legitimate rape, a woman's body has a way of shutting down so that pregnancy would not occur. He's partly right on that. I'm an ob gosh gyn doctor. I've been an ob-gyn doctor for a long time, since 1975, and I've delivered lots of babies and i know about these things. 
>> Well, remember when alec baldwin said that you know your party is in trouble when people ask did the rape guy win and you have to ask which one? We're going to add gingrey to the list of possibility and finally the late night comedians weigh in on jack lew getting nominated as secretary of treasury, mostly his signature. 
>> There are big problems with this guy. 
>> Many republicans don't get along with this guy. They don't agree with his philosophy and think he's hard to deal with in the negotiations. 
>> No, no, no, jimmy, none of that, no, jimmy, no. No, I'm talking about the big problem. 
>> There is jack lew's signature. We could have a pretty ugly signature on our dollar bill. 
>> Our money should have nothing ridiculous on it. Just old men in wigs and pyramids with eyes. I mean, is this even a signature, or did he start drawing charlie brown and give up after the hair? 

[00:26:49]


>> Hey, lew, here's a tip. Stop signing all your name on the tea cup wide at disney world. The only way that you're allowed to have that as a signature is if your name is boing.

=======================================================

>> Time for sunday hughes call. Associate professor at nyu medical center and he has a ph.D. It's a fluke. He has written two books, swine u the new pandemic and bird flu everhing you want to know and need to know about the next pandemic. Today we are going to talk about the flu. 

[00:02:20]


>> He's pretty good at this kind of thing, too. Owe bought ticks at the mount sinai medical center. If only a surgical solution from the flu. We are all suffering. You got your ph.D. For taking care of everybody here. Thank you very much. We are doing better. We want to talk about the levels which we are with the latest. There are reports we may be short on vaccines and short on tamiflu. 
>> I want to talk a couple minutes on the flew. Ow side of david and I david did a great job on the flu yesterday. Few things people are getting the wrong idea about. Flu is an epidemic every year for a certain period of time couple of weeks usually. Maybe we have a more severe one this ye probably do but we won't know that for sure until the end of the year. That's the first thing. It's an epidemic. It is always an epidemic if we can shed a spotlight on the flu how it is a dangerous virus how it can kill and how it will cause other infections to march in like pneumonia, like bronchitis. Second thing vaccines. I have been talking for ten years about getting a better flu vaccine. It's a billion dollars to get the research going. You need a different one every year. We have both been talking about how the centers of disease control says 62 percent effective. We are the only country in the world that does a test of the flu vaccine in the middle of the flu season to see how effective it is. They go around asking people did you go to a doctor for flu symptoms. 62 percent less likely you will go to the doctor with flu like symptoms meaning it decreases how severe you get the flu. 
>> They are working now on next year. How? 
>> As david was saying yesterday we are not really going to know how effective the vaccine is until april. We look back in the rearview mirror to say how will this help. We need a better vaccine. They are already working on the one next year. That's because they have to do it this way. We need one flu vaccine that lasts 10 years. Third thing I want to say is people you may not have the flu. You may have something else. You were saying before we came on you were coughing. Infant had a cold this week. Everybody thinks they had a flu. It may not be thelu or you may have the flu and something else. You may have the flu and bronchitis and the flu and sore throat. 

[00:04:52]


>> Now no one is going to come near me. I stayed home all week. It seems like rest was the only thing that really helps. I hope you are feeling better. Why wouldn't drug companies over produce a product like tamiflu or flu vaccine knowing they have epidemic levels? 
>> People are not listening. They are producing 135 million. We have 128. Despite everything that is said they are not going to get vaccinated. Maybe they are seeing it causes autism. There are a lot of myths out there. The virus cannot cause flu after you get the vaccine. I have a different perspective. We should do a belter job fda and other manufacturers should do better than 62 percent. We will find out in april it was only grated 52 percent of the time. Bottom line is this flu virus is fluid and smart one. Every year we are chasing it instead of getting it ahead of time. It has something like antigen shift or grip. All of a sudden it can change and you have almost a completely new strain like a d 1 or a little bit different. Now the vaccine will not work against it. The vaccine only has h1n1, h3 h2 and d it doesn't have a lot of other things. Starting early this season they have a good vaccine not a great one only good in 62 percent. Plus a lot of people aren't doing it now. If you are immuno compromised. 
>> One week don't get it with a lot of people. 

[00:06:53]


>> You have to stay at home if you are sick. You have to consult with your physician. You may not want to go to the emergency room if you are having a fever if you are dehydrated you are a child and you have a behave change. One thing about the vaccine they are in the works in the pipeline there's a vaccine that targets the person in the middle of the flu virus. All flu viruses have this. This is a great vaccine. If it comes down the pipeline it will be 90-95 percent effective. 
>> Tamiflu helped me. Took it immediately. I tithin the first 24-hours. There are some risks I took i wasn't sure if it was a common cold which is usually neck up or the real flu which is 103-104. I took it I got to get back to work. I took a lot of fluids. 
>> Who suggested it? 
>> The professor. 
>> This guy was operating with intravenous. 
>> Your suggestion is if you think you have the symptoms of the flu take tamiflu? 
>> Talk to your doctor first fund out if you have common cold or flu stay away from the er's. 
>> I want to learn more about tamiflu when we come back. How you can prevent from getting the flu unless you already have it. Excuse me, sir I'm gonna have to ask you to power down your little word game. I think your friends will understand. Oh no, it's actually my GEICO app...see? ...I just uh paid my bill. Did you really? From the plane? Yeah, I can manage my policy, get roadside assistance, pretty much access GEICO 24/7. Sounds a little too good to be true sir. I'll believe that when pigs fly. OK, did she seriously just say that? GEICO. Just click away with our free mobile app. cold, nyquil, but I'm still stubbed up. 

[00:12:07]


[ Male Announcer ] TRUTH IS, Nyquil doesn't unstuff your nose. What? 
[ Male Announcer ] Alka-Seltzer Plus Liquid Gels Speeds relief to your worst cold symptoms plus has a decongestant for your stuffy nose. Thanks. That's the cold truth! 
>> We are back now. The flu and you. Talked about this before getting advice from the doctors. What do you do if you think you are getting the flu or you don't have it how do you prevent it. You mentioned tamiflu. So far have been healthy. What do you do? 
>> I took a chance. I had to get back to work. I figured if it is the flu i assume it is the flu I started taking the tamiflu. I called mark I said what are the side effects? Mostly gi. It's an excellent question you haveo decide whether it's a common cold or the flu. Common cold usually has a lower fever usually congestion you have sore throat but your body aches are not as bad. Flu is much more pronounced it really knocks you out. Fever 103 and 104. Severe body aches unproductive cough. I started taking tamiflu. There are side effects. At the same time you want to get better you take sudafed andal seltzer. I am worried about the increasing toxicity and the effect of it on the liver. 
>> Binge, binge, binge. I was wondering about this. If you look at the ingredients not everybody does they take it off the shelf. Acetaminophen nonprescription drug highly recommended has 625 or 650 milligrams of acetaminophen. That's higher than the normal company soules. If you take that as many as 12 capsules in 24-hours that's a lot of lenol. 

[00:14:17]


>> With flu season everybody is loading up on the products. Acid mid fin in 600 products. It is in more prescription drugs than any other chemical we have. 28 million people are saking acetaminophen alone stand alone but it's in 600 other products. 
>> It is bad for the live. 
>> Terrible things for your liver. If you have more than 4,000 milligrams a day it's damaging to your liver. You don't need that if you are drinking alcohol or other sources. We have a big problem with this. Children under should not be taking it at all. If you are over 2 you should be eliminating it. I don't think you should be get anything where near 4 grams of this stuff. 4 glams is about 8 pills. Tylenol has 500 milligrams. It's about 8 pills which is what you are were saying. 
>> Add up everything make sure you don't get 4,000. 
>> Maybe you use ibuprofen one day and acetaminophen another. They are telling manufacturers we don't want more than 325 milligrams in there max numb. That's not enough. Plenty of these products can add up with colds and flu. 
>> This is a very important point. If you take a lot of cold medicines percocet, vicodin the list goes on and on it adds up. You don't realize there's acetaminophen on this. You want to make it worse add alcohol to it and you are done. That's real liver toxicity. Abdominal pain nausea and vomiting. It you catch the toxicity in the first 8 hours what they do is doctors would put in and use gastric they wash the stomach and they give you some antidotes. 
>> Charcoal. 
>> Watch your levels and doctor segal what do you do if you think you are getting it? 

[00:16:21]


>> You do what he said you go to the emergency room right away. It's less than 2 percent fatal if we get it right away. It is the number one cause of acute liver damage in the united states. It is beating hepatitis now. 
>> Don't mix medication and don't miss medication with alcohol. 
>> Last word. 
>> As usual. 
>> Meanwhile we are telling you about all of the things you can take wit prescription and nonprescription. How about natural remedies. A lot of people want to go that route. The doctors are back with a look at some of the natural remedies to tell you which ones will give you much needed relief. you else. And you wouldn't have it any other way. But your erectile dysfunction - you know, that could be a question of blood flow. Cialis tadalafil for daily use helps you be ready anytime the moment's right.

[00:20:50]


>> Back now with more on the flu and you. You know there are no cures for the common cold or the flu but there are natural remedies that can be very effective. Dr. Seigel we have been talking about over the counter medications, going to the doctor, dealing with flu symptoms. What kind of natural remedies can actually help? 
>> One is something they used back in 1918 for the spanish flu. Yellow jasmine. It is the name of a beautiful flower. It worked in 1918 but studies have not confirmed that. It is expected to cut down on death rates. 
>> What is it? 
>> Josimion. 
>> The other thing? Elder berry which has been studied in israel in 2004 and was found to decrease in a nice double blind study it decreased flu symptoms. Elder berry is a possibility. The other one I found impress i is ginseng. There's a study in mice. Looking at ginseng it increased 
-- increased the amount of flu virus you had and I think it has potential for humans. If I were to do it now I would say ginseng tea and elder berry tea. I would not take this instead of tamiflu. Not instead of a flu vaccine but it's an interesting thing add. 
>> The only thing that comes close to tamiflu is ang go graphics. It is list of some the herbs up again. It shortens the period of flu. When it comes to echinacea there are mixed data. Recently in december there was a great study that came out of switzerland it showed that echinacea can help you against cold and flu, et cetera. Obviously ginger is a favorite one out of all of that because it not only causes antiinflammatories, it boosts your immune system. That happens is our system breaks down from not getting enough sleep when the virus gets in it can shut it down. By boosting the immune system some of these herbals a fantastic. You can look them up and purchase them. 

[00:23:14]


>> The only reason I ask is a of peopl say when they get sick I am loading up on vitamin c. 
>> Vitamin c it wasn't a great study. It has never been shown to decrease flu symptoms or the flu. I would say no. Another one that was brought to my attention which I looked up one of our anchors asked about it not shown to decrease flu symptoms but may increase your immune system. 
>> We have more even. What do you have, what do you do if you aeady have the flu? Eick specifically requested if you are right now and you are sick he wants to tell you what to do. He will tell you next. ] day news starts with arthritis pain and a choice. Take tylenol or take aleve, the #1 recommended pain reliever by orthopedic doctors. Just two aleve can keep pain away all day. Back to the news. over choices of Green Giant vegetables it's easy to eat like a giant... ?????? ?????? and feel like a Green Giant. ?????? ?????? Ho Ho Ho ?????? Green Giant ?????? doing? Nothing. Are you stealing our daughter's school supplies and taking them to work? No, I was just looking for my stapler and my... This thing.

[00:27:46]


>> Jamie: Well, it's me, but this is eric's request. He wants to know, if we didn't say it -- what do do you if you are home sick? 
>> I would say fluids, fluids, fluids. Dehydration is the first thing that will really get you to the doctor. Make sure you take a lot of fluids. What helped me was the humidifier with vicks. I covered my chest with that. The air was really dry. Hand wash, which I know mark will talk about. But if you are immuno-compromised, diabetic, over 65, you need to wear a mask to protect yourself, there is nothing wrong with it. 
>> Ther. 
>> Jamie: The reason they wear them in the operating room. 
>> Absolutely. 
>> You know, there is a flu attack rate. One out of four people around a flu patient will get the flu. You can cut down with hand wipes, stay home for a week afterwards because you are shedding virus. If you take tamiflu, which i recommend if you have someone vulnerable, get it within the first 48 hours. Consult your physician. If your child and behavior is changing, get in to be seen urgently. 
>> Eric: Chicken soup. They knock it as a method. Real? 
>> I love it. Opens up your passages and warms up your mouth. It's great. 
>> If you are sick, stay home because that's how we are going to break down the spread of this virus all over the country. 
>> You learn that the emergency room is so germy, go only as last resort. That's really good advice. 
>> You are getting in the way of people who may be having heart ark tax. If you go to the emergency room and you don't need to be there, it's not good for you or anyone else. 
>> And there's a lot of germs. Thanks so much, doctors. Stay well, everybody.

>> Save a horse, ride a cowboy. 
>> Ladies and gentlemen, governor mike huckabee. 
>> Mike: Great audience, thank you so much. Welcome to huckae in the fox news studios in new york city. I found a new way this week to make liberals really really mad at me. Here is what you do. Just repeat what liberals are saying. They hate it when conservatives agree with them. All right. The "new york times" started all of this by publishing a photo of the president meeting with what the white house described as his key economic advisors during the fiscal cliff negotiations. They noted everyone in the room was of the male gender. The white house press core peppered jay carney about all the men he has appointed to major s and carney dug his own hole and jumped in it by saying the president is looking for the best people. That caused some the women supporters of president to ask if he was saying that there weren't any qualified women available? Democratic congressman charlie rangel got even more blunt. Here is what he said. Just see it for yourself? 

[00:02:14]


>> I wonder. 
>> If it speaks for itself what does it say going into the second term. 
>> It's embarrassing as hell. 
>> When cnn covered the nomination of jack lew for treasury a second it ran a banner said another white man added to second term cabinet. Even now the national organization for women sent an email that proved the old adage hell hath no fury like a woman scorned. I'm just repeating that i didn't originate it on my radio show I simply stated the obvious as already affirmed by the not so conservative "new york times" charlie rangel now and others. And that's president's cabinet and inner circles seem loaded with testosterone and running a little low on estrogen. For the women who thought that the president had promised women a more prominent role in his administration, I just remind to you review the speeches democratic national convention. The cry from the podium was not so much for positions of authority, but for free birth control pills and abortions. Any time, any place for any reason and it at no cost. The image of women at the democrats' convention was that women were utterly helpless unless the government stepped in and provided birth control and abortns that perception was furthered by the absurd political ad of the obama campaign about a woman named julia who from cradle to grave depended on good old uncle sugar for everything from education, a job, healthcare, food, housing, and retirement. Now, the women in my family and the women I know and work with, well, frankly, they are as good as any of the men that I know and work with I never thought of them as being helpless and unable to function without someone from the government or some man sheparding them through life. Silly me. It just never occurred to me that I needed to see women as helpless. I guess that's why the liberals went stark rating linda blair with her head spinning circles and pea soup enraged at me. I'm not the one that you ought to be mad at. I was just saying what some of your heros have said. You see, if women aren't getting much more than birth control pills and abortion from this administration, sure not my fault. I don't support taking the life of babies anyway. And I'm okay if you want contraceptives, but since you want me out of your bedroom, i just don't know why I have to pay for what happens in there. That's my view. 

[00:04:50]


[ Applause ] well, joining me now conservative columnist and founder of the center for urban renewal and education please welcome star parker. 
[ Applause ] 
>> hi, governor. Hello there. How are you? I think most people agree people ought to be appointed on the basis of merit. But the point of what I was saying, there has been a lack of diversity for all the promises made. Does that ring a little hollow in some of the things he said? 
>> Well, we know that he conforms to whatever people outside of his circles say, but I think on this one it is his did I strers city plan. The discrimination that has gone on against rich white males last four years of affirmative action maybe he feels sorry for them, I don't know. 
[ Laughter ] what's going on. 
>> Maybe it's a new level. 
>> It's a new level of quota. 
>> One thing I want us to talk been a one of the main reasons for you being here. As if jersey shore and honey boo boo weren't bad enough, now the oxygen network is about to debut a show about an atlanta rapper who has fathered 11 children from 10 different women. Show called all my baby's mom mass. I want you to see a clip of the father. Here he is trying to remember the clips of the names of his children. 
>> My third child is britney pickens. Oh, the fourth is tiana hill. The fifth is laqella turner. 
[ Buzzer ] 
[tick tock] let me think. Little boy. 

[00:06:50]


>> Mike: Amazing. The show shonty responsible. Critics call the show offensive and petition to shut down the series before it even airs. That petition has gotten thousands of signatures. Star, does it shock you? We have gone from ozzy and harriett and leave it to beaver and then to the cosby show and brady bunch and now stuff like this? 
>> Right. Murphy brown and mocked us we wouldn't get to this low. It's not news that the majority of black children now are born outside of marriage. We know 7 a% or close to that number as opposed to 25% in the 60's. It's not news anymore that record numbers of black men today are fathering children by multiple women. This is happening too much. But what is news on this is that oxygen thinks it's funny. When you think about what this means. When we look at what has happened in black america, leading on aids, like on out-of-wedlock birth almost six out of 10 of the babies being aborted in this community this should be an embarrassment to black america it certainly certain solid is a tragedy to our history and legacy and ancestors. It's a blight. An economic blight on our society. We're talking $600 billion a year in these welfare programs and they think this is humor? This is something we should reward and intralt? We have reached a real new low. 
>> Mike: You spent a lot of your adult life fighting against not only the stereotype but in your own life the struggle that you came through to be today leading an organization to help empower people to be on their own. 
>> That's right. I actually live the lie of the left. Seven years in and out oof welfare dependency. I believe the poor are poor because the wealthy were wealthy. I believed my problems were somebody else's fought. I believed america was so inherently racist, I ended up seven years in and out of welfare. Three and a half years until a christian conversion changed my life. Today I run urban cure.Org we look at market based solutions to fight poverty. This is not helping to celebrate what has broken down so horrifically in this community. I'm wondering if now we can survive. If you can be rewarded for this type of ill behavior, then where do key stop? How do we put the plug on what has happened to destroy the legacy of blacks in this country? 

[00:09:06]


>> Star, oobviously, you feel very offended as an african american and as a woman that the show would come out and depict essentially a whole group of women almost being kept if you will by this rapper who can't even name his own kids. 
>> They are not being kept. I can guarantee you if we go into their lives we are going to see welfare dependency in and out. This is not few black america. What we are looking at are children who are going to be extremely confused. Going to go into a public school system that teaches them moral relativism and secular museumism and pattern their lives after their parents. The dad has two boys in this equation. These two boys will probably repeat his habits. The daughters, awful these girls are goi to look at this and the way that their mothers being treated and accept that as normal. This is horrible what oxygen has done. I actually commend the young woman -- she a committee of one who says I'm going to start a petition. Where are some of these leaders who pretend that they care will the plight of the poor and the black america? Where is jesse jackson today or al sharpton and others who keep insisting that they can mount up all of these protests. 
[ Applause ] 
>> Mike: That's the point that does concern me. You are speaking out about it it, your organization does. I'm not hearing a whole lot of people who are so-called leaders in the civil rights movement or even in the antipoverty movement saying that something is wrong when you glorify this lifestyle. 
>> This should have been knocked on the door and privately discussed and we would not even have had it become news today that oxygen would even dare to touch this. To think it's funny. To make it humor for people to enentertain themselves over. We are not seeing those protests. We are seeing them through the perception of racism industry. When there is a real problem coming through and using black america and especially to take advantage of these horrible situation that these women have gotten themselves into they are silent. They are always silent when there is a real crisis. 
>> Mike: That is a crisis in itself. Star parker thanks for being here. Thanks for being outspoken about an amazing kind of -- 

[00:11:15]


[ applause ] 
>> Mike: The president said he raised taxes on the rich to raise taxes on the middle class. Why is the middle class being taxed more. Coming up country super star john rich and business owners travis perry and william march join me to talk about how taxes are affecting them and their employees. Stay with us.

>> If you have got a job and got your first paycheck of the new year, I bet you have noticed that your pay was less than the amount of your last check of 2012. And you are not the only one. Thousands have taken to twitter to give their thoughts on the new payroll tax increase. Here is just a few samples. One said just noticed all my employees part time hourly and et cetera will have more tax dollars taken out of their checks contrary to president's promise. Liar? Another one says did new tax goes into effect today? Something I don't understand about the fiscal cliff. I got a raise yet, my paycheck got smaller. Obama promised to increase taxes on families raising less than $250,000 a year. Why do I have $30 less in my paycheck, mr. President. The president and his fellow democrats aren't done yet. They now want to increase more tax revenue by limiting your deductions. Joining me to talk about the impact of these new taxes. Country singer john rich, half of the duo big and rich. Inadventure and managing partner of chord buddy a guitar learning tool travis berry. President of products william marsh comes back to join us again. Good to have all of you here. I want to start william with you and travis because right now you are running some businesses and you have got employees that got their checks and they said whoa, what did your employees say when they got their first checks and thought you had cut their wages? 
>> The first thing occurred to me when I came back to the company after the end of the year, my employees. They said our paycheck is wrong. Something has gone wrong. It it's lower than it used to be. I said I don't know. I'm not sure what's happening. Let me take a look at it? 

[00:15:36]


>> Each one of their paychecks making $50 a week less because the taxes going up on the average employee. 
>> Mike: That's real money for the people who work for you, isn't it? That's $200 a month. 
>> No doubt about it. A lot of my employees commute from new jersey. It's 20 or 30 miles. That's a gas tank of fuel for them each week. So it has a substantial impact on the average american. 
>> Mike: Travis, you have got really a new company. It's a start-up company. You are building a wonderful little tool to teach people guitar. As a start-up company, how do these taxes hit you when you are trying to launch and get going? You won the shark tank and that was a great thing. But it looks like the real sharks may be in washington right now. 
[ Laughter ] 
>> absolutely. Difficulty toe to exactly what he said was on the road most of december. Out pushing my product. Traveling with it all over the country. I came home and had my managers come to me and said, man, our paychecks are all jacked um. I said what's wrong? And a to be totally honest, I'm working so much, I didn't know. And we use software formula that automatically deducted it. And one of my main employees told me said travis, I have either got to get some overtime to make up for this or I have got to look for another job. 
>> Mike: Wow. John, you are one of those evil 1 percenters. 
>> Bad guys. 
>> I'm awful. 
>> Mike: I don't know if i want to sit this close to you. 
>> Yeah. 
>> Bill: You are in that upper 1%. Here is what I want people to know. 
>> That crawls all over me to hear that by the way. 
>> Mike: You didn't start out 1 percenter maybe 1% in the other end of the spectrum. 
>> Grew up in texas in double wide trailer we were lean and mean. We were fine missing meals. Lean and mean to go to that from 20 years in country music and having a great career thanks to all the fans and supreme supporting me all these years. 
[ Applause ] now I hire a lot of people. We have got probably, if you added everybody up, I'm somewhere between 40 and 50 employees. 

[00:17:42]


>> Mike: You have got a will the of people. 
>> Bus drivers and sound guys and band guys and everything that goes along with a tour. 
>> Mike: You have been hit not only with the tax increases that these guys have talked about. Because you are one of those evil guys in that upper crust. Something has got to go. What's going to happen to you and the people that you hire on the road as a result of the increase in tax, probably 7%, 8% all tolled you will be paying more? 
>> It's big. You are running a business. You know, you want to run a successful business. You don't want to run it in the red. You want to run it in the black. 
>> Mike: Yeah. 
>> You are looking at big chop like 6%, 7% in 2013 that you weren't paying in 2012. That's a lot. You are looking at well, can we get by with one less bus or can di a five piece band instead of six piece band and on and on and on it goes. I can't believe americans didn't get their head wrapped around that hey, if your boss get dinged, you are going to get dinged. That's the way it goes to. Be an evil rich guy? Give me a break. That's crazy talk. 
[ Applause ] 
>> Mike: William, you are running a manufacturing business which is very tough because you are competing with people all over the world. Your employees are they demoralized? Does it make it tougher for you to get them to be motivated to work as hard? 
>> Sure it does. With an employee makes less every week he is not as inclined to work. We see product coming in from europe. Our company has a big opportunity to make a new product class. The second call that i received on coming back from the new year was my accountant. Her message was-to-me was we need to talk about tax. Already I'm being scheduled to make tax payments. If I'm paying taxes to the program government for increased taxes on my business, I'm not able to buy new equipment. I'm not able to put more men to work. And my men's future is less certain because it's the money that I invest in equipment which gives them their job security, the productivity and the wages they enjoy. 
>> Mike: So capital expenses go down. 
[ Applause ] bill. 
>> Mike: Because you don't have the capital to expand the business. 

[00:19:45]


>> Equipment that american manufacturers rely on to compete in a low wage global environment go away. Mike mipg travis, what happens in your business in this coming year? 
>> We had two huge rollouts the left model for chord buddy 20% of people are left handed the classical model for chord buddy will not happen. We will not get the breaks that we needed to write off that money, you know, tax wise. 
>> Let it's not there anymore new product somebody has got it to build if it and ship it and sell it it's several jobs down the line that went happen because you don't have the money to make that work. 
>> Right. 
>> All right. And, john, you talked about there may be fewer folks out on the road with you. 
>> Yeah. That means what happens to those people? Where do they go? What can they do? 
>> It's that effect of people losing jobs. And, you know, it's -- I mean, it's a painful thing to let somebody go that you have been working with for years and years. Especially in music and what i do. That's part of what you do. It's part of your sound. At the end of the day you are looking at your paper and looking at your numbers. And I'm not going to run a business in the red. I'm not going to do it niece not how I got where I'm at running in the red. If I have to make a hard call I will have to. 
>> Mike: Have a lot of people on the left demonized you. 
>> I take it personal. People occupy wall street and guys camping out on ipads that their daddy bought for them no doubt. Outhere being a bunch of ?????? nosed brats in my opinion. I'm here working my way uphe chain and they're going to protest me? Really really. You sit out there and just wipe your ??????y nose and stay on your ipad and protest me all day long I will be out there playing a concert working. 
>> Mike: What I'm always troubled by you can't say what you really think that's always a problem. 

[00:21:46]


>> How do you feel about it, john? I'm actually being nice about it if you want to hear the truth. 
>> I have heard you back stage. Thanks for not saying that on air. 
>> I was looking to get bleeped. I won't do it. 
>> Mike: Thank you for not doing it great to talk to you. John and travis are going to be back later in the show he to talk about innovative way of helping aspiring musicians learn the guitar, that nice little device we were talking about. And we are going to be joined by the little rockers for one of john's big hits. Next I will talk retired four star general stanley mcchrystal how we can make sure that the men and women of our militare properly equipped for battle. We'll be right back. 

[00:25:46]


>> Mike: On thursday the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff martin dempsey talk about the impact congress' ab to come up with spending plan is going to have on our military. 
>> Operation, maintenance and training will be gutted. We'll grand aircraft. Return ships to port and sharply curtail training across the force. We will be unable to reset the force following a decade of war. Our readiness will begin to erode. Within months, we will be less prepared. Within a year, we will be unprepared. 
>> Wow, pretty serious stuff. Joining me with his reaction retired four star general and author of the new book my share of the task. General stanley mcchrystal. General, it's great to have you here. Quite an honor. 
[ Applause ] there is real anxiety within the military community because what the chairman of the joint chiefs martin dempsey said, that's pretty stout stuff. How does this effect day to day that guy that woman out there in the military and what's going on in their heads as they look at the sequestration and the effects. 
>> Thanks, governor. I served for more than 34 years. One thing it taught me is to understand what it is you are affecting. I grew up alongside soldiers. Last decade I served in combat with countless professionals. That's what marty dempsey is talking about. There are necessarily going to be reductions in defense spending and if they are responsibly done as secretary gates laid out that's probably fine. If you do a sequestration that's irresponsible way to cut. Suddenly you can't cut every part of the defense budget. Many parts of that was protected for various reasons. As marty laid out you gut people. And when you gut human capital, you are going to pay a price that can't be caught up for a generation. 
>> Mike: The difference is with sequestration it's there is no discretion. It's just across the board. You just cut everywhere. It's almost like going into an operating room and instead of surgically remove a tumor you say we will remove 20 pounds of flesh out of this body regardless of where it is coming from. That's what this problems, isn't it. 

[00:27:55]


>> It's worse than that instead of giving the leadership the chance to cut $40 billion over the rest of 2013 anywhere they want, there are certain areas, certain programs that cannot be cut. Therefore they will have to cut out of what he described as operations and maintenance money. That's what let's the force operate and train. What really let's you take care of people. 
>> In the peculiar my share of the tank, you talk about your career and also obviously a lot of it focused on afghanistan. The fact that you led our troops there yesterday the president of afghanistan, the president of the united states held a press conference in essence a lot of things just didn't work out real well. Men and women of achievement military, including yourself who put your lives on the line got shot at. Do you feel like maybe people are thinking it was for nothing? 
>> I think there is always that danger. I got an email from a friend of mine there now. I spoke to president karzai on the phone last night. But when I got to afghanistan in the spring of 2002, the place was physically devastated and it was mentally trauma advertised. It was torn apart in every way. And it's very differ different now. There has been huge progress in the rights of women, children in school. Development, it's not perfect. Lots of problems. But afghans have a lot to lose now. I think what scares afghans more than anything else is a return to the dark days of the taliban or maybe worse. 
>> Is the president, you think, fully schooled in terms of being able to it lead this point of the military? I'm not trying to be just hyper critical of the president. I'm concerned that when I hear him say maybe we just need to go ahead and get out quicker rather than later and we are not going to leave troops there. Are we exiting too soon to the detriment of the long-term benefit of afghanistan? 
>> Well, leadership is a passion of mine. I teach it at yale. My book is about leadership. It's what I have always been fascinated by. I think leadership is a combination of people. It's a president. It's a congress. It's it military leaders. It's relationships. When we think about leadership. We need to think of collective responsibility to make really sane decisions because they are going to be really really hard. Afghanistan is complex. There is no simple easy solution. Visitors used to say to me okay, general, what's the one thing wrong with afghanistan? I will say you will never understand as soon as you simplify it that much. 

[00:30:19]


>> Your book is, think a great insight into not just your military career but into the greater sense of leadership. Good for business executives and others. By the way, I want to say something. All of our audience members are going to get a copy of my share of the task by general stanley mcchrystal. They will will get to go home with that you just made them very very happy. Before I let you go, I want to say to you personally, no one gets to wear four stars on his shoulder without an extraordinary level of honor and integrity and skill I want to thank you for the service that you rendered to this country I realize every breath of free air I enjoy is because folks like you gave a lifetime of service. Putting your life in danger for people like me. And it is not lost on me that that long career that led to four stars on your shoulder was not an easy one. Thank you. Thank you from the bottom of my heart. 
>> Governor, I'm humbled. 
[ Applause ] 
>> Mike: General stanley mcchrystal the national rifle association says the president's meetings to put an end to gun violence are just a big show. Controversial pick to fill a cabinet position could lead to a showdown of the confirmation hearing. My reaction to the quotes of the week coming up next. 
[ Applause ] ] smile. Like other precious things that start off white, it yellows over time. When it comes to your smile, if you're not whitening, you're yellowing. Crest whitestrips whiten as well as $500 professional treatments. Guaranteed. Crest 3d white whitestrips. to arthritis means living with pain. It could also mean living with joint damage.

[00:34:15]


>> Live from america's news headquarters I am marianne rafferty. Fighting the flu declared an epidemic. People are trying to keep from getting it. Lining for flu shots and people covering their mouth with their hands when putting gas in their tank. 
>> The awards wrapping up moments ago. Daniel day-lewis and hugh jackman for best actor. Jennifer lawrence for best actress. Les mis took home best drama or comedy. 
>> In the championship last week the falcons took home a 28 victory. Ravens in the afc after beating the houston texans tonight 41-28. I am maianne rafferty. For the lathes headlines log on TO foxnews.com. 
>> Mike: Don't forget next week americans are asking to day to pray saturday january 20th. Just a simple day to pray for our nation and leaders regardless of their party or yours. Washington doesn't seem to be listening to us so maybe just maybe they will listen to god there is a link more more information at mike huckabee.Com or go to a day to pray.Com to join others who commit for a day to pray. The debate over the right to bare arms has sparked a heated national discussion. And it's produced a lot of notable quotables this week. New york governor andrew cuomo addressed the issue in his state of the state speech. 
>> It's simple. No one hunts with an assault rifle. No one needs 10 bullets to kill a deer. 
[ Applause ] and too many innocent people have died already. If we are worried about people angry, there you go. Meantime vice president joe biden has been busy meeting with a range of groups about gun control including the nra which released this statement after their meeting with biden. 

[00:36:26]


They said and I quote: We were disappointed with how little this meeting had to do with keeping our children safe how much it who h. To do within amendment to attack the second amendment. The task force spent most of its time on proposed restrictions on lawful firearm owners. Honest tax paying hard working americans. It's unfortunate that this administration continues to insist pushing failed solutions to our nation's most pressing problems end of quote. The gun debate has gotten ooff track. When it talks about you don't need 10 bullets to kill a deer, that's not the point. Folks, it's about protecting yourselves and your families. The second amendment is not to protect your hunting rights. It's to protect you when maybe the police are 30 minutes away. I understand wanting to stop violence. More guns in america past 20 years overall the murder and violence rate is down by half.Think when we talk about maybe we need a background check for everybody, I have got a better idea. Let's have a background check for people who run for office including being president, vice president, senate, congress, whatever. 
[ Applause ] the president nominated chuck hagel to be the next secretary of defense. The pick has faced a lot of criticism because of hagel's controversial comments about israel and iran in the past. One of the people speaking out is former mayor ed koch and he said quote quote. Frankly I thought there would come a time when he would renege speaking of the president when he conveyed on his support of israel comes a little earlier than I thought it would. It very disappointing. I believe he will ultimately regret it koch said and it undoubt ltedly will reduce support for him in the jewish community. I don't think he, the president, worries about that now that the election is over thank you may for candor. We should be concerned about this appointment because of chuck hagel's soft attitude toward iran believing we shouldn't apply sanctions we should have unconditional conversations with these terrorists and somehow if we make nice with them they won't build a bomb and point it at everybody but themselves. At the same time, while we are going soft, senator hagel has been one who has been harsh on israel. I think he has got it mixed up. At least I think so. Finally a source, teacher taking fire on symbolism a little too far. Here is how maggie cope palestinian one of his students described the lesson plan he was teaching its symbols. Cross symbolizes christianity. Then he took the flag I took the flag symbol of america cloth with colors on it and he threw it on the ground and stomped on it. 

[00:39:36]


>> Threw the flag on the ground because it's just a symbol. Just cloth. You know, when general when general mcchrystal sitting here with me and how many times somebody pointed a weapon at him trying to kill him because he was defending that piece of cloth? I didn't think anybody has a right to stomp on it and say it is just a symbol it is a symbol but symbol of something incredibly important to us. A symbol of a nation that has given all of us freedom that we enjoy and the extraordinary lives that he that we get to leave because we are living under that flag. Instead of stomping on it. We ought to pay the highest respect to it and all that it in fact does represent symbolism of great substance and value. While the gun control debate escalates washington and rest of the country. Maybe we ought to be focusing on violence in games in the media at effect it has on disgruntled youth. Russell and sam evans on how we can help young people find a true purpose. And then later, john rich and travis perry jam with the little rockers. A lot more coming right here. Stay with us. flo? is? Are you flo? Yes. Is this the thing you gave my husband? Well, yeah, yes. The "name your p" tool. You tell us the price you want to pay, and we give you a range of options to choose from. Careful, though -- that kind of power can go to your head. At explains a lot. Yo, buddy! I got this. Gimme one, gimme one, gimme one! E power of the "name your price" tool. Only from progressive. Planet shakers rapidly growing youths ministry in australia and getting a worldwide following. Inspires young people to turn off the video games. Get off the couch and focus on a greater cause. Their worship experience looked more like rock concerts but they are very effective in spreading god's message to to thousands. ?????? Pray for awakening inside heart ?????? for he is awesome ?????? our god is awesome. 

[00:44:11]


>> You might feel like you are insignificant any can't you might feel like you are nobody. I'm here to tell is you you god majority every time. 
>> Mike: Next weekend in san diego planet shakers will be holding their very first conference in the united states. Ou please welcome pastor russell evans and his wife sam evans. 
[ Applause ] 
>> thank you guys for being here. 
>> Nice being here. 
>> You said back in 2008 that we need a generation consumed by god's presence, get off the x box 360 and the playstations. Get off the couch. That's a pretty provocative message. 
>> People have been isolated by just doing video games. I believe that young people are a great people who can make a difference in our society. They can contribute to the life of society in a powerful way. If we can get young people having a vision for their life and getting young people not just consumed with a box that gets them into a fantasy land but take them into a place be community to make a difference in their schools and universities, go on missions trips, to be a part of churches and other groups, then they will start living beyond themselves and not living selfish existence but an existence that's greater and impact grateful for the community. 
>> Mike: The idea of people connecting with each other. Social scientists are saying a lot of people are so tied to their electronic devices that they don't have any community with people no touch, no feel. Is that what you are trying to break loose with young people and say look, you have got to talk with people can skin on? 
>> Absolutely. You know, these young people that we see today are lost. They don't have a vision for their lives. That's what we want to restore. We want to get people as russell said to get out of that fan stacy world and get into reality but also to see the significance of themselves, the gifts, the abilities that they can effect their world for the greater and so that's what we want to stair stir up in planet shakers you can make a difference. Come on young person, can you do it. 

[00:46:27]


>> I love the planet shers. It really does sort of indicate that you are asking young people to do something that is going to shake up the world. You know, most young people i know, they want to shake up their parents. 
[ Laughter ] u. Are giving them a bigger vision than that shake up the whole world. Peace corps. We incourage people to do something unselfish. That's a way where you are going with planet shakers. This generation millennials want to do something. They want to be a part of a cause to change the world. Make poverty history. 
>> Into different aspects of society and be the answer and not be the problem. I think if we give young people a vision, you know, and see what they can be, and see what they can do. Literally, we can change this world. We can shake the planet. For the good and not for the bad. 
>> You guys have children of their own. How do you help your kids disconnect from electric tonics and all of the devices that can enslave them and to become what your hoping all these young people will become? 
>> Yeah. I think it's with my children they have some devices that they play from time to time. But we have in our family you can't be consumed with it. It's not to be the whole part of your life. Let it be enjoyment for an hour or so. Not go beyond that. Get involved in life and youth group and church. I remember my son saying i want to be the next lebron james. And playing nba. He said I want to become the next lebron james. I said how do you become the next lebron? He said how dad? I said get out on the court and shoot shoot shoot, run run run it's called w-o-r-k. Work. We want to get young people activated because they have got energy and vibrancy and with our children I think them being involved in our local youth group has been such a great thing. Involved with the outreach programs involved with the worship ministry and seeing them flourish and really go beyond what we actually could see. We are really proud of what they are doing. 

[00:48:44]


>> Shepard: That's exciting. I'm looking forward to what ought to be a great weekend next weekend in san diego. Planet shaker. 
[Applause] 
>> Mike: Thanks so much for being here. 
>> Thank you. 
>> A real honor having you. John rich and travis perryjoining us again to what may one of john's biggest hits. You don't want to miss this. from Is bigger than we think ... like the flu. With aches, fever and chills- the flu's a really big deal. So why treat it like it's a little cold? There's something that works differently than over-the-counter remedies. Prescription TAMIFLU attacks the flu virus at its source. So don't wait. Call your doctor right away.

>> do you love god? I knew that was what you were going to say. If you ask the average person on the street, do you love god, they're probably going to say the same thing, yes, I do. If you ask them to describe the god that they love, you would be absolutely shocked at what some people would say. There's a lot of people who think they love god, they don't know him. A lot of people think they love god that have been saved but when it comes to loving him, they don't really love him. They don't understand that. They don't realize that but they don't. So I would ask you this simple question. What characteristics are there in your life when somebody sees you and watches you, they would see by your lifestyle that you love god. And I would ask you the question, when you look for characteristics in other people what do you look for? That indicate that that person loves god. There's a lot of mistaken ideas about loving god and love in general. In fact, a lot of people don't know how to love anybody. They wish they did, but they don't. And the tragedy is many people will live their entire life never feeling loved. And many people will live their entire life never knowing how to love someone else. Love is a major issue with god. It should be a major issue in all of our lives. But it's a four-letter word we say a lot about. We call it love. It can be many other things. But love is a big deal with god. And when you look at the scriptures and look at what jesus said, how he refers to the old testament where love fit in god's big plan for the nation of israel and all of us, you'll see how very important it is. I want you to turn to the 22nd chapter of matthew. And what's happening here is that the pharisees have been challenging jesus and as soon as they finish, thecripture says 

[00:08:13]


the sadducees, they took their turn in arguing with jesus. I want us to read this passage to sort of set the tone for what we want to say here. Beginning in the 34th verse of matthew 22. But when the pharisees heard jesus had silenced the sadducees, they gathered themselves together. One of them, a lawyer asked him a question. Testing him. Teacher, which is the great commandment and the law? Not which was but which is, what is it now? Teacher, what is the great commandment in the law? And he said to him, you shall love the lord your god with all your heart, with all your soul and with all your mind. This is the great and foremost commandment. The second is like it. You shall love your neighbor as yourself. On these two commandments depend the whole law and the prophets. So what jesus did, he sent them all the way back to deuteronomy which they of course were familiar with, I'm sure. Deuteronomy sixth chapter. I want you to turn there for a moment. This is a very important passage of scripture to the nation of israel. It should be a very important passage to all of us because of what god includes in what he says very clearly in this particular passage. Beginning in chapter six of deuteronomy verse one. Now this is the commandment, the statutes and the judgments which the lord is your god has commanded me to teach you that you might do them in the land which you're going over to possess it. They're on their way to the promised land. He's preparing them to know how to live and their relationship to god especially among a group of heathen people. So he says, so that you and your son and your grandson might fear the lord, your god, to keep all his statutes and his commandments which I command you all the days of your life. And that your days maybe prolonged. He said, if you obey me, walk according to these, god will bless you in a very unusual way. 

[00:10:17]


You shall listen and be careful to do it that it may be well with you and that you may multiply greatly just as the lord, the god of your fathers has promised you. In a land flowing with milk and honey. Then he says again, hear o israel, the lord is our god. The lord is one. You shall love the lord your god with all your heart. With all your soul. With all your might. These words which I am commanding you today shall be on your heart. Now, watch this. He said, these are so important you shall teach them diligently to your sons. And shall talk of them when you sit in your house. When you walk by the way. And when you lie down. And when you rise up. You shall bind them as a sign on your hand and they shall be as frontlets on your forehead. You shall write them on the doorpost of your house and on your gates. Now, think about this. This is so important, above everything else, our love for god is singularly the most important thing. It should be a part of not only your life but the life of your family, teaching it to your sons, and actually to the daughters. And that every member of your family, every day you would be conscious of the love that god has for you and your love for him. Because he said, when you sit down you're talking about it. When you're standing up you're talking about it. When you're walking by the way you're talking about it. Isn't that the way we should raise our families. During the day we're talking about the lord whether we're sitting, standing, working, playing. Jesus christ should be foremost in our thinking all the time because he's first and foremost in our life. When he said we're to love him with all of our heart all of our soul all of our mind, what did he mean by that? Simply this. Our heart for example is like our innermost being. 

[00:12:18]


This is who we are. Our soul is our emotional being. And our mind is like our mental capacity. So he's simply saying with your whole being, your mind, your heart, your soul, your body, all of it. We should be expressing love towards him continually. When we're expressing love towards god, what we're doing, we're acknowledging not only that he's our heavenly father, but we are giving of ourselves to him totally and completely for his purpose to bring him joy. We're loving him. That's what we're doing. We're giving ourselves to him his joy. When he's loving us, he is continually uring out his blessing and his love towards us. What he's doing, he's pouring out his goodness upon us in order to do what? That we might see his good purposes in our life. And that we might fulfill his purpose and bring him honor and glory. And at the same time that he likewise would benefit us. So there's this beautiful two-way relationship that god intends for us to have for him. The tragedy is most people will live their lives and never love god because they don't know how. They think they are loving him, they don't know how to love him. They don't know if they're loving him or no and they go through life missing out on the awesome experience of loving god and being able to experience that love themselves. So I want to ask you today, do you love him? Well, some of you say you do. I think all the rest of you think you do. Probably, I'm not saying you don't, but by the time the message is over, you may discover about yourself what i discovered about myself. There came a time in my life when I realized that I didn't love him. I thought I did and I would have said, absolutely. How would I be preaching the gospel if I didn't love god? But sometimes we mistake other things for loving him. Well, I want you to see that god 

[00:14:20]


began in his teaching in the nation of israel that loving god with all of their might, with all of their strength he says, all of their soul, all of their being, all of their emotions, this is number one above all the rest. When you looked at these laws and the promises of god and the things he had asked him to do, there was 600 and some laws. And they were saying to him, what is the most important one? And he was saying, this is it. You should love the lord your god with all your heart, with all your soul, with all your strength, with all your mind. With every part of every faculty you have should be expressed towards him. I would simply ask you this. How many times in any given day or any given week do you think about how much you love him? Don't we usually talk about how much we want him to love us? And we talk about how we love god in a way but deep down inside it's very difficult to grasp what we really mean, if you say I love god, let's put it this way. If you say I love my wife, there's a lot of emotion behind that. A lot of meaning behind that. If you say I love my brother. If you love a friend. There's feelings behind that. They all have meanings behind it. When you say you love god, what do you mean? So I want us to look at this for a moment. I think a lot of people think they do. In their heart, they mean to, but do they? Really and truly love him? I would ask you this question again. That is, what characteristics would you look for in a person who says he loves god? What do you think otople are looking for when they look at your life? You and I say we love them. What do they see? What are they looking for in our lives that indicate we genuinely 

[00:16:20]


love god? If you say you love your son or daughter, you put your arm around them but loving god is a whole different situation. Let's think about it for a moment. There's misconceptions about loving god. And there's sort of honest misconceptions but they're misconceptions. I may say I love god when i really mean I fear him. I have a reverence for him. Listen to this. Reverencing god isn't loving god. And reverence means I'm honoring him for who he is, I'm acknowledging I'm in the presence of holy god, almighty god. That doesn't mean I love him. You say, why isn't reverence love? It's not love. I may reverence him because i recognize who he is. And the fact he's holy and that he's just and one day he'll judge me. That is, I can think of a lot of reasons for being reverent towards god without loving him at all. That doesn't necessarily make me give of myself to him heart soul mind and body. When I feel his presence, i acknowledge his presence. So sometimes it's a matter of thinking we love himhen the truth is, we're just fearing him. A second mistake we make is, we feel needy. And oftentimes, we confuse needing him with loving him. All of us have a need of him. We have a need of him in every aspect of our life. So if I need him, naturally I'll call upon him. And if I need him, I'll be expressing my concerns. I may say god I love you. I wonder oftentimes if instead of really loving him we're not being needy and we want some kind of intimacy or relationip or feeling that makes my need go away. That's not necessarily loving god. So I would ask you the question. Do you really and truly love him? Or is it that you have this needy feeling? And do you feel in your heart 

[00:18:22]


that, for example, why do we pray? Most of the time our prayers are because we, for example, have some need and so we come to him and ask him for whatever that need may be. And the truth is, it's not loving him. We're needing him. So sometimes it's fearing him, reference, sometimes it's needing him. Sometimes it's serving him. Now you would say, I wouldn't serve god if I didn't love him. Yes, you would. There's people who get lots of joy and satisfaction out of doing something religious because it makes them feel good, it makes them feel accepted. It makes them feel they're doing something for someone else. It gives them a sense of satisfaction. And it gives them a sense, for example, to be able to express their views of things. And also their particular spiritual gifts. That's not necessarily loving god. Because oftentimes people who supposed to be serving him would find themselves totally out of the will of god. They're not serving god. They're just serving themselves and what they like doing. So it's easy to be mistaken when it comes to true genuine loving god. So you have to ask yourself the question, why do I do the things I do? Why do I feel the things I feel? And so, oftentimes, a person would say, well, surely if I'm giving to god, I love him. Well, I would like to think that's true but it's not always true. Because, for example, if you grew up believing what the bible teaches about tithing so every sunday you give your tithe because that's what you've been taught to do. You do it because that's what you've been taught to do. You love god. You look forward to every sunday being able to express one area of love by giving to him that other people may hear the gospel and know the lord jesus christ as their personal savior. So what motivates our giving? If you're motivated to give by love then you give with joy. 

[00:20:23]


And here's how you can tell the difference. If you're motivated by love, you don't have to every week say okay, how much will I give this week? Have I got enough to give god after I spent what I want? That's not loving god. Loving god is you put his first. And loving god means that that's just the part of my relationship to him. That I love, one of the ways i can express love is I can express love. I know the heart of god is to reach other people t. Heart of god to see people saved. The hard of god is to draw people to him. Whatever I can do to draw people to him I know that's my expression of my love for god. Is it my giving? Is my giving an expression of love? Anyone of these things could be but oftentimes they are misconceptions for genuine giving of myself heart, soul, mind and body for his purposes to bring him glory and to bring him honor. What we have to ask is this. A good test for my love is this. Whatever I'm doing, what's the purpose? What's the motivation? And the motivation should always be for his purpose, for his glory and for his honor. That is, you and I bring joy to the heart of god when we express love to him. Whatever it may be. It may be singing the gospel, teaching the gospel, preaching it, sharing it, whatever it might be. Which brings me to another issue here and that is, oftentimes we think, if I'm sharing my testimony or teaching or something, surely I must be loving god. Not necessarily. And sometimes people do certain religious acts because they feel obligated. And if I preach a very strong sermon about you ought to go out and witness, ought to go out and share your faith and get under conviction and say I better tell people about jesus. The pastor will ask me. If I don't, I'll feel bad. That's not loving god. 

[00:22:23]


That's getting rid of guilt. You have to ask yourself the question, how much of what I do, how much of what you do is an expression of genuine love for god. The reason it's so important is he said to the nation of israel before they went into the promised land, look, I want you to remember this above everything else. You shall love the lord your god with all your heart, all your soul, with all your mind. Every faculty you have is uppermost, foremost in your life. That's first. Whatever is first. Then the sadducees, the pharisees, they thought they had him. He said it's real simple. Go back in deuteronomy and read the passage you know yourself already. Love the lord your god with all your heart, all your soul, all your mind. It's a vital part of our life. I think oftentimes, we think about praying to god. We think about lots of things. But loving him. Somebody said how do I love god? We talked about that in a second. In essence it's simply this. We live out our day for his purpose, for his glory, giving of ourselves to him and our minds how we think, our emotions how we feel. And as we think about our expressions of our daily life with other people. You're showing love towards god when you're loving other people, and you show love towards god when you're forgiving other people. You're showing love to god when you're serving him, that is, you're motivated and acting on the basis of your genuine love for him. There's some things I'm sure i just like yourself we do because we love him. Not because we like doing it or love doing it but because we love him. We know it brings joy to the heart of god. Ever met anybody tt's it's very difficult to forgive? Right? Amen. But you did it anyway. Because you knew it was the right thing to do. It was the proper thing to do. It was the godly thing to do. And those who saw you forgive 

[00:24:25]


knew you were acting in a godly fashion, because that's what the lord would have you do. We love not necessarily because we feel like it but we're expressing the heart of god. When we express the heart of god something begins to happen in our heart also. That's why when a person gives a testimony about god a good place to start is with the lord jesus christ whom he said of himself, if you've seen me, you've seen the father. You want to know who the father is? I and the father is one. I'm in you. You're in me. I'm in the father. Therefore, you're in the father. Jesus and the father, this oneness. So when people say, listen. I love god. Now jesus, I don't want anything to do with this jesus. I love god. You can't have it this way. That's like saying I want him but I don't want him. He said I and the father are one. Therefore, when a person loves god, they'll love his son. Listen. How can you say to your husband or wife. Let's say you reject your husband. No. You don't reject the person you love. You don't reject something you love. Very important. Because god knew that of all the things he could teach them, if they learned to put loving him first and foremost, everything else would change. Now we might considethe question, why don't people love god? Well number one, they don't know him. That's the reason they don't know who he is as we've said. And secondly, they fear him. That is, they're afraid of god. They've heard all these things about god being a god of judgment and so they're afraid of him. Thirdly, he makes them uncomfortable. That is, when people are living in sin, they're uncomfortable talking about god. Or sometimes they'll say, you know, I just don't like to mix god with the rest of my life. You know, that reminds me when i first was here, associate 

[00:26:26]


pastor, and there was seven men who sort of ran the church and made the decisions but I did sit in on the meetings. I'll never forget this as long as I live. We were discussing something and they couldn't make a decision. So I said, well, and I was just associate pastor. I said why don't we pray about it? This attorney sitting a little bit to my right said, this is business. Leave god out of this, well, that began a war between me and the rest of the whole crowd. But anyway, that was his thinking. Leave god out of this. You can't leave god out of anything. When you trust the lord jesus christ as your savior, listen, everything gets wrapped up in your relationship to him and how you respond so it makes them very uncomfortable. Let me ask you this. When you start loving god, what happened to your lifestyle? Changed. You stopped drinking, i certainly hope. You stopped using profanity. You stopped telling dirty jokes or listening to them. You watched what you read, saw, listened to. In other words, your life changed. When a person doesn't want a life change they don't want anything to do with god. When you think people who are very kind and so forth but when it comes to spiritual things, that's enough. I don't want to talk about that. It makes them uncomfortable. They think about god. They think about all the things you don't do. That's not who god is. Baptists probably have the worst reputation. If you're a baptist, I remember growing up if you're a baptist you don't drink, you don't smoke, you don't dance, you don't play cards, you couldn't even play old maid. You couldn't do anything. That's the reputation. The truth is, it's not what we don't do. It's who we love. It's who we love that makes a difference in the lifestyle we live. If a person doesn't want to live a godly lifestyle, they don't want to talk about him anduss him. They want to leave him out of the conversation. 

[00:28:29]


It inhibits people's conduct. Isn't it interesting during these days of all in all this. Don't put god in all this, this is politics. You can't leave god out of anything no matter what it is. People have to understand that. Then, of course, it makes them feel very uncertain about the future. him, if they reject the lord jesus christ as their savior, they don't want to talk about dying. They can't deny they're going to. They have no certainty about anything. Lots of uncertainty. And they hear about god's judgment and say, well, do you know what? T want to talk about that. I don't want to believe in a god who does the following things and all of that. And the truth is, they don't want to talk about it, because they know that one of these days they're going to die. They have no idea what will happen. All they know about god is he's a god of judgment. There's a hell and so forth. So they don't want to talk aboutapprch somebody like that, you have to approach them in a loving way and help them realize, listen, god isn't just a god of justice. He's a god of love. Why did he send jesus? He sent jesus because he loves us, he cares for us. And so people just have a distorted view of what god is like. And why theyonm. And so I think one of the primary reasons I've found, one of the most difficult reasons is this. When a person has had a circumstance in their life, they can't explain it. For example, he may say, my wife was killed three weeks after we were married. What kind of god is that? My baby died at the age of two. What kind of god is that? How could god let a whole bus load of people have a wreck and 20 people die and the otr 1 not? How can god have a plane crash and everybody be killed? 

[00:30:30]


How can a whole ship sink and everybody be lost? How can god let all these wars take place and all these men suffer loss of arms and legs? If god is love where is all the love? It's where it's always been. See god's love doesn't stop sin. God's love doesn't prohibit us from sin. And so, just because I don't understand some things doesn't mean that I'm not to love god or can't love him or he doesn't love me. Because all of us who are believers realize there are times in our lives when things happen. We don't understand. Maybe brings pain or hurt or sorrow, then later on in life we see, god, now I see what you were doing. And the thing we may have criticized god for here. Later on we look back and say thank you, dear god. Thank you, thank you, thank you that you allowed this and this and this. You changed my whole life. You changed my attitude. You changed my perspective. All these things happen because god doesn't make mistakes and god loves us continuously for his purpose and to benefit us. So therefore people don't love him for lots of reasons. You have to ask yourself the question, is there anything that's happened in your life that made you, maybe for a little season period of time say, I hate god for this reason? I've heard people say, I hate god. Why do you hate him? Because of what he's done. Isn't something god's done. He has all power? He has all power. Why did he let it happen? I can't answer why he let everything happen. This I do know. He has a definite, watch this. Whatever he allows to happen, he has a definite loving purpose ultimately. I may not understand it. I may not like it. He knows I want. He knows you want. He doesn't expect us to. Listen. He loves us so much he'll let us hurt for our good even though he knows it hurts us. God is an awesome god. And when we don't love him, 

[00:32:31]


we're the losers. Remember. The more we're able to love him, the more we're able to perceive and receive and experience the awesome gift of god's love in our life. And so, he made a major issue of love in this particular passage and also in that passage in deuteronomy. It's interesting that he said, of all the commandments, and we have ten commandments. But what about this one? He said, you shall love the lord your god with all your heart, soul, mind. And he says, and your neighbor as yourself. And without that first one, the second one would never happen. And probably the second one maybe more difficult than the first one. But I can't love, somebody says, do you love everybody the same way? I don't think so. It's easier to love some people than it is others. They make themselves obnoxious sometimes. You have to work at loving some people. Because they don't love themselves. They don't know how to love you. But we have to be lovers no matter what. And the most important thing is, what characteristics are there in our life? What is going on in our daily life? People know we're somebody who loves god. That will make the deepest, strongest impression than anything else we do. We might ask the question, why should we love him? Why should I love a god I can't see? Why should I love a god I can't touch and can't feel? Why should I love a god I can't see and hear? Why should I love that kind of god? There's a reason. Isn't it interesting that so many religions have gods that they've made. The bible talks about that. They're deaf. They're dumb. They can't walk. 

[00:34:32]


They can't speak. Yet people worship them. We have the only one true god. And he's made himself very real in the person of jesus christ. And so, when I think about god and who he is and what he's like and why we should love him, i would say the first reason is because he created us. Listen. If he hadn't created you, you wouldn't be here. And somebody says, I was an accident. No, you weren't an accident either. God is sovereign of this universe. I was not wanted. God wanted you or he wouldn't have let you be born. And so, god created you. He gave you life. And so one of the reasons we should be loving him is because he's the reason we're here. So he's our creator. Secondly, one of the second reasons we should love him is this. Look what he did. God was, listen, god was so interested in you and me understanding what he's like and who he is, and what he's really like and what, who he really is totally. Here's what he did. He's so interested in that and also the fact you and I could be forgiven of our sins and one of these days when we die we don't have to worry about where we're going. He sent his only begotten son jesus into the world. Why did he send him? Two reasons primarily. Number one, he wanted us to know him in a deeper way than the old testament saints knew him. They knew god primarily as the creator, as the sovereign of the universe, the one who held everything in his hands. But the intimacy that you and i have with jesus and the father, they didn't quite have it like that. I'm not saying they all didn't. Certainly if you read the psalms and intimacy god had, he was the god of justice, holiness, righteousness. Ark of the covenant. Don't touch this. Don't touch that. Don't go in here. This separates us. Their idea of god was so vastly 

[00:36:32]


different than ours. What did he do? The bible says that jesus came. He said if you've seen me, you've seen the father. I and the father are one. They didn't get that. The pharisees wanted to crucify him for claiming to be god. He said if you've seen me you've seen the father. The father and I are one. Jesus christ the son of god. God the father, god the son, god the holy spirit makes up the trinity which is the godhead which is one. He loved us enough, listen, living out a life unequaled by any life that's ever been lived. Not only living out that life but then being willing to lay it down. To be willing to die in order that you and I could be forgiven of our sins. And that you and I could have a personal intimate relationship with god through his son jesus christ. And people who say to you, well, I believe in god but don't give me that jesus stuff. What they're saying is, i believe in your god, but I don't really want him. Because the only way to come to him is through his son. I and the father are one. And so he loved us enough to show us what life is like. What the father is like. A loving father. Forgiveness of sins. And listen. He chose the most powerful method of expressing love ever known to man. And that is, when he crucified his only begotten son. The greatest expression of love ever known to man, could ever be known to man. And he didn't do it because any of us deserved it but simply because he loved us. And so, why should we love him? Because he created us. And because, he was crucified for us. He went to the cross for us. And then, something else I want you to see for a moment. And that is, I want you to jot these down when we put them on the board. I want you to think about the commitments that god has made to every single one of his children. You talk about motivation for love. These commitments are motivation for us to love god. 

[00:38:33]


So I'm going to give you all of these. Here's one of his commitments. I'll never leave you nor forsake you. No one else can promise you that. No one else can. There may be some who would like to but can't. I'll never leave you or forsake you under any condition. To be able to wake up every morning and know we wake up with a father. We go to bed with him. We wake up with him. Holy spirit living with us all day equipping us to do what god wants us to do. Look at that commitment. I'll never leave you or forsake you. If that shouldn't motivate our love for god. Secondly he said something else nobody else can promise. He said I'll supply all your needs. That is, whatever I call you to do, I'm going to supply your need. And you know that passage in philippians that paul made so familiar to us. He says, I'll supply all your needs according to his riches in glory, which means, according to his supply which is always unlimited. Who can promise to meet all your needs? You say, I have this need. Listen. You have emotional needs, psychological needs, on and on we could go, material needs. He said I'll meet all your needs. Who can promise you that? Only god. Why shouldn't I love this god who is so committed he'll never leave me or forsake me under any condition? He'll always be there for me whatever the supply may be. Thirdly he said I'll answer your prayers. Ask and it will be given to you, seek and you will find. Knock and it will be opened. Ask anything in my name and I'll do it. Certain conditions to that. I'll answer your prayers. All of us have been in situations where only god could make that provision. Only god could change that circumstance. And that's who he says he is and that's what he does in our life. When you think about loving him, my, my, what does it take to get a person to love god who has such, listen, these are divine commitments. It's one thing for me to say 

[00:40:34]


here's what he'll do for you. It's something else for the creator of the universe to say you can bet your life on this, eternal life on this, I'll never leave you. Never forsake you. Never lie to you and keep my every single promise. Only god can do it. Then I think about how many times has he forgiven us of our sins? Can't count them. Let me ask you a question. How many times have you ever been to god and confessed something and god said, I'm not going to do it. I'm not forgiving you of that. That's too bad. I'm not forgiving you. You can't name one. He may read your insincerity. That may be one thing. But if you and I ask him to forgive us, he said if we confess our sins, watch this, he's faithful, watch the next word. Faithful, which means you can always count on him. And just which means he has a right to forgive you. How does he have a right to forgive you? The scripture says the soul that sins shall die. How shall he forgive me of my sin because it will take me out? Jesus took our place on the cross. That makes it right for god to forgive sinners for their sin even though they sinned against god. Because he's already paid the price. So he said, if we confess our sins he's faithful and just to forgive us and cleanse us from all unrighteousness. Who can forgive you of your sin? Someone can forgive you for what you've done to them but they can't forgive you for god? Think about this. He didn't just put us down here to do our best. He gave every single one of us a spiritual gift one or more gifts. When you trusted him as your savior, watch this, this is awesome. The holy spirit came to indwell you. The holy spirit came to indwell you, listen, in order to express 

[00:42:36]


thugh you the spiritual gift or gifts that god's given you in order to enable you do well whatever god has called you to do. Whether it's to be a godly mother in a home or whether it's to be a doctor or carpenter. Whatever it might be. A secretary. A nurse. Whatever. In other words, god equips us. He gives us spiritual gift. People have gift of service, exhortation, administration and on and on the bible goes. Seven major primary gifts. He's gifted every single one of us to do more than one gift in order that you and I could do our work and do it well. He hasn't left us alone to work it out by ourselves. Think about it. He's not only created you and equipped you. He's made it possible for you to live your life and make it productive. And fruitful. Listen. I think everyone should want to COME TO TjE END OF THEIR LOVE And look back and not ask the question, where did it go? What did I do? How has it all gone? Why is it a waste? You want to come to tend of your life and look back and know in your heart you did your best to live a life that was godly. That you wanted to spend your life and invest your life so the people who left behind, listen, because they're better because you were there. Closer to god because you're there. Knew more about god because you were there. Your life is making a difference. I can't imagine coming to a place in life and looking back and not seeing anything but a big zero. That is, to come to the end of life and think, do you know what? It would be the same if I hadn't lived. The fruit of my life is a zero. What a horrible way to die to think whatever the disease, it would never equal the hurt and the pain of thinking your life was one big waste. And then of course, I think about how he fills us with the spirit. Those spiritual gifts, those spiritual gifts come with the presence of the holy spirit. That is, you and I have a 

[00:44:38]


promise he'll enable us through the power of the spirit to live out those gifts and execute them in a way that's pleasing and honorable to god. Then of course, one of these commits he's made. Listen, he's made a commitment to you and me that he's prepared a place in heaven for us. He said I'm going to prepare a place for you. If I go to prepare a place for you I'll receive you to myself that where I am, there you'll be also. That's a commitment. It's one thing for someone to say one of these days so and so. When jesus says, one of these days you're going to die. And I want you to know that i already have a place in heaven for you. A commitment. Nobody else can make that commitment. And when people say, I don't believe in god, I think how foolish. I don't believe in jesus. How foolish. Only jesus can say, I've gone to heaven to prepare a place for you. If I go to prepare a place for you, I'll come to receive you to myself where I am there you'll be also. Who can make that kind of commitment? Nobody. Think of all the commitments. Not only that. He promises us he'll give us a resurrected body. You've been living all these years. Don't like the way you look. Don't like the way you particular have to see yourself. One of these days it will all be good. 33 years old and absolutely beautiful. You say that wouldn't be true? Let me ask you does god create things that aren't perfect? I don't think so. Heaven will be ultimate in power of almighty god listen who is expressing his love towards us while we're here. Imagine what it will be like for him to express his love towards us when there's no inhibitions, none. No body faults. Whatever it might be. Everything will be perfect. Who can promise that? A resurrected body. Who can promise heaven? Who can promise eternal life? Only god. Just look at that list of commitments and ask yourself the question, why should I love him? Look at all these reasons i 

[00:46:38]


should love him. Then I would say one other thing and that is, because, I think to me this is the most important. Because you and I can have a personal, intimate relationship with god through his son jesus. Which means there's no relationship to equal him. Not brothers and sisters, nothing, there is no relationship to a personal intimate relationship with his son jesus christ. That's a commitment he's made to every single one of us who will come to him through his son jesus christ through the cross at calvary and embrace him as he embraces us and make us one with him as he desires to be one with us. There's nothing in life to match that. I don't know what that means. You'll never know what it means until jesus is your savior and you begin to pursue him not only as your savior but lord and master for your very life. When we really and truly fall in love with him they'll be things very evident. I want to give you another list. The list you'll remember not if I just say it. So if you love him, here's what you'll strive to do. Number one, they're all there. Number one, you'll desire to obey him. If you love him, you'll want to obey him no matter what's going on. Doesn't mean you always will but that's your heart's desire. Secondly, you'll want to serve him. You won't want to waste your life, spend your life, but you'll want to do something in some way to serve the lord. Likewise, you want to share. You don't want to keep it to yourself. You want to tell somebody else about him. I don't know how anybody cannot want to when we go to the restaurant to eat it's hard for me to wait to find out what the 

[00:48:38]


person believes or where they're from and just, you can always say, you have a beautiful smile, whatever it might be. Next thing you know you're in a conversation and you can finally get around to jesus pretty quickly. So far for the most part nobody has ever said I don't want to talk about him because they want a good tip. I do understand that. And what I found out though is being a pastor of a large church tip has to be pretty good size. They don't understand. You want to share him. Then likewise you're going to trust him. If you love him you'll trust him. You'll want to fellowship with him. You want to spend time with him, being quiet, listening to him. Letting him love you and loving him in return. Worship him. Sometimes that may be singing, sometimes it may be being quiet and just talking to him or listening to him quietly. But you want to worship him. You want to acknowledge he's the god of this universe, sovereign god of the universe and god who loves you with a love that's absolutely indescribable. Of course, you want to give to him. I can't imagine coming to church and not giving god anything after he's done all the things I've just mentioned and remember this. The list I just gave you, listen, these aren't things that happen intermittently. Constant with god. I'll never leave you or forsake you. Time comes resurrected body. In heaven preparing a place for you. These are absolute, divine commitments god's made. How could I ever hesitate about giving him anything. Then of course you want to defend him. When somebody uses foul language with god I want to say he's my friend. In other words, we should defend the gospel. We should defend our faith in god. Defend our faith in jesus christ if we love him, we will defend him. If somebody offended you about your wife or son or daughter, you would want to defend them. I don't mean you would get in a fist fight but you would want to 

[00:50:40]


defend the fact they're precious to you and you would rather not have that kind of situation. And surely if you love him you'll meditate on his word. This is how a heart gets full and faith gets filled up and we become strong in the things of god when we begin to meditate on the word of god and see him in ways we never see him before. Then there's one other way that we will be willing to do. We'll be willing to suffer for him. If we really and truly love him, we're willing to suffer for him if necessary. Loving god is the most important thing we do. So would you say that you love him? You say, I'm not even a christian. It's pretty evident you don't. I would say this. No matter what you do in life, no matter how successful the world may see you and everything you participate in, if you don't have the love of god you'll never be happy, satisfied, contented. You'll never be able to accumulate enough wealth, popularity, prosperity, anything else. Because god made you, he made you to love him. So he could love you. And work in your life the things that prosper you. But also bring him glory and honor. I want to invite you to ask him to forgive you of your sins. That's the beginning step. Ask him to forgive you of your sins. Without christ, you're lost. You have no relationship to god. You don't understand. Listen. You'll never understand who god is until jesus becomes a vital part of your life. Then all of a sudden everything begins to change. And so I would invite you to ask him to forgive you of your sins based on what he did at the cross. Surrender your life to him and let god change your life and begin to reveal to you this awesome god. Who has committed to you everything we've just mentioned all the days of your life.

And having heard it, we are launched into the greatest, most exciting adventure we could ever imagine. >> Come with us as we celebrate god's faithfulness through the years and learn how to live in freedom through christ. >> When you and I have the love of god within our hearts, let me ask you, when is it going to run out? It's not ever going to run out. When he says love never fails does that mean ultimately if i love somebody, finally I will conquer them? No. Here's what it means ultimately. That no matter what's going on and how long it goes on, no matter what troubles us and trials and heartaches we face, no matter what people say, what they do to us, he says, the proper response is always love. That never fails. It never fails. You see, because if my response to difficulty and heart ship and trial or abuse whatever it might be, if my response is always to love the other person, here's what that means. Watch this now. That means that no matter what they do, I am still a free man. Because I don't allow them to imprison me with my bitterness and resentment and anger and hostility. And unforgiving spirit. And if I should ask you do you want to be free or in prison? 

[00:56:43]


Everybody wants to be free. My friend, if you want to be free, the love of god must flow in your heart. Where does it begin? This is where it begins. It begins with you placing your trust in christ as your personal savior and having your sins forgiven. And when you trust jesus christ as your personal savior, and what you're saying is, I do believe what he did at the cross atoned for my sin, paid my sin debt in full and I receive him as my personal savior for forgiveness of my sins, then the love of god begins to flow in your life. Because the spirit of god comes to take up abode and he begins to flow and allows that love to flow in your life. Do you know what happens? All of life begins to change. You have the capacity now to walk in the freedom that only love can provide. Where love is missing, there is no freedom. Where love is present, there is an awesome power within you to walk above what life may throw at you. And I believe that he wants us all to be walking, fountains of love. His love flowing, overflowing in us and through us to other people who are hurting all around us. And somehow when I'm giving myself away to someone else, I'm not thinking about me. And when I've given myself away to someone else, the love of god is so flowing through us, we don't feel we've given away because the love of god is continually replenishing all that we give. Love is the eternal gift of god. That keeps us the free children of god. Which brings him the glory that he's seeking. >> Announcer: Touching the world with a passion for god and compassion for people, in touch with dr.

>> Curt: Time for our broken city player of the game and it is falcon quarterback matt ryan. Three touchdown passes and a crucial game-winning drive with under 25 seconds to go to lead to the winning field goal and take the falcons into the nfc championship game. Well, the falcons had a big 20-0 halftime lead. It looked like it was over but of course they were trailing at the ending. Still a happy locker room even though it was a hard-fought victory. 

[00:02:16]


>> Obviously we didn't play our best in the second half. We did it though, we got the things done, we finished. That's right. We said we're going to finish everything we do, we did that today. I can't tell you how proud I am. Let's make sure, all right, that we take care of the next couple of days, all right. Victory monday. Off on tuesday. Come in on wednesday and get ready for the san francisco 49ers, GUYS. 
>> Curt: Tempered enthusiasm but enthusiasm nonetheless, right? 
>> Terry:11 snaps, 48 yards in the fourth quarter, they had to punt twice and had an interception. That was the atlanta falcons offense. Then with 25 seconds left, like you said, it was 41 yards on two plays and then the game-winning field goal. So they get it done when they have to get it done. And you heard mike smith talk, howie, you can't allow in this game a big lead to dissipate like that. You've got to go ahead and close the deal. 
>> Curt: So atlanta will host the nfc championship game next sunday against the san francisco 49ers. When we come back, we'll break down that matchup as tty ice and company are one game away from the super bowl. Before we go to break, a reminder, don't miss beyonce and the pepsi super bo xlvii halftime show kicked off by the world's first-ever fan sourced intro starring fans like you.

>> Curt: So the nfc championship game is set. Next sunday the san francisco 49ers WILL TAKE ON THE ATLANTA Falcons. 
>> Just one more game, one more chance to prove you're the conference king. One more opportunity to silence the doubters. And one more test before a shot at the ultimate prize. Next week, the nfc's top two seeds face off for a trip to the super bowl. As for the niners, a whole year has passed with one clear thought in mind. Redemption. 
>> The new york giants have it, incredible! 
>> But this time they have a new dynamic quarterback ready to prove his place as the team's true starter. 
>> Colin kaepernick, what a game! 
>> Hosting this matchup are the atlanta falcons, who are coming off their first playoff win in eight long years. This features a wide range of stars, including a quarterback on the verge of joining the league's elite. 
>> Whoa, I don't know if they have got a coverage for that one. 
>> And a future hall of famer, ready to round out his career with the coveted lombardi trophy. 
>> What a catch! Touchdown, tony gonzalez! 
>> It's the niners and the falcons battling for the nfc crown, next week on fox. 
>> Curt: During the regular season, they finished as the top two seeds in the nfc so seeding holding to form here. The falcons next week will host san francisco. Take a look ahead seven days for me, jimmy. 
>> Jimmy: Atlanta will have their hands full with this san francisco team. Mobile quarterbacks have given them problems. Today russell wilson, 445 yards and three touchdowns. Against cam newton in two games, over 00 yards, six touchdowns. So now they get colin kaepernick, probably one of the fastest, most talented quarterbacks in the league. But teams and people have underestimated this atlanta team all year long. They have gone out and they have done what it takes to win the game. 

[00:09:13]


>> Michael: I think atlanta at home doing whatever they need to do offensively. Tony gonzalez, congratulations, so happy for you. Tinues to get it done when they needit. On the other side, they had trouble covering zach miller today on the atlanta defense. What are they going to do with vernon davis and delanie walker. That's going to be a great matchvp to watch. 
>> Howie: All the things we talked about before the game apply to this next week. The mobile quarterback, the read option, the ability to extend play, physical runner, physical offensive line. Add to that equation more wpons, which san francisco has. It's a tough matchup. 
>> Terry: If I'm atlanta I'd look at that green bay tape and look at justin smith. I thought justin smith ped a whale of a game and aldon smith on the other side, those two guys and that great offensive LINE FOR THE 49ers, I TELL YOU, That's a tall order with that bunch right there. 
>> Curt: All that matters, the winner goes to the super bowl. We will see you next sunday, 2:00 eastern time, 11:00 a.M. Pacific with the pregame show. It's the nfc championship on fox next sunday. Can't wait for it. Here's today's chevy silverado player of the day. The nfc championship game is set and sure to be exciting. The atlanta falcons got there behind veteran tight end tony gonzalez. The future hall of famer won his first career playoff game as the falcons beat the seahawks. Tony gonzalez is your chevy silverado player of the day. business plane: The orderly way southwest does it and the wa all the other airlines do it.

>>> A bride and groom become wedding crashers when a hot-air hot-air balloon literally comes crashing down during their wedding. 
>> Brace, hold on. 
>> A camera is rolling as a wedding aboard a hot-air balloon goes horribly wrong. 
>> Yeah. 
>> Oh. 
>> The balloon would the entire wedding party on board crash landed in someone's yard and, get this, the groom didn't even want to go up in the first place because he's afraid of heights. 
>> It was magnificent and then we crashed. 
>> Yeah. 
>> Karen always dreamed of having a romantic sunset wedding in a balloon so she, her husband to be jonathan, the minister and 10 others squeezed into the basket with the balloon operator. 
>> I had some friends say why are you going up in the balloon? I said because she asked. 
>> At first it all went perfectly. 
>> Make me -- makes me happy. I'm going to love you always. 
>> But then a gust of wind caused disaster. 
>> We are heading towards powerlines and we just missed them. 
>> Yeah. 
>> We bounced a couple of times and then we slid and we were just being drug by the balloon. 
>> First thing I said was to the pilot, what am I going to tell the place I rented the tuxedo? 
>> Oh, yeah. 
>> One person suffered a back injury when the balloon crash landed in this back yard in san diego. 
>> Unbelievable we are all alive. 
>> Believe it or not, the couple went ahead with the reception, but their marriage gives a whole new meaning to the phrase "wedding crashers." 
>> Yeah. 
>>> Now a disturbing picture of justin bieber leads to an even more disturbing hoax. 

[00:16:46]


>> Have justin bi's fans taken their devotion to him to a scary new level. Every since -- ever since he was smoking a suspicious looking cigarette reported to be marijuana the term cut for bieber started tweeting on -- to stop smoking pot. Let's start a cut yourself for bieber campaign. It quickly became the top trend on twitter in the u.S. And it outraged whoopi goldberg. 
>> This cutting yourself, don't do that. 
>> But it turns out it was al a hoax. A closer look at the cuts show they are made of ketchup and the prankster who first created the phony twitter account posted a photo of a real missing child, claiming she was a girl who was cutting herself for bieber. Bieber's pal miley cyrus has come forward to say this hoax is not funny. Cutting is not something to joke about. There are people who are actually suffering from self- harm. This is so disrespectful. 
>> The group is also accused of targeting actor morgan freeman. 
>>> A lion on the loose, some folks were so scared they actually called 911, but of course you can't always believe your eyes. 
>> What would you do if you saw this running through your neighborhood? 911, where is your emergency? 
>> There's a lion that ran across the street, a baby lion. 
>> Oh, okay. 
>> The 9:00 operator quickly notified a cop on the street. 
>> There's a vicious animal according to the complainant that a lion is loose from the zoo. 
>> What was that last transmission? 
>> The officer can't believe what he's hearing as the calls keep coming in. 
>> I just saw a baby lion. 
>> What kind of animal? 
>> A baby lion. 
>> You think it's looking for food? 
>> I don't know. 
>> But that lion isn't the lion 
-- isn't a lion at all. It's a dog. His name is charles and he's definitely no king of the jungle. Charles is a labradoodle and his owner daniel painter has groomed him to look just like a lion. 

[00:18:48]


>> They panic because they think a lion got loose from the zoo and they get a lot of 9:00 calls about a lion at large. 
>> Charles is part of a growing trend called extreme grooming. Dogs groomed to look like other animals. Just look at this guy. He's made to look like a panda. The transformations are stunning. They shaved a shark on both sides of this dog. This one is turned into an octopus. The audience at this dog show seems to love it but others find it just plain freaky. After all the chaos he caused, charles is being treated like a celebrity in norfolk. 
>> Only on a silver platter for him. 
>> But sooner or later, everyone will realize this friendly pooch is just looking for a little attention. Even the police take it in stride. 
>> Downgrade that to a stray animal. It's a large poodle. 
>> That's a labradoodle, thank you very much. 
>> The dog charles even has a facebook page. Scribes him as a party animal.

>> This woman was humiliated when she found a valet ticket left inside her car with a written message describing her as fat. Actress sharon peoples says she was coming out of a place she had perform in at a regional theater in boca raton florida when she saw the description which the valet had written on her ticket so she could recognize her. 
>> It says play red dress and fat on it and I happen to be wearing a red dress. 
>> Making the situation all the more embarrassing, it was her boyfriend who actually saw the insulting note first. 
>> It made me very angry and hurt and embarrassed. I cried. I will admit it. It hurt my feelings. 
>> She complained and she says two full weeks passed before a manager from the valet company called and apologized but she says he didn't seem to take it very seriously. 
>> He apologized and at one point even said to me well you have to understand I'm dealing with 18 and 20-year-old kids. 
>> The valet company said in a statement we deeply regret this incident and the company has apologized to the customer and the employee has been disciplined.

>> Judge Brown: The little fairy godmother didn't come out of nowhere, wave a magic wand, and the costs get paid. 
>> It was a gift. 
>> Judge Brown: But you took advantage of it. 
>> I don't look a gift horse in the mouth. 
>> Announcer: All rise for judge joe brown. 
>> Judge Brown: Whoa! 
>> Announcer: Experience... Knowledge... And a passion for the truth... 
>> Judge Brown: I'm protecting womanhood and promoting manhood. 
>> Announcer: ...Bringing no-nonsense justice to americans everywhere. 
>> Judge Brown: If you listen, you may learn something. 
>> Announcer: It's time for judge joe. 
>> Jeanne: Some friends suffer badly when an ex-boyfriend takes liberties with a credit card. Make-up artist jennifer husted is suing her former friend for credit-card charges. Defendant katrina turner says she was unaware of the charges. Now it's "joe" time. 
>> Judge Brown: You're alleging that ms. Turner should be found liable to you for the use of a credit card and also for the necessity of renting a replacement motor vehicle. 
>> Correct. 
Judge Brown: How long have you known the defendant? 15 or so years. She went to high school with my brother. She's my sister-in-law's best friend. 
>> Was. 
>> Was. 
>> Judge Brown: Was. Okay. 
>> She called me up and told me that they were three days late in leaving for a vacation to disney world for her son's birthday -- who I adore, her son. 
>> Judge Brown: Son is 7. 
>> He is now. Yes. 
>> Correct. So, in the course of our conversation, we discussed it. She was trying to get a rental car and couldn't, and i suggested that she could rent my secondary vehicle, which is a '99 cadillac that I inherited several years ago. We both thought it was a great idea -- I needed the money, and she needed the car. So, we agreed that. We did not decide on an actual dollar amount at the time. While they were gone, I did wreck my primary car, and when i went to get a rental because i needed it until they returned from florida, the rental company charged me $250. 

[00:02:18]


>> Judge Brown: Now, why would she be liable to you for that? 
>> I called them up -- since we had not agreed on a dollar amount beforehand, I called them both up immediately and said, "hertz is charging me $250 for a rental, so that's what I will charge you." And they both agreed to that. 
>> Judge Brown: Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. That's a little after the fact. 
>> Okay. 
>> Judge Brown: You gave them a carte blanche, or blank check, up front with no instructions. And it's sort of like, "here, take the car. When you get back, I'll decide what you owe me." 
>> When I put forth the dollar amount, though, neither one of them had a problem with it. 
>> Judge Brown: After the fact? 
>> No, they were still in florida. This was during the fact. 
>> Judge Brown: Yeah. But they've got your '99 inherited cadillac. You see, when you start talking about the daily rental for the vehicle that you needed to replace the one that you wrecked, they could have gone down to hertz, budget, or whatever it may be and gotten the same deal and driven around in air-conditioned magnificence instead of a 12-year-old, high-level hooptie. 
[ Laughter ] 
>> my car is in great running order. And it was a rental fee that was only for two days, whereas they kept the car for a week. I don't see -- 
>> Judge Brown: Why don't you try putting it as, "look, I did you guys a favor. I'm kind of in a hard place. I need a favor, too"? 
>> Okay. 
>> Judge Brown: But that's not a contract. That's not gonna wash on that one. Now let's get to the credit card. It appears that her boyfriend's indicted at this point. And what seems to have happened is that after the credit card was returned to you, he kept the information. And he'd been doing a few online transactions after the plastic was returned to your custody and control. 
>> Correct. 
>> Judge Brown: How do you hook the defendant up to the credit card? 
>> Well, um, you are correct in that he is the one that asked -- 
>> Judge Brown: She and he used the credit card, you say? 

[00:04:18]


>> Correct. 
>> Judge Brown: All right, now, I think you've made out a basic case. Let's go to the defendant. Tell me about this. 
>> [ Clears throat ] okay, basically, for my son's 6th birthday, I wanted to take him to disney world. And I already had tickets and everything lined up, but my roommate decided that -- 
>> he's not your roommate. 
>> Judge Brown: Oh, whoa, whoa. Don't interrupt. Don't interrupt. She may be trying to be discreet. 
[ Laughter ] 
>> regardless. It doesn't really matter, regardless. However -- okay, so we wanted to go to disney world. My roommate,as we will call him, had told me that he, you know, was going to rent a car. Okay, so, that fell through. I called my friend, who has been my friend forever, and I was just talking to her about what was going on. I was obviously upset. We were, you know, a couple of days beyond going, you know, and so she offered me her vehicle at, you know, an undisclosed price. 
>> Judge Brown: Well, may I make a suggestion? 
>> Yes. 
>> Judge Brown: Your roommate's broke -- he can't get a credit card, and he can't rent the car, and he's bloody doggone desperate. Is he still your roommate? 
>> No. No. Absolutely not. 
>> Judge Brown: Now, he's under indictment. He may still be in jail unless he got bailed out. 
>> He's not in jail. 
>> Judge Brown: You bailed him out? 
>> No, sir. 
>> Judge Brown: Okay, good. 
>> Absolutely not. 
>> Judge Brown: Now, back to this point -- did you ask your friend for the credit card, or did he ask her for it? 
>> He asked her, and I have facebook messages between the two of them. I didn't know anything about it until we were 3/4 of the way to florida. 
>> Judge Brown: Well, that may be the case. Why did you take advantage of the situation and use it? E used the card. 
>> Judge Brown: No, you used it. Does your child go to a montessori -- 
>> yes, but it was a gift. Like, the whole premise of going to florida was -- 
>> it was never a gift. 
>> Judge Brown: No, excuse me. 
>> No, not from you. 
>> Judge Brown: Why is there a charge on that account paying for the montessori school expenses? 
>> I did not pay that. That was my roommate that did that. 

[00:06:22]


>> Judge Brown: Don't you get apprised of the expenses, the need to take care of certain things? In other words, your child needs this paid for? 
>> Yes, but that's also part of the criminal case -- 
>> Judge Brown: Now, if it gets paid for, as a responsible parent, I'm assuming you're not just gonna say magically it went away. 
>> No, sir. I work at his school. 
>> Judge Brown: Well, if you work at his school, then you know that it has to be paid for. How did you assume it got paid? 
>> No, I work for his school now to pay back the tuition that was -- 
>> Judge Brown: Because it was what? 
>> It was returned to her credit card, but I did not use her credit card. 
>> Judge Brown: Well, who put it up? 
>> I guess he did. 
>> Judge Brown: Well, that's the point. 
>> But all of this is part of the criminal case. This isn't part of -- 
>> Judge Brown: I understand, but the little fairy godmother didn't come out of nowhere, wave a magic wand, and the costs get paid. 
>> I don't look a gift horse in the mouth. 
>> Jeanne: We'll be right back with "judge joe brown." 
>> She knew as soon as I got my statement that he was using the credit card. I presented her with evidence upon evidence, and she lied for him and protected him. 
>> I did not lie for him. 
>> Absolutely, you lied for him. 
>> I did not lie for him. I believed that he would pay you. 
>> Jeanne: And later today... 
>> He told me, "okay, you have a leak. I'm coming over." I said, "okay." He came over the next day and put a pump in the back of the toilet. When he left, your honor, that's when the water started pouring out of the back of our toilet. We had no leaks, other than the sink. 
>> Judge Brown: Well, did you call him back? 
>> Yes, sir. 
>> Announcer: It's "joe" time after this. family best in taste, freshness, and nutrition? Easy. It's eb. Eggland's best. Better eggs. It's eb. 

[00:10:33]


>> Jeanne: We're back with "judge joe brown." The plaintiff in this case says she loaned a cadillac and a credit card to a friend for a family trip. She says both were returned, but mysteriously, the balance that card kept going up. Let's listen in. 
>> Judge Brown: In the criminal justice system, a great number of criminal charges are not theft of property, but receiving and/or concealing stolen property. 
>> Yes, but at no point did i know that he was using her credit card. 
>> Judge Brown: Well, how did you not know that this bat was due and owing on your child had not been taken care of? Didn't you make an inquiry? 
>> She knew as soon as I got my statement that he was using the credit card. I presented her with evidence upon evidence, and she lied for him and protected him. 
>> I did not lie for him. 
>> Absolutely, you lied for him. 
>> I did not lie for him. I believed that he would pay you. 
>> Absolutely, she lied for him. 
>> Judge Brown: Well, who did you assume paid this bill for your child? 
>> Uh, honestly, he said that his grandmother used the credit card, and he was paying her. 
>> That was a secondary charge, I found out about. 
>> Judge Brown: Wait a minute -- used a credit card to pay for your child? 
>> Yes, he was helping me out. 
>> Judge Brown: And i-i-i-i won't even get into conjecturing how is it that roommate gets the idea that he can approach friend about borrowing her credit card and to pay her back. 
>> That I do not know. 
>> I did it for her. 
>> Judge Brown: Complicity. But, now, let's resolve this. As I've already ruled, you don't have standing to proceed against her because you had an accident in one of your own vehicles. You had allowed somebody to use another vehicle. They were in the process of using that vehicle. You can't make a claim to them about that. And that after the fact thing of, "i gave you carte blanche on the front end. Now, halfway through it, I want to charge you something" -- that doesn't work. 
>> Okay. 
>> Judge Brown: The other thing is, is as you allege in your complaint, her boyfriend approached you. 
>> Correct. 
>> Judge Brown: And he asked to use thand his agreement with you was, do him this favor. He was gonna pay you back when he got his settlement check. 

[00:12:41]


>> When the check cleared his bank account, which would have been -- 
>> Judge Brown: Now, she's not in privity of contract or agreement with you, but if she got the use of the thing, that's the same as, "okay, you didn't steal the man's computer, but you received it." So I might order restitution as a criminal court judge to the person who was victimized by the theft of his computer that you wound up having. 
>> Exactly. 
>> Judge Brown: What was that? I-i-i need to refresh my recollection. What was that montessori charge? 1,059 and change. 
>> Judge Brown: What I am gonna give you is a partial award, and that will be $1,100 relative to the montessori because I'm holding that she knowingly took advantage of the credit card. And if she received a benefit on your account, then she's gonna be obligated to pay that back. 1,100 and your costs. 
>> Miss Sonia: This courtroom is now in recess. 
>> Jeanne: It took a credit card to discover the roommate had to go, and it took a judge to determine the defendant had to pay. She enjoyed benefits -- she shares liability. And now we're on to the next case. 
>> Miss Sonia: Please raise your right hand. 
>> Jeanne: Landlord kenneth paulson is suing his former tenants for rent and damages. Defendants cynthia and anthony forde say they didn't have time to clean. 
>> Judge Brown: Mr. Paulson, you're suing your former tenants mr. And mrs. Forde for $1,740. You say they moved out early without paying rent, and when you inspected the apartment, there was waste and a water leakage that you allege they should have reported to you. The failure of reporting resulting in an excessive water bill. 
>> Yes, your honor, joe brown. 
>> Judge Brown: Tell me why we're here today. 
>> When they first moved in with their previous roommate, the other roommate moved out, and they asked that their daughter be allowed to move in. And we modified the lease for that to happen. The daughter moved in. They were current on their rent up until the endf november, and then december, they'd asked for an extension until about the 10th. And after I contacted them on THE 13th, THEY SAID THEY WERE Not able to pay the rent, and ey were going to move out. They accomplished their move-out ON THE MORNING OF THE 20th, I Believe, and when I went to inspect, that's when I found the damages. The apartment had not been cleaned, the water was running in the toilet, and I made note of all those discrepancies. 

[00:15:25]


>> Judge Brown: So, you're suing for $880 for one month's rent, a 20-day late fee that would be $500, and then damages and cleaning fees -- $239, and you claim excess water usage of $121. 
>> Yes, judge brown. 
>> Judge Brown: How do you compute the increase? 
>> I got that from the water bill when it arrived. I also read the meter the day that they had moved out and compared it. 
>> Jeanne: We'll be back with more "judge joe brown" in a moment. 
>> The bathroom not been cleaned. There was very thick dust on... 
>> You rushed us out. 
>> ...The fan blades of the -- 
>> he gave us no time to do anything. 
>> Judge Brown: Wait a minute. Wait, wait, wait. What do you mean, he gave you no time? 
>> He rushed us out, sir. hold on. overweight life. I obsessed about my weight my whole life. I figured I was just born that way. I was always on some new, life-stopping diet. And then, weight watchers. It lets me be me. And I naturally became a healthier me. I amazed myself. Get used to it. Because when a weight loss program is built for human nature you can expectmazing. Introducing the new weight watchers 360 program. Join for free and expect amazing. Because it works. 

[00:17:46]


>> Jeanne: We're back with "judge joe brown." The plaintiff in this case ss his tenants ignored a running toilet, and the usage was sky high. He says the defendants moved owing for rent and a huge water bill. Let's listen in. 
>> Judge Brown: All right, let's go to the defendants. Which one of you wishes to speak, mr. And mrs. Forde? 
>> I do. [ Clears throat ] 
>> Judge Brown: Mrs. Forde. 
>> Your honor, um, ken, um, as it stated in the lease, the rent was -- I mean, excuse me -- the water was free. 
>> Judge Brown: Not free, but it's supposed to be included in the lease. 
>> Included in the lease. We didn't have a water bill. 
>> Judge Brown: Which brings us to the issue of the flowing toilet. 
>> Okay. 
>> Judge Brown: Now, you say you brought it to the landlord's attention? 
>> No, this is what happened -- mr. Paulson came to us earlier, before december, and wanted us to pay $170 for overage of water. And I didn't agree with him. So I had to go obtain a lawyer. He came to our house, and he tried to sit down at the table and explain to us why we owe the $170, and he could not explain. He took his paperwork home, and he said, "well, when I get it together, I'll come back and let you know." So, I went and called and obtained a lawyer. 
>> Judge Brown: Well, I can tell you what the basis would be in formal legal language. The rent is predicated upon the inclusion of the utilities. The usage of the utilities is supposed to be a reasonable usage, and the reasonable usage, if it becomes exaggerated, no longer becomes reasonable. And that would imply an equitable need to revise the terms of the contract to reflect the unreasonable usage. 
>> But what happened was, there was no leak additionally. He came over and caused the leak. 
>> He, your honor, he called me in december -- 
>> there was no leak at all, sir. 
>> He called me in december. He said, "cynthia, is there any leaks visible to you?" I said, "no, sir." He said, "well, what I want to do is come over and put a dye in the toilet, and call me later on that afternoon and let me know what color the dye is." And I did that. Okay, when I called him and told him the color that was in the water -- that the water was, he told me, "okay, you have a leak. I'm coming over." I said, "okay." He came over the next day and put a pump in the back of the toilet. When he left, your honor, that's when the water started pouring out of the back of our toilet. We hadleaks, other than the sink. 

[00:20:06]


>> Judge Brown: Well, did you call him back? 
>> Yes, sir. 
>> Uh, your honor, that's not correct. I did fix the toilet, as she said, in november, because it was leaking. The fill valve was not working correctly. 
>> There was nothing to fix. 
>> I replaced it, but what I saw in dember, after they left, was the fill valve was stuck in the down position for whatever reason. 
>> That's what you fixed. 
>> It had moved -- somehow it got jammed in there, and it was not rising as the water rose in the tank to shut the water flow off. 
>> Everything that mr. Paulson tried to fix, it didn't -- if it wasn't broke, he broke it. Now, the toilet, there was nothing wrong with it. 
>> Judge Brown: Let me ask you, why did you move out? 
>> Oh, right. Why'd we move out. Yeah, yeah. That's the other problem here. 
>> Judge Brown: You see, 'cause most of his claim is not just on the small amount of $121 for excess water usage. 
>> Yeah. 
>> Judge Brown: We've got $880 for the rent on the month and the $500 late fees on the month. >> Yeah. 
>> Judge Brown: Now, how d explain that? 
>> Yeah, well, the main thing with that, sir, was just a shortage of money at the time. 
>> Judge Brown: Well, there you go. 
>> Yes. Yes, sir. 
>> Judge Brown: It's not good being broke. 
>> We came to him and let mr. Paulson know. 
>> Judge Brown: I understand. But, see, he could just -- you signed the lease, and the lease was not up. 
>> Yes. 
>> Judge Brown: Now, address t issue of whether or not the place was dirty when you moved out. 
>> Okay, your honor, he wrote us a letter, I think on the 13th OR 14th, AND TOLD US THAT WE HAD To be out that friday. We told him there's no way we could have it be out -- we needed the weekend to get the furniture and everything out. So, we left that monday, which was the 19th of december. 
>> As far as the cleaning goes, there was no cleaning done. Mrs. Forde said she was going to do it. The bathroom had not been cleaned. There was very thick dust on... 
>> You rushed us out. 
>> ...The fan blades of the -- 
>> he gave us no time to do anything. 
>> Judge Brown: Wait a minute. Wait, wait, wait. What do you mean, he gave you no time? 

[00:22:09]


>> He rushed us out, sir. 
>> Judge Brown: Now, hold on. 
>> Sir, we were both -- 
>> Judge Brown: He's already given you 20 days without -- 19 days without paying the rent. 
>> Thehad from the 10th when we talked that they said they were gonna move until the 20th -- THEY HAD 10 DAYS TO Clean it, and it wasn't accomplished. 
>> How we could clean it when everything is inside the place? 
>> Jeanne: Judge joe brown makes his ruling after this. 

[00:26:46]


>> Judge Brown: Your...Lease, both of them, says that you are to return the apartment to the landlord in a clean condition, but you're giving me an excuse because you had a problem. 
>> Well, I can own up. 
>> Judge Brown: You didn't have the money. 
>> Yes, sir. 
>> Judge Brown:1,654. I reduced the $25 a day by one day. That's $475 instead of $500. There's $880 due on the rentals. There's $239 cleaning fees. There's a dispute that I think may have a little merit on each side relative to the water damage -- that's $60 instead of $121, or half. So, your recovery is $1,654. That will be your award, plus your costs. 
>> Yes, judge joe brown. 
>> Miss Sonia: This courtroom is now in recess. 
>> Jeanne: Well, for a case involving so much water, things got pretty messy, dirty -- a leaking toilet, a broken lease. Still, the plaintiff presented a clean case. He wins. We'll be right back. 
>> Jeanne: We're back. Loud and menacing -- the toilet and the landlord, according to the defendants. Still, the judge found the plaintiff's claims to be valid, and he did manage to fix this problem. The plaintiff wins. For information on future cases, or to contact this court, check out our website at judgejoebrown.com.

Couple.

>> Judge Brown: Don't tell me you are a victim. 
>> She knows how much I love my car. My car was totaled. 
>> Judge Brown: That's your problem!

>> Announcer: It's time for judge joe. 
>> Jeanne: A woman is furnished with an excuse she can't buy after getting her old boyfriend a new couch. Medical assistant melanie marshall is suing her ex-boyfriend for a furniture loan. Defendant charles simpson says he lost his car doing a favor for the plaintiff. Now it's "joe" time. 
>> Judge Brown: Ms. Marshall, you're suing your ex, mr. Simpson. 
>> Yes. 
>> Judge Brown: And you say that his credit was bad. 
>> Yes. 
>> Judge Brown: So he was going, "please, please, please, pleas please," and you wound up putting on your credit-worthiness a certain item of furniture. 
>> Yes. 
>> Judge Brown: And you also loaned him $500. Hmm. So you have not been repaid, and you're seeking recovery of $2,423-odd dollars. Now, mr. Simpson, you have an interesting defense. You say because you were doing something for the plaintiff, you were "hit by an 18-wheeler while parked." 
>> Yes, sir. 
>> Judge Brown: So you say because, had you not been attempting to do something for her a week or so before this acquisition of the furniture item, you wouldn't have lost your vehicle, so therefore, she should be responsible for your loss. You had her on mind or in mind when you were...In a position to suffer the loss as the result of being struck by an 18-wheeler while parked. 

[00:02:16]


>> Yes, sir. 
>> Judge Brown: [ Sighs ] sometimes it's fascinating being here. 
[ Laughter ] let's see. Ms. Marshall, what happens? 
>> Let me tell you. After the accident and everything, around december 6th or so, he did ask me to come with him, him and his daughter, to go pick up furniture from raymour & flanigan and on 125th street. I did go with him. He picked out the furniture he wanted, and they ran his credit, and it didn't get approved, so they ran my credit. He asked me if I could putt on my credit. 
>> Judge Brown: He asked you right there on the spot. See, this is a bad thing. When somebody wants you to make a quick decision on the spot, it can have all of these downstream consequences. It's always better to say, "no, no, no, no, no, no. Tell you what. Let's put this on hold, and we'll come back to this after I've had an opportunity to engage in due deliberation on the consequences of what you're asking me to do." 
>> You're right. 
>> Judge Brown: Let's see. You could have told him, "i'm only 26, I have no children, I'm trying to get established, find a good husband, and you might convince me, since I'm spending all this time with you, young man, that you're gonna be somebody that can be a helpmate rather than a burden. I have to think about this development -- that you don't have the credit to get this chair." 
>> You're absolutely right. 
>> Judge Brown: It's a chair, wasn't it? 
>> It was a sectional. I have a picture of it. 
>> Judge Brown: A couch, yes. 
>> I said no plenty of times, but I just gave in only because I -- 
>> Judge Brown: He also told you he had how much coming on a tax refund? 6,100, and I had got his taxes done with with same person that I get it done by, so that's the only reason why I said okay to it. 
>> Judge Brown: Well, you got a 10-year-old. There is no guarantee unless -- you were sure of a lot of things with him. You were sure that 6 grand is coming back, but it got intercepted through some of those provisions for nonpayment of child support, but of course he wouldn't be delinquent. 

[00:04:34]


>> He does pay his child support. 
>> Judge Brown: Well, that's good, but what happened to the $6,000 from the anticipated tax refund? 
>> He claimed he never got it, and I'm the one that takes care of all his paperwork, so I was listening to the automated system. He got his a week after I got mine. 
>> Judge Brown: Well, you also got a three-month-zero-interest loan for which you purchased the couch at $1,671. 
>> Yeah, he asked for that. 
>> Judge Brown: Yes, you did that. You didn't just put it on a credit account. You got a loan. But it didn't get paid off in three months, so we now have another one, the one payment that you might have put on that to help get it down. You seemed to have loaned that to him, too. What's that about? The $500 loan. 
>> That was actually during the process, right before tax time, actually. I knew I was gonna get everything back around tax time. 
>> Judge Brown: That's the item. 
>> That was before -- yeah. He was supposed to move into his apartment -- 
>> Judge Brown: You know, that looks familiar, and you've made out, in other words, a basic case. And right now we're going to the defendant, and I am fascinated to discover what this 18-wheeler episode has to do with this case. 
>> Jeanne: We'll be right back with "judge joe brown." 
>> Basically, melanie asked me to drive us to south carolina. She didn't want to fly because she is too cheap to fly, so -- 
>> Judge Brown: Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Whoa! Don't go there. Don't tell me you are a victim. 
>> Jeanne: And later today... 
>> It was one thing that he took the boat. But it's another thing that he took it at night. The lights weren't even hooked up to the boat, so no wonder he crashed the boat, 'cause he went out pretty much blind. When I woke him up, he said, "i was drunk. What do you want me to do?" 
>> Announcer: It's "joe" time after this. family best in taste, freshness, and nutrition? Easy. It's eb. Eggland's best. Better eggs. It's eb. 

[00:09:09]


>> Jeanne: We're back with "judge joe brown." The plaintiff says she took a loan out to get her ex-boyfriend a couch. She says he promised to pay with his tax refund and never did. Let's get back to the court. 
>> Judge Brown: Mr. Simpson, please tell me about how your 2007 dodge charger died on thanksgiving -- around thanksgiving of year last. 
>> All right, sir. Basically, melanie asked me to drive us to south carolina. 
>> Judge Brown: From new york? 
>> From new york. She didn't want to fly because she is too cheap to fly, so -- 
>> Judge Brown: Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Whoa! Don't go there. Don't tell me you are a victim. 
>> So, yeah. I'm a victim. I'm a victim. 
>> That's a lie. 
>> I'm gonna tell you how I'm a victim. 
>> Judge Brown: Look, look. There is a recession going on. Nowadays, we have this thing called entitlement. "It's not my problem. Somebody's supposed to take care of me." Now, how do you become a victim? 
>> Well, how I'm a victim is melanie also has a car. We could have took her car. She knows how much I love my car. 
>> Judge Brown: So what? You were driving it. Who was behind the wheel? 
>> Who was driving what? My car? 
>> Judge Brown: Yes. 
>> I was driving it, yes. 
>> Judge Brown: Well, then how did it become her fault that you were driving your girlfriend someplace? 
>> 'Cause I took some days off work because melanie didn't want to fly. 
>> He's lying. 
>> Judge Brown: So what? What else is new? So, how did that become her fault? 
>> It became her fault because i wouldn't have been in north carolina if I wouldn't have drove melanie in the first place. 
>> Judge Brown: It doesn't work like that. 
>> But my car was totaled. 
>> Judge Brown: That's your problem! 
>> That's myproblem. 
>> He wasn't onlytaking me. I was like the first stop. I was going to south carolina, and -- 

[00:11:10]


>> Judge Brown: I got that. Look, young lady. Young lady, what I do, as a policy, is protect womanhood and promote manhood. Get over it, because what you've got on the line from what you are genetically evolved to be and by disposition -- it used to be by cultural mandate -- is supposed to be willing to not only sacrifice your favorite possession, to wit your 2007 dodge charger, but your life. 
[ Applause ] 
>> all right. 
>> Judge Brown: And the saying on that is women and children are resources to be protected, AND WE qRE EXPENDABLES HERE TO Protect them and provide for them, and that's what we do. So that's not going to wash. So, to make the lesson, you have no defense. That's not acceptable. You're not a victim. Get over thinking like that. It's unmanly. You strike me as a man, a young man. Let's get on with countering what you see on tv and everything else that's not manly. So we will start with lesson one, which as with all good lessons in life, is expensive. You will pay this woman for what you owe her -- $2,423 and your court costs. 
>> Even though she gave it to me as a gift? 
>> Judge Brown: No! 
>> Even though she gave the furniture as a gift? 
>> Judge Brown: No! 
>> And my credit is good? 
>> Judge Brown: Hellno! 
>> Your credit is nowhere good. 
[ Applause ] 
>> Judge Brown:2,423 and your costs. 
>> Miss Sonia: This courtroom is now in recess. 
>> Jeanne: Promise to pay, will you? Well, the couch-potato mentality never flies with the judge. The defendant borrowed money from the plaintiff for the furniture purchase. He will pay her back. Now we're on to the next case. 
>> Miss Sonia: Please raise your right hands. 
>> Jeanne: Law student garrett guttenberg is suing his brother for damages to his boat. Defendant spencer guttenberg says he refuses to give in to his brother's threats. 

[00:13:15]


>> Judge Brown: . Guttenberg, you're suing your younger brother, mr. Guttenberg. 
>> Yes, sir. 
>> Judge Brown: You're alleging that your younger brother, mr. Spencer guttenberg, without your permission, one evening while drunk, took your whaler boat and wrecked it. It appears he ran over a marker buoy and almost sunk the device. You found it swamped the next morning, and when confronting the defendant, he gave you his defense, which, as he utters in his written defense, sworn defense, is he doesn't owe because the boat isn't his responsibility, and he refuses to pay or give in to your threats. 
>> Yes, sir. 
>> Judge Brown: He acknowledges he was operating the boat. He provides the details that it ran over the marker buoy while he and his friends were cruising, and he freely acknowledges his inebriated condition, but he's not responsible. So, anyway... That's an admission against interest. Let's see. "I don't owe my brother any money. I borrowed my brother's boat one night in june with my friends. On the way back to the dock, i crashed into a buoy in the bay and damaged the boat. He never told me I was responsible for having to pay for anything that happened to it. I brought it back to the dock at my brother's house, tied it up to the dock, and went to sleep." 
>> Sounds about right. 
>> Judge Brown: Why haven't you paid for it? We can jump straight there. 
>> Because I had awoke that morning to him pulling me out of bed, threatening to smash my guitars if everything wasn't paid for, so I'm not gonna respond to any sort of physical threat like that. 
>> Judge Brown: And he's talking about his guitars. How many does he have? 
>> About 14. 

[00:15:15]


>> Yeah. 
>> Judge Brown:14? Well, I suggest you better sell some of them so you can pay for this boat. You want to tell me your impression of your little brother here? 
>> I mean, I came home. It was a friday night, and him and his friends were hanging out in the backyard. I saw them down on the dock. I didn't really think anything of it. Went to sleep, intentions to wake up about 7:00 a.M. To go fishing, and the boat's filled with water, and there was a huge hole on the side, so I knew they were down on the dock. I went right up to his room. I said, "what happened?" He must have went to bed about an hour before I woke him up, because he wasn't getting up. 
>> Judge Brown: Are you a first or second year? 
>> I just finished my first. 
>> Judge Brown: Congratulations. 
>> Thank you. 
>> Judge Brown: Now a lawyer, now you've been scared to death, year one, worked to death, year two, year three, you're bored to death, then you got to take the bar, and then the real work comes when you get sworn in. 
>> Jeanne: We'll be back with more "judge joe brown" in a moment. 
>> So I told him, "if you don't pay me, I'm gonna smash a guitar every day until you pay me." So he locked them in his room. He was refusing to pay. Finally he told me he would pay. 
>> Judge Brown: He locked himself in the room? 
>> The guitars. Uitars. 
>> Annou overweight life. I obsessed about my weight my whole life. I figured I was just born that way. I was always on some new, life-stopping diet. And then, weight watchers. It lets me be me. And I naturally became a healthier me. I amazed myself. Get used to it. Because when a weight loss program is built for human nature you can expect amazing. Introducing the new weight watchers 360 program. Join for free and expect amazing. Because it works. 

[00:18:19]


>> Jeanne: We are back with "judge joe brown." The plaintiff says he went to take out his boat and discovered it w badly damaged. He says he spoke to his brother, who told him he got drunk, took it out, and crashed it. Let's get back to the judge. 
>> Judge Brown: Where do you get off of that? 
>> What do you mean? 
>> Judge Brown: Your position is so patently absurd. 
>> And, your honor, you know, it was one thing that he took the boat. But it's another thing that he took it at night. The lights weren't even hooked up to the boat, so no wonder he crashed the boat, 'cause he went out pretty much blind. And, you know, when I woke him up, he said, "i was drunk. What do you want me to do?" So I told him, "if you don't pay me, I'm gonna smash a guitar every day until you pay me." So he locked them in his room. He was refusing to pay. Finally he told me he would pay. 
>> Judge Brown: He locked himself in the room? 
>> The guitars. Locked them all up. 
>> Judge Brown: "Well, I got to play my music, man. Like, man, can't you understand? Like, man, I'm inspired, man. You're interrupting my art, man." 
>> Basically. 
>> Judge Brown: Where do you get off of this? You wrecked $5,000 worth of his property that he's acquired at 23. He's working. He's one-third the way through getting his doctorate in law. He will be an attorney. It's a good, well-presented case in the way you wrote it up. Good for you. You got the skills. So, you clown, you're sitting up here doing nothing but wasting your time and life. You're working as a warehouseman, talking about you're a musician, and by now, if you had talent, you ought to have already been there. 
>> I'm recording a full-length album that's gonna release this summer. 
>> Judge Brown: Whoo. Ho. Nice. No what do you doing besides acting a damn fool? You could've killed yourself. 
>> I'm... 
>> Judge Brown: Apparently none of you even had on any life jackets. You ran over the buoy. 
>> We had them on the boat. 
>> Judge Brown: Uh-huh. How many of you were on this boat? 

[00:20:21]


>> Three of us. 
>> Judge Brown: How much had you been drinking? 
>> I hadn't been drinking. My friends had. 
>> Judge Brown: Well, why did you tell your brother that you were drunk? 
>> 'Cause I thought that if he thought I made a bad decision rather than being straight-up bad at driving the boat, then I'd be able to do it again. 
>> Judge Brown: Bad at driving the boat? Okay, you can't operate a boat. You don't need to be the captain. 
[ Laughter ] you aren't good at navigation. How do you run over a lighted buoy? 
>> It just took a wake and pushed us that way. I sort of landed on -- 
>> Judge Brown: A wake? 
>> Yeah. 
>> Judge Brown: It's not, "are you a fool?" But how big a fool do you cose to position yourself as. 
>> Your honor, if I may, I'd just like to bring out one point. Not only did he destroy my boat, but this is my only time off, my summer. 
>> Judge Brown: Summer, and you're living in erie, where there's a lot of ice around there, so this is a time to enjoy it. And I know what you went through your first year in law school. That is one of the worst things you can possibly go through. Nobody tells you what's gonna be going on. You don't have any quizzes. It's one midterm and one final, and nobody's giving you a clue, and that's what you sink or swim on, and everybody's desperate because the question is, "what's this all about?" 
>> Jeanne: Judge joe brown makes his ruling after this. 

[00:26:05]


>> Judge Brown: And over here, you're out drunk, playing the guitar, working in a warehouse, which you aren't working regularly, and you're talking about 14 guitars, locking yourself in a room, and, "he was mean to me, and I'm not paying it. Why should I have to pay 'cause I wrecked it?" Well, guess what. It is a bailment. You took into your custody and had under your control the personal property of another. Whether or not he gave you permission to use it, whether you took it, purloined it, filched it, or you got permission to use it, you have an obligation to return that personal property to the true owner in the same coition you received it, absent ordinary wear and tear. A hole in the bottom and the boat half-sunk and flooded at the dock is not ordinary wear and tear. Therefore, you're responsible. Same thing. He's got an obligation to return it, and you over here, banish some of your ignorance. Start being enterprising like your three-year-older brother. He's 23, and you're gonna make him whole. And I'm looking at this. The value of the boat is almost $5,000 -- well, $4,063. I'll give you $4,500 to make sure you get it restored, so that will be your award and your costs. Now, you need to grow up and man up a bit. 
>> Thank you, your honor. 
>> Miss Sonia: This courtroom is now in recess. 
[ Applause ] 
>> Jeanne: Well, the judge rocked the defendant's boat -- this time, found him liable from the get-go, found time to give advice to the law-student plaintiff. He also gave him the judgment. We'll be right back. 
>> Jeanne: We are back. This case capsized for the defendant when he entered the boat and then judge joe's court. Pphe drove the boat to its demise, ppAND BY THE RULES OF BAILMENT, HE Will pay. To submit your case to "judge joe brown," to download sale documents, or to find out how the law can work for you, go TO judgejoebrown.com.

Which isn't rt science. It's just common sense. From td ameritrade. 
>> Judge Jeanine: I have never seen anything like it. The irony couldn't be richer. The hypocrisy more outrageous. The message couldn't be more meaningful. Welcome to "justice." I'm judge jeanine pirro. The journal news continues to hide, refusing to explain why they printed the names and addresses of legal gun owners including yours truly. Instead they are in a hole hunkered down hoping it will pass and that we will all just go away. And get this. They hired armed body guards who won't give us their names or a map to their homes. Thick a look. 
>> -- Take a look. 
>> We are here at the journal news building hoping someone will talk to us. 
>> Why won't you talk to us? 
>> Because it is difficult, you know. 
>> Wld you tell me why you guys released the names of the gun other thans. 
>> I'm sorry. I'm on the phone. 
>> Can you you speak to us for a second? Can we he come in with you and speak with you? Why are you hiding from us? 
>> I'm not hiding at all. 
>> Why won't you answer the questions. 
>> I'm a security guard here. Can I have a card and we'll have somebody call you. 
>> You are a security guard here, though. Why would you be wantin to work here. Wasn't your name put out on the list of people as well. 
>> I have no comment. I just am asking for a card so they can contact you. 
>> We want you off the property. 
>> Can I ask who you are? 
>> I represent -- we are here at the home of the publisher of the journal news to see if she will talk to us. 
>> H hi, janet. 
>> As you can see, we had the door slammed right in our face. We are at the home of cindy royal the editor of the journal news and as you can see behind me he there seems to be a guard in her driveway. 

[00:02:10]


>> Are you protecting this home? 
>> I have no comment. 
>> Are you a registered gun owner. 
>> I have no comment. 
>> Were you on the list? That they released? 
>> Judge Jeanine: Thanks to our producer there. Anyway, this week I have been thinking about the reason publisher janet hasson and the journal news gang who managed to ignite a national firestorm gave as a reason for the creation of the interactive map of permit gun holders in westchester. We felt sharing as much information as we could about gun ownership in the area was important in the aftermath of the newtown shooting. Let's parse that one out. In the aftermath of the shooting of innocent children you the journal news think it is important to what? To out us? Think about it. You think it is important to out us in the afterthe math of the newtown shooting? How dare you connect law' abiding citizens who have gone through background checks and fingerprinted and received judicial approval to exercise their second amendment rights. How dare you compare them to a nut shop on a lunatic fringe in desperate need -- how dare you compare them to battered women in hiding to the families of police officers and judges and d.A.S like me. This animal massacred innocent babies. He didn't have a pistol permit or go through a rigorous background check. He took someone else's gun. And by the way, although it is none of your business, there is a reason people have guns. We don't need your sanctimonious position. You put your families in danger and pry you into our lives and put our privacy and security and our safety in jeopardy and then you have nothing to say? Let's follow your reasoning. If certain records are public, should we also publish the names of people he receiving food stamps, getting unemployment? Those on welfare? The mentally ill? Should we give people maps to their homes? There might be a good reason, after all. Maybe people on unemployment are working off the books. Why don't you out the nearly 40,000 criminals the d.A., My office and I prosecuted every year? The thieves, the rapists, the drug dealers, those who possessed illegal guns and used them in homicides. And by the way, in my 30 years in law enforcement I can remember only one legally registered handgun used in a murder. These are the people who have already shown that our laws of meaningless to them. And how about a pedophile? Let's map the way to their homes. A child is certainly in more danger of a pedophile in the neighborhood than a legally registered handgun. Why don't you just admit it was an immensely bad idea that you exercised poor judgment or no judgment at all. That it waa cheap anti-gun stunt that, by the way, is turning out to be pretty expensive for you, you champions of free speech. You are losing subscriptions, advertisers, hiring body guards for your home and the workplace. There is a call for a national boycott of your news paper. How are you going to explain that one to your board of directors in may? Instead you have the audacity to hide. You have nothing to say about your indefensible position. You have no comments. How about I say it for you? You are nothing but a bunch of cowards unwilling to defend yourselves, frozen in fear, you screwed up. Period. End of story. With me is gary rose, chairman of the department of government and politics at sacred heart university. And elizabeth stone professor of media studies at fordham university. We know that new york is one of those states where the name and address of someone who owns a gun is public information. But I will ask each of you, has the privacy of gun owners been violated? 

[00:06:39]


>> Well, that was my principle concern when I first heard about what was happening here in new york and there is also a proposal in connecticut to do the same thing. Not necessarily publish an interactive map but nevertheless publish the names of all gun owners. There is a lawmaker introduceing that during the spring legislative session. 
>> Judge Jeanine: There are 29 states that prohibit the release of this information. And professor stone do you think this is the kind of information that puts legal gun owners in jeopardy? 
>> I think this is a conversation that needs to be had with the state legislature. But I also think that this is a wonderful conversation right here that the rockland journal news prompted. 
>> Judge Jeanine: The journal news prompted it but at the same time there are county clerks in putnam county specifically who said under the public officer's law we believe in is an invasion of privacy and we feel this is something that has to be remedied. Are there standards for journalists the way there are for doctors and lawyers? Are there -- is there a code of ethics for journalists? 
>> There has to be anded there is. 
>> Is there? 
>> Absolutely. 
>> I think this is an event. There was a mass shooting 15 miles from the border. 
>> Judge Jeanine: My question is are there standards? 
>> Yes, there are. 
>> Judge Jeanine: Like the code of ethics. 
>> Standards of news worthiness. This was a legitimate story. You might argue and I would share some of your concerns with how they dealt with it. But the conversation about the density of gun ownership is a legitimate conversation to have. 
>> Judge Jeanine: But that can be accomplished by simply putting the pinpoints in the map of people who have guns without identifying them. 
>> I agree with you. 
>> Judge Jeanine: You do? 
>> Yes, on that. 
>> I have serious issues with what s going on in new york and also now connecticut and in states where they want to publicize the names. When I first heard about this my thoughts went right back to a ruling interestingly enough that came out of the state of connecticut in 1965 the griswold case in which a liberal justice appointed by roosevelt said that the bill of rights contains what we call a constitutional right to privacy. It is not just in the 9th amendment. It winds its way through the entire bill of rights and gun ownership I would argue is in fact a privacy right. 

[00:08:59]


>> Judge Jeanine: There are courts that held that it is, and it is truly he an invasion of privacy. And the 29 states that won't allow the publication of this information agreed. Don't you think that newsworthiness depends upon the information that the newspaper wants to make. 
>> If I live next door are to a person that has a gun and my kid has play dates with that person I would like to know if there is a gun there. 
>> Judge Jeanine: Why don't you just ask them? They live right next door to you. 
>> Maybe I will. 
>> Judge Jeanine: Let's get some talk that my producer pulled out. 
>> It is interesting. Creates a discussion of who around us has gun. Might not have been what i would have chose ton do but i don't think that the journalists should be intimidated for releasing the information. 
>> With all due respect to the -- I believe he is a priest, he doesn't think that the journalist should be intimidated. What about the people whoe guns that feel intimidated? What about the people who don't have guns and now a criminal has a blueprint to their house because they don't have guns? 
>> What I find troubling about this s the fact that this -- the journalists feel so frightened that they need to hide. If it weren't a matter of gun ownership, if they had outed people about other events they wouldn't be hiding. They wouldn't be fearing. They. 
>> Judge Jeanine: What are they fearing? 
>> People with guns. 
>> Judge Jeanine: People with guns? You believe they are afraid of people with guns? How come no one has been arrested. 
>> Do you think if they outed people who chew a lot of guns -- 
>> Judge Jeanine: I can feel threatened, too. Do you think there is a difference between the outing of someone with guns and the outing of someone who receives an abortion that is paid for are with taxpayer dollars? 
>> I would argue that there is a fundamental difference in that. 

[00:11:04]


>> Judge Jeanine: Which one should be outed? 
>> Yes, you know, when we get into the abortion issue then i would argue that -- 
>> Judge Jeanine: It is a health issue. 
>> Yes, very much so. 
>> Judge Jeanine: Thanks for being with us this evening. I appreciate it. 
>> And now we want to know what you think. Has the journal news put legal gun owners in danger by printing their names and mapping out their addresses. Go to my facebook page or twitter account at judge jeanine and tell me the results and a few of your comments, keep it clean guys. At the end of the show. 
>> Coming up, a mother's worst nightmare. Home alone with young children and an intruder breaks in. How one woman protected her family and we can hear it all on tape. Georgia man melinda herman is home with her nine-year-old twins. Breaks into her house. Take a listen to her husband who is on the phone both with melinda and 911 in the bedroom? Relax. Just remember, everything that I showed you. Everything that I taught you, all right. She shot him. She is shooting him. She is shooting him. 

[00:15:01]


>> Judge Jeanine: The intruder, shot five times ran out of the home but was arrested. Melinda and her children safe. Withnow is larry pratt who is the executive director of gun owners of america from d.C. And otis mcdonald, the inspiration for the book "an act of bravery." He became the public face of gun rights when challenged chicago's handgun ban. Thanks for being with us. Otis, you live in the city of chicago. One of the most violent cities in the country. You wanted a handgun and were are that you couldn't have one. You took your case to the united states supreme court. Why? 
>> Because I was afraid for my family. All of a sudden I look around and I can't protect them. And I thought that this is not right. I knew that I had to try and do something. My garagd been broken into twice. My house had been burglarized five different times. My life had been thed and I said that this is enou, i have got to find some way. I go to a cap meeting every month for the last 25-30 years. And I know that the policemen are doing the best that they could and I had to go and -- 
>> Judge Jeanine: Otis, you take the case to the united states supreme court. That is not easy to do. Larry pratt, let me ask you. The idea of someone having to go all the way to the united states supreme court to just get confirmation of what they already know, their second amendment rights. Isn't that a little frustrating for gun owners? 
>> Frustrating is a very mild word. It is so outrageous that politicians who are well protected by men with guns throughout our country and in particular in washington and in fact the law that mr. Mcdonald was suffering under was pushed through by then mayor jane byrne who said why would anybody need a gun and at the very time she was surrounded, surrounded by armed chicago police officers. 

[00:17:20]


>> Judge Jeanine: And otis, when you hear about that 911 call where a woman is with her twins, a mother just learning how to use a gun, if she were in the city of chicago she wouldn't be able to have that handgun, would she? 
>> No, she wouldn't. At that time, anyway. But -- and that is -- sorry. 
>> Judge Jeanine: Go ahead. 
>> And that is mind boggling. I don't understand it. Why would innocent law abiding citizens be denied a right to protect themselves in their homes and families when all the gun criminals are running out here with all these guns and the police cannot possibly take all of them. I mean they do the best that they can. 
>> Judge Jeanine: Right, right. And clearly in that situation of the woman that we just heard on the 911 melinda herman, the police could not possibly have gotten there in time. But when you hear that the journal news that newspaper that released the names of permit owners in westchester and rockland did an interactive map literally mapping the way to their homes, what do you think of that, otis? Do you tnk that was the right thing for the journal news to do? 
>> Of course, not. That is saying to me that all of the years that you have worked and paid taxes in your home, I have been living there since 1971, and you don't have no right and we care more about the criminals than we do you. And I'm still paying taxes. 
>> Larry, let me ask you, where do you think this whole discussion is going in the country regarding gun owners? What do you think ultimately is going to happen given that the united states supreme court said the individual has a right to have a weapon? 
>> I think we have got to smoke out what seems to be behind us. Too many times people advocating gun control seem to be very happy with an elitist assumption they are worth protecting and the rest of us chopped liver. I think maybe after the tragedy in newtown people are beginning to realize we have been trying gun-free zones now for 20 years and all we get for the trouble is massacres in gun-free zones. Isn't it about time that we wake up and tell the politicians either get with the program or we will get a new politician it and change these laws that militate against decent people being able to defend themselves even though the politicians can't do anything to keep cri from getting guns to hurt the rest of us. 

[00:20:08]


>> Larry pratt and otis mcdonald who joins us interest chicago the gun-free city that is one of the most violent in the country. I appreciate you bing with us this evening. 
>> Thank you, judge. 
>> Thank you, judge. 
>> Judge Jeanine: Weigh in on our instapoll has the journal news put legal gun owners in danger. Go to coming up, one of the prosecution star are witnesses. Accused killer of jodi arias spent supposed quality time with right after the murder of the victim in this case. Ryan burns is next. 
>>> Two football players accused of raping a 16-year-old girl. The attorney for one of the players is here in a "justic]" exclusive. Stay with us. 

[00:24:19]


>>> All of the evidence against me right now is very compelling. 
>> What really happened in there? 
>> In a nut shell, two people took travis' life, two monsters. 
>> You did not shoot travis? Never have even shot a real gun. 
>> You did not stab him 27 times? 
>> That is heinous. 
>> Or slit his throat from ear to ear. 
>> I can't imagine slitting any one's throat. No jury is going to convict me? 
>> Why not? 
>> Because I'm innocent. No jury will convict me. 
>> Judge Jeanine: Will the prediction hold true? Will a jury set free a woman accused of shooting, stabbing and slitting the throat of travis alexander. With m s a man who had a relationship with jodi and was I and was with her the day after the murder. Good evening, gentlemen. 
>> Good evening. 
>> Good evening. 
>> Judge Jeanine: Ryan, you met jodi a couple of months before travis was murdered. 
>> Yes. 
>> Judge Jeanine: And you had some kind of a relationship with her. What was the extent of relationship? 
>> I met her at that national convention with our company. She was from california. I was from utah and met her in oklahoma and got her number. Me and her started talking on the phone and we kind of started developing a relationship and she was going to come out and visit me in utah and that is when the whole travis alexander thing went down on that trip when she was supposed to come meet me. 
>> Judge Jeanine: You were supposed to meet her on a particular day but she showed up the next day? 
>> That's right. 
>> Judge Jeanine: Can you piece it together? 
>> As the evidence started coming out a few weeks after he was killed she was supposed to come and see me. She was leaving l.A. Tuesday night and supposed to take her 12 hours to get to my house. I called her after 12 hours and her phone was off for 24 hours and 36 hours later she shows up to the house and the entire time she was missing her phone was off. 

[00:26:24]


>> Judge Jeanine: In the two months you had communicated with her had you known h her phone to have been off for a long time? 
>> If I sent her a text or called her she was back within 60 seconds every time so it was very unusual. 
>> Aaron who joins us from arizona. You were friends with jodi as swell. It turns out that -- as well. It turns out that you had driven jodi to the police station on the day that she went in to talk to the police. Can you tell us what it was like in the car are with her? 
>> Nothing out of the ordinary happened that evening. You know, she had asked me to help her out with a ride because she was here in arizona with transportation. The conversation in the car talked about mainly how sad she was that travis was gone and how horrible it was that somebody would do something so brutal to this person that she supposedly loved. And now we know the truth of what her real involvement is. 
>> Judge Jeanine: Aaron, now now apparently travis' friends did not like her. 
>> They did not have is a very high opinion of jodi. 
>> What was their opinion of her? 
>> At first we all thought she was a good match for travis. There were issues in the relationship. A true side of her came out and a lot of -- 
>> Judge Jeanine: What was that side, aaron? What did you see that you guys didn't like? 
>> There were issues with jealouscy vindivtiveness. Things that made her out to be somebody that was jealous and had issues going on in her that she wasn't able to resolve. 
>> Judge Jeanine: You saw her the day after as they piece it together the murder of travis alexander. What was her physical condition? 

[00:28:27]


>> Nothing unusual about it. There were two small bandages on her fingers. People said her hand was all bandaged up. There were two small cuts. She said she cut her fingers at the place where she used to work, margaritaville on a glass that she broke. 
>> Judge Jeanine: What was she like in court are? What was her behavior are and how was she acting? 
>> Straight face. Didn't have much of anything. 
>> Judge Jeanine: Did she react to you at all? 
>> Not really. Not really. 
>> Judge Jeanine: Aaron o, travis' friends now, are any of them communicating with jodi? 
>> Not that I'm aware of. Pretty much everyo has cut off all communication with her. As you can see in the courtroom the people there witnessing this case are travis' friends. She has her mother and an aunt and I believe one other friend on her side. Nobody is backing jodi on this one. 
>> Judge Jeanine: Thanks for being with us this evening. And coming up, our "justice" expert panel on this week's developments in that jodi arias trial. And later, I go one on one with the attorney for one of the football players accused in the steubenville rape case. Patriots. Let's get you back to "justice" with judge jeanine. ?????? I'm going home going to load my shotgun, going to wait by the door and light a cigarette, he wants a fight well now he has got one, he ain't seen me crazy yet ???????????? 

[00:33:25]


>> Judge Jeanine: This weekend testimony focused on the timeline of the injuries the victim sustained. 
>> I felt that the gunshot wound may have been last but in any event the gunshot wounds and the wounds to the neck would have had to have come after the defensive wounds of the hands. 
>> You were asked about in terms of sequencing which came first. Which wound came first, correct? 
>> Yes. 
>> Okay. And do you recall what your answer was? 
>> I answered that the gunshot was possibly first. 
>> Do you recall relaying the opinion that mr. Alexander would be conscious after being -- suffering the shot to the head. 
>> That was my opinion at that time. 
>> That was your opinion. But what you were -- so you weren't relaying dr. Arndt's opinion as you said during the transcripts. You were relaying your own? 
>> That was my understanding of what the situation was. I'm not the ultimate decisionmaker on that. 
>> Judge Jeanine: With me is criminal detention attorney and former prosecutor jeff gold and psychologist dr. Jeffrey gardier and former nypd detective harry halp. We saw a detective covering an opinion that the gunshot wound came first which kind of made a little sense because then he be incapacitated. Have you been asked to formulate an opinion regarding which injuries came first as a detective? 
>> You know, it is very hard to do and I usually do that on the crime scene. I would look around and try and piece the crime scene together, all right. As this detective probably did also based on the evidence that was at the crime scene what might have happened first. Personally, I think the gunshot occurred first myself. 
>> Judge Jeanine: So do i. If I'm the prosecutor in the case you know what I'm doing. I'm saying objection, he is a detective, he s not a medical expert. You know, and get that off the table. I will move down the table this way. 

[00:35:29]


>> He is a medical examiner, not here today. 
>> Talk about your field of expertise. This woman is a whack job, yes? 
>> At some point you will be discussing this why not an insanity plea. She s a whack job and crazy but it doesn't rise to the level of legal insanity. 
>> Judge Jeanine: Doctor, in terms of your background this woman hooks up with another are guy shortly after she allegedly stabs, shoots and slits the throat of her are boyfriend. 
>> Right. 
>> I mean can you identify these people in public? What do they look like other than a black widow? 
>> These are people who are are sociopaths. 
>> We are looking at a bloody scene photo of the home. 
>> How do you go through something like this and then hook up with someone right afterwards, you are smiling, you are dancing, you are singing while you are in prison. All of that is part of that sociopathic personality, antisocial personality. She is not the a schizophrenic but you she is very seriously disturbed. 
>> Judge Jeanine: But she doesn't appear to be disturbed. Insanity defense, jeff, would you offer it? 
>> It ought to be. But she is too crazy to use it. She says first I didn't do it and then it was intruders and then domestic violence. She tells the court she wants to represent herself. She is whacky but only whacky to get the defense that could help her. 
>> We don't know it. 
>> We don't know it because she hasn't allowed herself to be he examined. 
>> We know it. Look at all of the interviews that she has given. Obviously she is very disturbed but very manipulative. She s a liar are and we see it but it is not -- 
>> hair relationship, go ahead. Go ahead. 
>> Doesn't the premeditation show that she is not insane? 
>> The fact that she had the premeditation quite often you don't see them being able to get an insanity plea. 
>> Judge Jeanine: The premeditation and blaming it on someone else tells me she knows the difference between right and wrong and that is why she is saying two guys came in and I got away. She is a calculating wid. 

[00:37:42]


>> That may be the case but you that is the only thing that would save her is a possible insanity defense. 
>> Judge Jeanine: Will she get the death penalty? 
>> I think so. 
>> What do you think? 
>> I think she won't get it. 
>> Judge Jeanine: Harry? 
>> I hope so. 
>> Judge Jeanine: We will talk to you a little later in the show. Up next for the first time, the attorney for one of the football players accused in the steubenville rape case that divided the midwest town in ohio and created controversy across the nation talks.

[00:40:53]


>> Judge Jeanine: In steubenville, ohio, a night of partying for a group of high schoolers goes horribly wrong. Now, two young men face rape charges. A 16-year-old girl will never be the same. And a town torn apart. 
>> To be labeled as a rape city, the city that cover is up things is just to me appalling. 
>> National outrage over an alleged rape of an underaged girl in this small ohio town. Photos, videos and tweets about the incident posted online. Now, two 16-year-old high school football players trent mays and malik richmond are charged with the rape of a 16-year-old girl who lived just across the river from steubenville. August 11, mays and richmond along with the 16-year-old girl go party hopping. According to witnesses she is so drunk she can't walk. This disturbing photo appears to show the limp body of an unconscious girl being carried by her kist and ankles. Hacker group calling itself anonymous posted this photo along with this explosive video where even a graduate of the high school joked about the incident. What if that wasour daughter? 
>> I couldn't care. I would let her be dead. 
>> Many accused the school and the football crazed town of a coverup. They say the big red players get special treatment. School superintendent michael McVAY DISAGREES. 
>> Football is part of our system but they are no better than the other programs. 
>> Steubenvillpolice arrested the two teens ten days after the alleged rape. Residents now hope justice will be served. 
>> That courthouse right there. Whatever is going to happen, let it happen in there, not out here. 

[00:42:58]


>> Judge Jeanine: Now, on a "justice" exclusive, brian duncan the attorney for trent mays one of the accused steubenville defendants. Thanks for being with us. It is very unusual for a defense attorney in a case like this to want to talk about it nationally. You say you want to clear stuff up. What do you want to clear up? 
>> First let me thank you for the opportunity to be here this evening. We appreciate it. One thing that we wanted to talk about clearly was the negative publicity that has been set out on the entire are steubenville, ohio community as well as the surrounding area. And really show and state that there are very wholesome individuals that comprise that community. 
>> Judge Jeanine: Your client is accused of one of the most vicious crimes imaginle. A young girl who was party hopping who was apparently drunk if not drugged and almost unconscious according to the videos we are seeing. What will the defense be in a case like that? 
>> With respect to the video itself, the video is repulsive, clearly. We believe it has no evidenary value with respect to the case. 
>> Judge Jeanine: Isn't your client in the video? 
>> No, your honor. He is not in the video nor is the other named defendant. Neither of the individuals appear in the video nor were they present at the time that the video was in fact shot. 
>> Judge Jeanine: It appears there are not codefendants but in students from the school who are testifying against your client and the other defendant. Are they making this up? There is a basis upon which to believe something horrific happened to this girl. 
>> Well, the basis was set forth in the original probable cause hearing that took place in or about the middle of september. At that hearing one of the underlying charges which was kidnap was in fact thrown out. 
>> Judge Jeanine: But the rape wasn't? 

[00:45:00]


>> The rape charges are still proceeding forward in court. 
>> Judge Jeanine: How are you going to defend your client? Look, this is an unusual situation because the victim in this case was supposedly unconscious. Is that y understanding that she cannot identify who did this? 
>> Our understanding is that the time the witness who is testifying that there was some activity on behalf of our client at that time the jane doe was in fact conscious and she -- 
>> Judge Jeanine: And that she did engage in sexual intercourse. Is your defense that there was sexual intercourse, but it was consentual? 
>> No, we are not stating that there was in fact sexual conduct. Sexual conduct is the standard in ohio which would determine whether or not there was a rape and that will require -- 
>> Judge Jeanine: What about digital penetration. 
>> That is grounds for sexual conduct which could be grounds for rape. 
>> Judge Jeanine: Your client was at the party, correct? 
>> Our client was present? 
>> Was he one the ones holding her? 
>> We are not in a position to admit or deny that position. 
>> Judge Jeanine: He clearly there was. Has she testified in any way, shape or form yet? 
>> No. 
>> Judge Jeanine: Why are they in juvenile court? 
>> There was a proceeding and the judge determined this case should in fact be held in the juvenile system. 
>> Judge Jeanine: And the defendants stay in jail until they are are 21 if they are convicted or in the juvenile justice system. Joining me is megan o'brien. She joins us from cleave land. Megan, the 16-year-old girl at center of the case is unlike so many rape victims in trials that I have tried as a prosecutor are and as a judge. She has been videotaped. Her privacy is exposed more than your typical rape victim. Does this help or h hurt her? 
>> Well, first of all, what this victim has endured is extremely extremely traumatic. So the fact that she has to be revictimmized by these images being posted in a very small and closed community is extremely extremely hurtful and will continue to revictimize her for the rest of her life. 

[00:47:19]


>> Judge Jeanine: No question about it. What about the claim that the town is -- it was a very small town, maybe 18,000 people, every friday night during football season they pack the stands 10,000 strong for the football games. That the idea of these football players, these jocks, these testosterone driven guys being the heros is more important than the victimization of an innocent young girl? 
>> I will say that there are a lot of parallels to many cases we see at the cleveland rape crisis center in terms of in a closed community when you have any type of organization or system that holds power in the community it is going to be supported and backed so I think that we see this in a lot of cases when it is a community that is very small and closed. 
>> Judge Jeanine: What is interesting about this community is that it took the community or the outside community to outraged before there was action taken. Have you seen that kind of behavior before? 
>> I think we are seeing that more and more. I think it is absolutely terrible that this individual victim, the survivor's life and this tragedy is being posted all over the internet. Do I think that it is causing, it sparked national attention and national outrage and I do think that we are are seeing some what of a tipping point in terms of people saying that this is unacceptable. This type of violence against girls and women is not going to be tolerated by is society. If there is any positive at all I do think that we can see there is some hope that as a society we are starting to say that we are not going to tolerate this violence any more. 
>> Judge Jeanine: Do you think your client is going to get a fair trial? 
>> We believe that the the justice system will work how the justice system needs to work. That being said we are attempting to have the venue moved out of the steubenville area. 
>> Judge Jeanine: You will move for out of the steubenville area. The judge would go with the case? 

[00:49:21]


>> The judge would go with the case. 
>> Judge Jeanine: And you are hatchpy with this judge because he didn't move the case to his own court. 
>> He handled it accordingly. He is not from the area. A retired judge with a solid reputation throughout the state of ohio. 
>> Judge Jeanine: So i understand. Thanks for being with us this evening, both of you, may gin and brian. Up next, the "justice" expert panel breaks down the steubenville rape. Be sure to catch a special edition of on the record when jet that lookle at the rebuilding of -- when greta looks at the 

[00:53:13]


>>> this case is still under investigation. And it will be under investigation until the trial starts, more information will be presented. You have got a good judge that is a no nonsense judge handling the case and two prosecutors from the attorney general's office handling this case. 
>> Back with me is criminal defense attorney former prosecutor jeff gold. Psychologist dr. Jeffrey gardier and former nypd det hair halp. This case didn't even get investigated until the young girl's parents saw what was being posted online and they go to the police. Do you think there is any evidence that is being collected here? 
>> A nightmare for detectives especially after an alleged rape that she wasn't seen in the hospital and the rape kit wasn't conducted on her right away. Also the fact is what I'm hearing is that other evidence wasn't collected also. The fact that none of the evidence was taken from the two boys charged in this. Where is their underwear. Was the car taken, allegedly rape occurred in the car. Was the car impounded. As far as I'm hearing right now, none of that has been done. Sounds like there might have been a little bit of a screwup here. 
>> Judge Jeanine: What about the fact that you have eyewitnesses here and there are some of the high schoolers who have been -- who have indicated that this did happen. That this rape happened and they he have not been given immunity so they have no interest that. 
>> That is what I'm hearing. 
>> Judge Jeanine: That is devastating for the defense. 
>> Devastating for the defense, yes. 
>> Judge Jeanine: Before I get to the lawyer jeff. What does it tell you about these kids and I'm not even going to go near the underaged drinking party and the fact that there apparently was a coach who was hosting this stuff because I have had my own run-ins with these guys. What about the morals of these kids where she is basically unconscious or so it appears and doesn't remember anything as far as I read. They are saying pee on her. Urinate on her. One guy is saying what if she were your daughter and he says oh, she's dead to me. 

[00:55:26]


>> She is part of the commune the and she is drunk, let's help her. Let's not take advantage of her. 
>> Judge Jeanine: These boys are all american football players. What is their moral code? 
>> When we look at this kind of a situation, is it that football players once again are being coddled, are they being protected? Is football the game, the game in that town and therefore they he have a different standard, different morals and they are not raised the way they should. We have seen it happen over and over. 
>> Judge Jeanine: I have seen it a million times. Jeff is this the kind of case because it is in family court or juvenile court where the defense has an upper hand. 
>> They do. Once they won a hearing to not bring it up to adult court the worse that could happen to the kids is to stay in juvenile until 21. A huge victory no matter what happens in the casey anthony case, even if convict. 
>> Jury or no jury. 
>> An open hearing which is interesting. 
>> That s interesting. Tearing the town apart which s really very sad. Thanks so much for being with us, guys. 
>> Thanks for having us. 
>> Judge Jeanine: Now, we go to the instapoll results. A whopping 82% gave a resounding, yes. Now, that is a whopping 82% who said, yes, he did they put the gun owners in danger. Not whether they should have printed it. But did they put us in danger. What sanctimonious ego maniac. Carmen wrote how does it feel you journal news dummies. You scared? Hire armed guards. 
>> And katie tweeted this could get ugly if they do gun grabs. Hey, they outed me. I didn't publish it.

??????Suzanne takes you down  ??????
to her place near the river You can hear the boats go by You can spend the night beside her And you know, she's half crazy That's why you want to be there She feeds you tea and oranges That come all the way from China And just when you mean to tell her You have no love to give her She gets you on her wavelength And she lets the river answer You've always been her lover And you want to travel with her You want to travel blind And know she will find you For you've touched her perfect body with your mind Yes and Jesus was a sailor When He walked upon the water And He spent a long time watching From a lonely wooden tower And when He knew for certain Only drowning men could see Him He said, all men will be sailors then Until the sea shall free them But He, Himself was broken Long before the sky would open Forsaken, almost human He sank beneath your wisdom like a stone And you want to travel with him You want to travel blind And you know he you can trust him For he's touched your perfect body with his mind

Suzanne takes your hand She leads you to the river She is wearing rags and feathers From Salvation Army counter And the sun pours down like honey On our lady of the harbor Shews you where to look Amid the garbage and the flowers There are heroes in the seaweed There are children in the morning They are leaning out for love They will lean that way forever While Suzanne holds the mirror And you want to travel with her You want to travel blind And you know she will trust you For she's touched your perfect body with

It's coming through a hole in the air, from those nights in Tiananmen Square. It's coming from the feel that this ain't exactly real, or it's real, but it ain't exactly there. From the war against disorder, from the sirens night and day, From the fires of the homeless, from the ashes of the gay: Democracy is coming to the U.S.A. It's coming through a crack in the wall; on a visionary flood of alcohol; from the staggering account of the Sermon on the Mount which I don't pretend to understand at all. It's coming from the silence on the dock of the bay, from the brave, the bold, the battered heart of Chevrolet: Democracy is coming to the U.S.A. It's coming from the sorrow in the street, the the holy places where the races meet; from the homicidal bitchin' that goes down in every kitchen to determine who will servd who will eat. From the wells of disappointment where the women kneel to pray for the grace of God in the desert here and the desert far away:

Democracy is coming to the U.S.A. Dino Soldo on the buzzharp   Sail on, sail on O mighty Ship of State!  ??????
To the Shores of Need Past the Reefs of Greed Through the Squalls of Hate Sail on, sail on, sail on. It's coming to America first, the cradle of the best and of the worst. It's here they got the range and the machinery for change and it's here they got the spiritual thirst. It's here the family's broken and it's here the lonely say that the heart has got to open in a fundamental way: Democracy is coming to the U.S.A. It's coming from the women and the men. O darlin', we'll be making love again. We'll be going down so deep the river's going to weep, and the mountain's going to shout Amen! 

[00:37:31]


It's coming like the tidal flood beneath the lunar sway, imperial, mysterious, in amorous array: Democracy is coming to the U.S.A. Sail on, sail on O mighty Ship of State! To the Shores of Need Past the Reefs of Greed Through the Squalls of Hate Sail on, sail on, sail on. I'm sentimental, if you know what I mean I love the country but I can't stand the scene. And I'm neither left or right I'm just staying home tonight, getting lost in that hopeless little screen. But I'm stubborn as those garbage bags that Time cannot decay, I'm junk but I'm still holding up this little wild bouquet: Democracy is coming to the U.S.A.

[?????? Theme music ??????] 
>>> welcome to "live life and win!"! 
>> I'm madisen hill and we invite you to join us as we EXPLORE OUT TO LIVEhLIFE AND Win. 
>> We'll feature inspirational story, demonstrating how hard-work ethic, commitment, and perseverance can allow teens to live life and win. 
[ Cheers and applause ] 
>> we have lift off! ????????? ?????? extraordinary ?????? ?????? now you have got to live life and win ?????? 
>> this week on "live life and win!"! 
>> My name is drake hougo, I am 14 yoors old and I live life and win by helping hers live fit and healthy lives. 
>> Hi my name is kimberly anyadike and I live life and win by spreading my wings. 
>> Drake hougo is a boy scout who thinks big, and for two years committed himselves to improving the lives of adults in his community. ???????????? 
>> this is drake hougo. He runs cross-country, and plays volleyball, soccer, and baseball. He is also a boy scout and a student with a 4.0 grade point average. This 12 year old is anything but a regular kid. He had a vision and turned himself into a super-teen. This is how it all began. 
>> The obesity rate is rising, and I don't want this to be a valley of overweight people. Fitness is very important to me. 

[00:02:09]


>> Drake wanted to encourage his neighbor's fitness, so he came up with the idea. 
>> When I was at the park one time, playing soccer, I saw all of these parents sitting around watching their kids, and I'm thinking, hey, we're getting a workout, where weren't the parents getting a workout, so i figured putting something in here that they can use that is fitness, related would be great. I really wanted to give something big back to my community, and I felt that fitness was the most important thing. 
>> Drake's vision was to create a fitness zone of workout machines in his local city park. 
>> When I first started my eagle scout project, I was 12 years old. I did not know what I was signing up for. I did not know what big of a commitment it would be. 
>> It was a big project with many stages. Let's follow drake's two-year journey. 
>> Complete the fitness zone went through several different phases, starting out with developing the idea, getting idea approved through the boy scout troop and the city as well, then fund-raising, raising all of the money I could, and then coordinating volunteers, ordering the equipment, assembling new equipment, installing the equipment. 
>> That's a lot for a 12 year old. 
>> Part of my concern was i didn't know what I was doing that much. I knew I was going to be putting equipment in, but how I would put it in, or who was going to put it in. So there were all of these details I didn't know how to answer. 
>> He had a variety of fitness machines in his zone. However, machines like this are not cheap. 
>> I had to raise 13,150 dollars. I set up a station called adopt a station. And put the actual price tag, and I said if companies donate to my cause, they adopt a piece of equipment, and their name will be put on the fitness zone sign. 

[00:04:26]


>> Drake's solution was to make advertising pay for his project, but he had to sell the advertising. 
>> The fund-raising was strenuous and difficult. There were times that I was hung up on. I would spend like four -- about four hours making phone calls and sending emails, and I would get nothing, and this went on for about a three-month period, and all of a sudden the money started to slowly come in until I was finally at $13,000. 
>> Next was finding and buying the equipment. 
>> In order to purchase the equipment, I dealt with outdoor fitness company. We decided they were the best to go to because they had the best price. 
>> Drake couldn't afford to hire contractors to install the equipment, but he did have some adults and his scout troop help him. 
>> We did this all over memorial day weekend. We assembled the equipment, so that was one day, and then we came on thursday, just my dad and i, and laid out all of the equipment. Three, we dug all the holes out, four, we pored the concrete, and four we moved the equipment in, and five we moved the mulch back. This was one of the harder pieces to install. Funny story about this one was it was crazy to install, because you had to line it ip correctly in the concrete, so we had to bring it back, level it up, and that took forever. 
>> Here are some statistics from drake on all of the work his volunteers did. 
>> My work included 1,036 hours of community service, including the volunteers who installed it, 11 pieces of physical exercise equipment, around 13 cubic yards of concrete. 10,200 spent on equipment, the other cost on installation and food. 

[00:06:45]


>> How did the 12-year-old handle the stress for such a long time? 
>> When I started in october of 2010, and right now I'm a completely different person. I was very young and immature and I had to rise to the occasion, take risks and i learned a lot. I think it really depends on how much you really want to do it. I wanted to make an addition to my community. 
>> But there was one virtue that really made the difference. 
>> The key to the success was the idea and a lot of perseverance. This took two really difficult years, a lot of no, I can't hang out with you, no, I can't go to magic mountain with you, and it was tough, I had to and persevere through it. Whenever I was down, I would go to one of my favorite roll models, john wooden, and look at his quotes, so I figured I just got to keep pushing and pushing and worng hard, because I know the lend come, and I just got to persevere through it. 
>> And drake got it done, and the zone has been a great success. Users range from hard core fitness types to kids just having fun. 
>> I use it seven days a week. 
>> So what reward has drake earned? 
>> The first reward I get is just the self satisfaction in knowing I put the equipment in. That's the biggest reward, and coming to the park and seeing people working on it, that was pretty big too. The most climatic moment of the entire journey was when I cut the ribbon, I was able to take a deep breath and just be like, dang that is one heck of a ride. 
>> And during that ride, drake learned these valuable lessons. 
>> If you put your mind to something, there's nothing you can't do. You can leave an impact. 

[00:08:50]


>> Drake also had a message for adults. 
>> Work hard and improve your self body image. Lose some weight. It will make you and your family happy, and your life better. 
>> After his own two-year workout, drake has a clear vision of what he wants to be. 
>> I really want to be a personal [ inaudible ]. I want to be someone who when you walk away, you go wow that's a really good person. 
>> Well, madisen, drake is an impressive young man. Smart, integrity and grit help him realize his vision. Up next we'll go flying with special teens in this special ?????? live life and win, live your life ?????? 

[00:12:21]


>> welcome back to "live life and win!." Where teens are assessing change, and as you are about to see, not your ordinary teens. 
>> Imagine your ten, 11, 12, and you want to fly an airplane. Well where do you go? We found a museum, tomorrow's aeronautical museum, who lets kids do it for free. ???????????? 
>> it's a bird's eye view you can only get from a helicopter. We are flying high above compton. ???????????? 
>> now we're even higher. We're flying in a single-engine, fixed wing plane, and I have never felt safer. I am flying with a record-setting pilot, and another one with years of experience. You may be surprised when you see who they really are. 
>> My name is kimberly anyadike, and I'm 15 years old. 
>> This is how we live life and win. 
>> That's right. You hear them correctly. As they are kids. That's are all pilots. Two of them not old enough to get a driver's license. 
>> We can fly, but we can't drive. I don't understand it. 
>> They are part of an after-school program at tomorrow's aeronautical museum. It's a playland for kids. Kids as young as eight get to earn flight time, and it doesn't cost a dime. 
>> When I first started the museum, I thought, man, I maybe shouldn't be standing in the way of a kid being successful. I'm going to let a kid fly. I met some men at an air show, and they were telling me about the idea that they have, if you could get kids involved in aviation, it would be a national alternative to destruction. We have a contract that you have to sign. The contracted says that you cannot do drugs. You can't get expelled from school. Your lowest grade, you have to raise it a letter grade, and we'll provide tutoring to help you do that. And they have to obey their parents. If the parents they say that are not doing what they told them to do, they are out of the program. Kids can come down here and do work like wash airplanes, answer phones. 

[00:15:14]


>> The kids e credited at $5 an hour called a museum fund. Once they collect enough dollars, they can trade museum dollars for flight time. 
>> I just learned that the sky really is no longer the limit. 
>> That's is 17-year-old, kimberly anyadike. And she has learned her lessons well. She first stepped on to the museum grounds five years ago. 
>> I set a world record by becoming the youngest african american female to pilot 
[ inaudible ]. 
>> You heard her. 15, coast-to-coast. To get a better understanding of how things work, I have got to check it out myself. I'm getting the full tour. The history of the museum, learning about the achievent of past students. 
>> How many records have you set? 
>> Just a couple. ???????????? 
>> and this is this flight simulator. 
>> Now it's my turn. It's a lot heard harder than it looks. What is the difference between the simulator and the real plane. It is pretty similar? 
>> Yeah, it is pretty similar. 
>> You guys are doing a lot of flying in real life, though. 
>> Yeah, it's fun. Now when you are on final, this is the tricky part. 
>> This is terrifying and I'm not really even in the sky. 
>> I can tell you the hardest part is the takeoff, flying and the landing. 
>> That was a good landing. 
>> Thank you. Thank you. 
>> Don't touch that remote. 
>> We have shown you how one teen affected change, and others who are not your ordinary teens. 

[00:17:16]


>> Coming uping up part two of how the sky is the limit for some dedicated teens. scalp, science. You're history. Selsun blue itchy dry scalp. Gets to the root of dandruff and hydrates the scalp. Selsun blue itchy dry scalp. symptoms period. ?????? ?????? pain relievers -- they don't compare. Pamprin's not just pain relief. It's period relief. nights. Sthes you to sleep with ingredients like melatonin. It's safe with no side effects, so you wake up... Ready to go. 
[ Male Announcer ] UNISOM NATURAL NIGHTS. ?????? Live your life and win ?????? 

[00:19:38]


>> welcome back to "live life and win!" The series celebrating teen success stories. 
>> Now we're going to learn more on how tomorrow's aeronautical museum is helping kids reach for the sky. 
>> This is the hangar. That is the tomahawk right there. 
>> And have you guys ever flown one of these? 
>> Not yet. I hope to. 
>> Most of our planes are 
[ inaudible ] tails. 
>> Each plane is dedicated to airmen. So you see their name will be on the side. 
>> This is one that kimberly flew. 
>> Can we take a look inside? 
>> Of course. 
>> The tour is absolutely amazing. Most people never get this close to planes and helicopters. 
>> I usually use a booster seat. 
[ Laughter ] 
>> this is the plane they flew cross country. There is a nonprofit flight organization, and in exchange for community service hours, question get flight time. 
>> So you have to wash planes? ???????????? 
>> unfortunately this is as close as I'll get to flying a plane today. Perhaps most impressive are the kids themselves. Very smart, driven and responsible. Macarthur really uses the program as an escape. He suffers from sickle-cell anemia. What it is like flying? 
>> I don't worry about my stomach anymore. 
>> You just feel like you are free? 
>> This program works. 
>> I USED TO HAVE Ds AND Fs, AND This program has gotten me on track. I graduated from middle school with a 4.0. If I weren't coming to the program, I would probably be in a gang or stuff like that, and be a failure in school. I wouldn't want to go to school no more, and now I'm flying above anything. 

[00:21:55]


>> James knox is another prize student. 
>> This is one of my favorite places to be. 
>> James is a success too. He has over come a lot, mostly his fears. 
>> The first time I went flying, my stomach like -- everything -- I just dropped. I was like okay. I was nervous. 
>> That's not the story anymore. He knows what he wants to make of his life. 
>> Most likely I could see myself in the air force. 
>> And he owes it all to this program. 
>> Anything you want to do, no matter what it is, you can do it as long as you put any work and time in. 
>> As for kimberly anyadike and all of the other record setters, robin sums it up best. 
>> They are very humble because they know there are 30 other kids here that could have done the exact same thing. 
>> And kimberly takes it all in stride, still soft-spoken. 
>> I have an opportunity that most people don't have, and i really appreciate it all the more. My message to all kids is you can do anything that you set your hearts too. You can achieve anything as long as you pursue it with diligence and persistence. 
>> She wants to be a cardiovascular surgeon for her career. Robin runs a little flight school in compton, california, and does his best to mentor kids and keep them out of trouble. 
>> The big lesson they learn here is I can. I can do anything if I put my mind to it. Kids who I know would have wound up in jail, kids who I know would have wound up a dropout, kids who have a strong feeling that they probably would have been killed because of the stuff that they were doing, that I now see having jobs, that I now see are parents and responsible parents. Those accomplishments make me more proud than setting the word records. 

[00:24:08]


>> Robin petgrave always drives home this point, if you have passion for something, it's never work. It is pure joy. ???? ???????????? 

[00:27:01]

>> You just trip over something? 
>> I don't remember. 
>> You don't remember? Did somebody help you fall? A prison inmate is covering up his own brutal beating. 
>> I don't like you using the same one that everyone is using because you bring that funk into my cell. 
>> Two cell mates share. 
>> I go by a dumpster and i wonder. I wonder is that one of my daughter's last resting places. 
>> ?????? Everybody locked up. 
>>> Plucked from death row an inmate tries to make a difference. 
>> Note amazing grace. 
>> At the end of the day life is about choices. All of this stuff is an illusion. 
>>> Indiana's wabash valley correctional facility houses nearly 2,200 inmates. More than one-third of them are doing time for serious violent crimes. Unless isolated in solitary confinement, the vast majority of inmates live in two-man cells. Pairings are critical, and avoiding a volatile mix of cellmates a constant challenge. 

[00:02:07]


>> We try to not put people doing life with people who are going home next year or blacks with whites or white supremist where with someone with a child molestation case just to resolve the conflict before it happens. 
>> But even with careful screening, conflicts can still arise between cellmates. 
>> It was reported we had an assault. There's a guy in the infirmary who's received several injuries to his facial and head area, and at this point he's saying he just had a seizure. So at this point we're going to go over and try to talk to him. I think we discovered he may have been assaulted with a hot pot. We're going to talk to him and see if he is willing to talk at all. 
>> The victim is curt its cash who is serving a 29-year sentence for burglary. 
>> Cash? 
>> Yeah. 
>> What's up with you, man? 
>> You can stay laid down if you want to? What happened to you, bud? 
>> Fell. 
>> Where? 
>> In my cell. 
>> Did you get dizzy? 
>> Yeah. 
>> Did you have a seizure? 
>> I don't remember. 
>> Have you fell like this before? 
>> No. 
>> Do you have a medical condition that would make you fall? 
>> No. 
>> You just trip over something? 
>> I don't remember. 
>> You don't remember? Did somebody help you fall? 
>> No. 
>> No? Is it safe to assume that probably something more than you falling happened that you just don't want to talk about? 
>> I don't -- 
>> who do you live with? 
>> Woods. 
>> Woods? 
>> Yeah. 
>> What's his first name? 
>> I don't know? 
>> How long have you guys lived together? 
>> Probably eight months. 
>> Eight months. And you think you're safe going back to the same cell you was in? 
>> Yeah. 
>> You don't think you'll fall again? 
>> No. 
>> You think for whatever reason you fell for this time is over with and you won't fall more? 
>> Should be. 
>> You understand where I'm coming from. We've got to protect you. 
>> Yeah, I understand. 
>> You don't want to talk about what happened? 
>> Trying to get medical attention. 
>> I will get you nixed up. They have done x-raies right? 

[00:04:08]


>> He reported he fell in his cell, which is typical in prison instead of these guys wanting to snip on anybody they'll say they fell ohad a seizure or hit their head playing basketball. These look like substantial injuries. It looks like his jaw is broken or his orbital is fractured. Staff think that something was done with a hot pot. There was a hot pot inside cell that was broke. The cellmate is in cuffs. We'll go over to him and see what he's got to say. 
>> The cellmate is dana woods, serving 70 years for aggravated battery and criminal confinement. 
>> Apparently there was a little incident in the cell and we want to talk to you about. 
>> The man fell. 
>> Substantial injuries for just falling. 
>> I'm sure the man had epileptic seizures and they found him on the floor. 
>> There was a lot of blood -- a lot of blood in the ce. 
>> Right. He had a good gash on his head. 
>> How did the hot pot get broke? 
>> The hot pot? 
>> It was in the cell. 
>> We were fixing a hot pot before and it had been in the trash the whole time. 
>> I can tell you I've been here 15 years and nobody just had a fall that looked like that. 
>> He fell on the bed. 
>> I'm not going to tell you what he told me just like i wouldn't tell anybody else what you told me if you were beat up. That kind of puts people's lives in danger. I'm not going to start doing that now. He might have told me he fell and might have said you beat the 
[ bleep ] out of him. 
>> That didn't happen. 
>> You are running around here assaulting people, and I'm convinced you did this. It's not a simple fall. But you're not going to man up and tell me why it happened? 
>> The man sprayed blood all over the place. 
>> That's not the truth at all and we both know it. So -- I'll -- I'll make different housing arrangements for you if you don't want to actually tell me what was going on. He's maintaining the story that nothing happened, that he didn't do anything, the guy fell. So at this point, you know, we'll go in and I'm going to look at the cell and see what it looks like. 

[00:06:37]


>> While violence between cellmates is always a possibility in prison, for philip and curtis, living together has had the opposite effect. 
>> Is that that diabetic peanut butter? 
>> It has no taste to it. 
>> Put the cookie on the peanut butter. 
>> I have to get rid of this stomach. 
>> All right. 
>> Dear heavenly father, lord, we thank you for this meal. 
>> Old curt. Curt is a good brother, man. He's a gentle giant. He brought a lot of balance into my life. We have been cellies for almost two years. 
>> Stroud never imagined he'd have a cellmate. He used to be housed on indiana's death row, living alone in a cell awaiting execution. 
>> I'm in prison for three counts of murder, three counts of robbery, and two counts of dealing in cocaine. I spent three years on death row. Went on a robbery. Half a million-dollar score. It was a residence, a safe. Three people -- three innocent people end up losing their life when they didn't have to. They didn't deserve to. 
>> Stroud's victims were contractors working at the home stroud and his accomplices robbed. Stroud ordered the men tied up and shot each in the head with a pistol. 
>> When I first walked on death row, the thing that hit me first was the silence. The absolute silence. Walking on there was the type of silence that takes you in, the type of silence that's listening to you, watching your every move to see how you're going to respond to it. I came on the unit 23 years old, trying to project courage, confidence, and strength, but on the inside, I was upset. I was confused and I was afraid. The thing I remember the most was the cold concrete floor underneath my bare feet. And it just sitting on the edge of that bunk, man, and I just broke down and started crying and crying for all the people that I hurt, crying for justice, crying for my mother. You know what I mean? And during those three years, seven men, you know, were executed. They lost their lives. 

[00:09:57]


>> A change in indiana's capital punishment laws saved stroud from joining them. His sentence was commuted to three life terms without the possibility of parole. But stroud's salvation did not immediately make him a better inmate. 
>> I was the thug of them all. My pa said I was the chief among all sinners. I was the bully's bully. I could make things move how i wanted to make them move. That was just a gift that I had. 
>> That all chand when he found himself sharing a cell with McGrown who's serving 40 years for armed robbery and criminal confinement. 
>> When I first came over he was rough around the edges. Me being a mel low-type guy, I'm low key, god came through me to help straighten him out a little bit. 
>> Starting to thin out on the top. 
>> That's my sunroof. 
>> Your convertible. 
>> Bald-headed brothers is in. Women like bald-headed dudes. 
>> He's changed a whole lot. I'm proud that god used me to work with him after his reputation around the prison and on the street. 
>> I'm just thankful that I can be used, you know, and I got a brother like that that has brought so much balance to my life. 
>> JUST AS HE credits McGrown with helping him become a better man, stroud says he's determined to pay it forward. He spends his free time tutoring other inmates like keno austin who's trying to earn his ged. 
>> What is the answer? 
>> The front. 
>> No. 
>> The opposite of left is -- 
>> I'm tripping. 
>> Don't get [ indiscernible ] no. 
>> We just here trying to offer critical thinking skills, you know, conflict resolution, ways to settle disputes without resorting to violence, just use the platform and the credibility that we do from our past lives to try to effect positive change on these youngsters' lives in here and on the streets. You doing good, man. Man, you catch on quick. 
>> For real. 
>> For real. 
>>> Coming up, two cellmates with two unthinkable crimes. 
>>> And later -- 
>> what have you seen so far? 

[00:11:57]


>> Surveillance footage provides a new view as investigators try to figure out what happened to curtis cash, whether his cellmate should bear the blame. from Is bigger than we think ... like the flu. With aches, fever and chills- the flu's a really big deal. So why treat it like it's a little cold? There's something that works differently than over-the-counter remedies. Prescription TAMIFLU attacks the flu virus at its source. So don't wait. Call your doctor right away. TAMIFLU is prescription medicine for treating the flu in adults and children one year and older whose flu symptoms started within the last two days. Before taking TAMIFLU tell your doctor if you're pregnant, nursing. have serious health conditions, or take other medicines. If you develop an allerg reaction, a severe rash, or signs of unusual behavior, stop taking TAMIFLU and call your doctor immediately. Children and adolescents in particular may be at an increased risk of seizures, confusion or abnormal behavior. The most common side effects are mild to moderate nausea and vomiting. The flu comes on fast, so ask your doctor about TAMIFLU. Prescription for flu.

>>> At indiana's wabash valley correctional facility most of the inmates live in two-man cells, and like any two people sharing close quarters, cleanliness is vital. 
>> Why are you sweeping with your hands? 
>> I don't like using the same broom everybody uses because then I'm just bringing their funk into my cell. 
>> When do you think we're doing spring cleaning? 
>> It's not going to be today. I'm already cleaning the floor. 
>> I was just asking. 
>> I will make time for it sometime over the weekend. 
>> Sunday. Just do it sunday. 
>> All right. 
>> Cellmates for a year, these two might have different priorities, but they share the stigma of having separately committed unthinkable crimes. 
>> From day one I've known that the things that I've done even among criminals was way, way off it, you know, the end of the deep end. When I was younger, I was a very, very bad person. Something was broken. And I just -- I didn't think like other kids my age did. 
>> Trowbridge was 14 years old the day he was brought to prison. He was high on inhalents. His victim was a 69-year-old female neighbor working in the backyard of her trailer home. 
>> I see that her front door is open and me being the person that I was, that clicked. Okay. Go get some money. And that was my intent when i went up in there. And she came in and she actually scared me when she came in because I didn't know that she came in. And I attacked her, and i sexually assaulted her, and i killed her. And I robbed her. And I left. The poor woman didn't stand a chance. 

[00:17:54]


>> Prosecutors determined that trowbridge not only strangled his victim but sexually assaulted her after her death. He was sentenced to 77 years for robbery, murder, and abuse of a corpse. He has already served 15 and with good behavior could be out of prison by age 50. He currently lives in wabash's protective custody unit which houses inmates whose lives could be at risk in general population due to the nature of their crimes. Trowbridge's cellmate, joshua bean, shares the same unusual pairing of convictions, murder and abuse of a corpse. He's serving 68 years. The victim was his ex-girlfriend, heather norris. 
>> It was a toxic relationship. It was love/hate, and I still very much love her. 
>> Throughout the couple's three-year relationship, heather had told her family that bean was physically abusive, and even though bean faced a pending trial on domestic abuse charges at the time of heather's murder, he says he wasn't abusive. 
>> The whole thing was predicated on a lie, and the lie is that we had a violent relationship. I'm not saying I'm without fault. But as far as what happened with her death, worst case, voluntary manslaughter. Best case, self-defense. 
>> Bean insists the come had an argument and heather came at him with a knife. 
>> I tried to pry the knife out of her hand, and even still after I had the knife, she continued to come forward. That kind of caught me off guard. And in the heat of the moment, i reacted. I stabbed her in the side right here. 

[00:19:57]


>> But according to court records, bean had confessed to a friend that he stabbed heather several times and slit her throat. No one knows for sure because her body was never recovered. 
>> I decided to try to do something with the body. I thought, well, cremation. But at the time I didn't know the specifics behind it. So I made an attempt to burn her body. A botched attempt. I ended up buying a chain saw. That's what people can't get past. Is what happened after. 
>>> Coming up, the mother of josh bean's victim speaks out. 
>> I go by a dumpster and i wonder if that's one of my daughter's last resting places. 
>>> But first -- 
>> looks like he tried to clean the blood up before the staff arrived. There is blood on the bedding and some on the back window. 
>> Investigator little john tries to determine if the cell is an accident scene or a crime scene.

>>> At indiana's wabash valley correctional far the m-house cellblock has been put on shutdown until investigators can determine the cause of cash's severe facial injuries. Both cash and his cellmate woods claim that cash simply fell. But internal investigator frank little john suspects a cover-up. 

[00:24:56]


>> The suspect probably told the victim don't tell on me. Tell them you fell. 
>> Littlejohn suspects that woods might have used the hot pot to assault his cellmate. 
>> The hot pot was down in the trash. 
>> Littlejohn's next step is to investigate the cell itself. 
>> It looks like -- obviously you can see a little blood here. It looks like he tried to clean the blood up actually before the staff arrived. There's blood on the bedding, some of the back window. So it was probably a little struggle. It looks like he's already packed his property, so he knew. That's pretty typical. They pack their stuff up so the officers don't get things mixed up. He is ready to go to segregation. He knew he would be going. 
>> Little john also checked cell house surveillance footage. While there is no coverage inside the cell, he wants to rule out the possibility of another assailant entering the cell. 
>> What have you seen? 
>> Nobody goes up or comes out. 
>> Nobody has been in or out between breakfast or lunch. 
>> You see the officers are at the cell. This is offender cash. He's the offender with the injuries. This is the cellmate coming out. 
>> The video doesn't show anything as far as the assault taking place. It shows that nobody entered or exited the cell other than the two and they didn't come out for breakfast or for lunch. Whatever happened inside the cell. 
>> Woods was taken to the custody control unit where he will be locked into a single-person cell 23 hours day pending the results of the investigation. 
>> Go ahead and strip down. Socks and everything. Everything. Put that on. 
>> They put us in a room. They don't give us no manual to teach us how to live in a box with another man. It's really hard. It's really hard, man. Especially when they have a seizures and get hurt in their cells, you get blamed for it.

>> at the end of the day, life is about choices. All of this stuff is an illusion, the life I led on the streets, the dope dealing, the gang banging, the getting drunk and getting high. If you really want to keep it real, you've got to make better choices than the ones you made. It can lead you down one of three paths, death, a life in prison, or an empty existence on the streets. 
>> One-man band for our first go-around. 
>> While stroud uses music to escape the restraints of prison, many others turn to drugs. And despite the efforts of staff, drure smuggled into the prison. Traffic and abuse pose security problems. Security officers conduct surprise shakedowns to find drugs. Inmates are also required to give urine samples. Today's target is the protective custody unit. 
>> Two-man teams. Bring them out and set them down. 504. 
>> Remember, these guys are all in protective custody, so a little space between them. 
>> Opposite end. 
>> Among those to to be searched and tested are two of wabash's more high-profile inmates, joshua bean and dustin trowbridge. 
>> Open 504. 
>> Shortly after bean and trowbridge are allowed back this their cell, corrections office return to administerhe drug tests. 

[00:37:50]


>> We test for eight different drugs, morphine, oxy, meth, pcp, cocaine, amphetamines, meth amphetamine, and marijuana. 
>> Bean. 
>> The containers are desi with a drug detection patch that provides immediate results. All right. Bean, right? I have you showing positive for methamphetamine. That's what you're testing for. You want it sent to the lab. 
>> Send it to the lab. There's no way. 
>> If an inmate tests positive, he can request a second test from an outside lab. Bean is confident it is because of a prescription drug he's allowed to take. 
>> I'm on wellbutrin. 
>> Getting narcotics or anything like that back here is next to impossible, so, you know, i don't have a doubt when it goes to the lab, I'll be all right. 
>> For bean, a positive drug test could result in a transfer out of the protective custody unit where the high-profile nature of his crime, the murder of his ex-girlfriend and destroying her corpse could make him a target among other inmates. 
>> I haven't been anywhere, in the county or prison, where i hadn't run into someone who knew who I was or seen this stuff, the news on the case. It follows you everywhere. I tested positive for pot maybe a year or two ago and they took me to a disciplinary unit in g-house. I was over there for a half hour and had four or five people say, look, if you don't get out of here, we're just going to straight stab you. 
>>> Coming up, investigators reach conclusions on both curtis cash and bean. $100,000. We asked total strangers to watch it for us. Thank you so much. I appreciate it. I'll be right back.

[00:43:18]


>>> It's been nearly a week since wabash valley inmate dana woods has been accused of brutally beating his cellmate. Curtis cash suffered a broken jaw and a bloody face. Since then woods has been on a 23-hour lockdown in the custody control unit as internal affairs completed his inveion. 
>> It appeared on the scene when we arrived that cash had been assaulted by woods with a hot spot. He sustained lacerations to his face, multiple bruising to his neck and all over his body where it appeared to us that he had been kicked. 
>> But both cellmates are sticking to the same story, that cash's injuries were the result of falling down in the cell. 
>> Because of the lack of cooperation from the alleged assailant and the alleged victim, we did not file any external or internal charges on mr. Woods or mr. Cash. 
>> Both of these guys have a lot of years left in prison. So it's normal for the victim not to want to talk. He's not going to want to be labeled as a snitch. That will further the probability of being assaulted in the future. He is maintaining the story that he fell. 
>> Woods was released from the custody control unit and returned to general population. But he's been given a new cell assignment in a new housing unit. 
>> You've got to get along in here. You've got to. 
>> Yeah. We get along good. 
>> Have you seen cash since the altercation? 
>> No. He's on the other side of the prison. 
>> Did you guys leave on good terms? 
>> Of course. 
>> Over in the protective custody unit, joshua bean has received word on his ongoing investigation. After testing positive for meth am get mean during a recent shakedown, bean requested an outside lab conduct its own test. The results came back negative backing up bean's claims. I take wellbutrin. Pretty much anyone who takes wellbutrin in here tests positive for methamphetamines. Thanks. 

[00:45:27]


>> You're welcome. 
>> That's what I figured it would be from the beginning. I knew I wasn't doing anything. 
>> Open your mouth. Thank you. 
>> Although the drug creates problems whenever he's tested, according to bean it's become his lifeline. He says he needs the medication to cope with the anxiety and stress of being incarcerated for the murder of his girlfriend. 
>> And, you know, just when i think I have a grip on it, these wounds are scar tissue. I thought it was healed, but it just opens back up all over again. And you know I'm -- sometimes partially in tears, sometimes i just want to hit the off switch when't have one. There's no on and off to a lot of this kind of stuff. It happens when it happens, you know, and I east just got to deal with it. 
>> On the eve of his 30th birthday, bean's cellmate dustin trowbridge has spent nearly half of his life in prison for murdering and assaulting a 69-year-old woman. He, too, attempts to make peace with the past. 
>> I didn't used to like myself. I had a lot of hatred toward myself for a long time. On the back of my arms it says "freak of nature." You know, I started seeing things completely different. I started understanding things different too. And I changed, you know. I don't want to say it's because I found god or anything like that because truthfully that all came afterward. That didn't come until years after I figured out what a piece of grab I really used to be. 
>>> Coming up -- 
>> I can never ask you to forgive me.

>>> more than 2,000 inmates are housed behind the walls of wabash valley correctional facility. But housing assignments are temporary as cellmates shroud and McGrown have just found out they were moved from their larger corner cell to a smaller one on the other side of the unit. Inging 
>> why did they move you out of the corner area? 
>> Did you see the dude in that cell now? 
>> He's a little bit bigger. I think he needs that cell more than we did. 
>> You think they moved you out of that cell because there was a bigger guy moving in? 
>> I think it was a handicapped cell. We're both kind of small. I'm bigger than him, but the guy bigger than me needed that cell more than me. Inging they looked like they was in a matchbox when we moved in here. 
>> But for stroud the only thing that changed is the view. 
>> To me it's all prison. You know, that's how I look at it. Whether the cell was ten times this size or half this size, i might have been in worse situations. I just look at it like we are still in prison and can't go home. The only environment is this environment right here, you know what I mean. I got a nice view. I got a view they look out of now, and it really -- it really 
-- 
>> step over here so you can see. 
>> To any young person or anybody who thinks that coming to prison is cool or whatever -- come here. That's what I got to look at for the rest of my life. Those wires. That might be the closest that i ever get to freedom. It's close, but it's far away. That's what lockup is. That is what my extended stay is like. That's for real. That's real life. It's not high like in the movies. It ain't none of that, man. This is my bed. When I look out the window, that's what I see. 

[00:53:11]


>> Dustin trowbridge keeps a unique record of the cells he's occupied over the last 15 years. I wrote down where I was every birthday that I had since I been in here. 15th was in the drunk tank in the county jail. 16th was in the cell above me. 17th was over here on the right side. 18th was on the right side. 
>> Trowbridge has decided to mark his 30th birthday by writing a letter to the elderly woman he robbed, murdered, and sexually assaulted. 
>> I can never ask you to forgive me for the horrible things I did to you. I can't find it in me to forgive myself. I am sorry. I'm sorry I stole your sense of security when I snuck in your home. I'm sorry I stole your sense of accomplishment and endeavors. I'm sorry I stole your dignity. I'm sorry I stole you from your loved ones when I very cowardly took the very life god gave you. There's really no words that can express how sorry I am. To those who knew and loved 
[ bleep ], I'm sorry. I will not ask for forgiveness either. Every day for over half my life not a moment has gone by when i didn't hang my head in gnd shame. That's it. 
>> Why did you feel the need to write that? 
>> Well, I think it was -- this was as much for myself as it was for anybody else's sake. I -- this is probably going to sound kind of silly, but i really didn't -- couldn't comprehend death until someone i knew -- until I had experienced that loss. And it -- it kind of put things in a completely different perspective when my grandma died. 

[00:55:28]


>> Trowbridge's cellmate, joshua bean, also wrote a letter to his victim, heather, his former girlfriend, whom he stabbed to death. I can't push these emotions to the darkest most solitaire place in my mind anymore. I've suppressed so much. Now your parents think I abused and beat you on multiple occasions, and now your friends think I controlled you and forced do you be with me. I'm so far from abusive sometimes I find it hard to believe how I wound up where i am. I never wanted anything other than your love, babe. I never would have hurt you. Yet you are dead and I might as well be. 
>> But debby norris, heather's mother says that bean is a liar. 
>> I know that heather was beaten by him at least four times, four times that were pretty bad. One time she ended up going to the hospital after a beating. Two of those beatings she pressed charges, and he was arrested on one charge, and the other charge was pending when he killed her. 
>> Debby norris did not allow her daughter to die in vain. After heather's death she led the effort that resulted in the passing of heather's law, which made domestic violence education a requirement in indiana high schools. 
>> I'm trying to educate the young people on what a healthy relationship is and the signs that they need to look for and what do and that there's people out there that care and that there's resources for them to turn to. When you're in abusive relationship and you decide to go back, you're going to hear the words "i'm sorry," "i've changed," "i'll never do it again," I love you," and you do end up going back, and I believe that's what heather did.

>> I mean she loved me. I know she did. When she -- when she was -- after she got me, I had stabbed her right here, she lie down and I heard her in my arms and before she died, she said, i love you, and those were her last words. 
>> During his sentencing one of the things that he did say was heathers last words were that i love you, josh. I will never believe that. I have nightmares that heather's last moments was calling out for me to help her because she had done that so many times before. I don't see where this would have been any different. 
>> One fact that is indisputable is that bean attempted to get away with murdering heather by dismembering her body with a chain saw and placing the parts in trash dumpsters throughout indianapolis. Heather's body was never recovered. 
>> I go by a dumpster, and i wonder if that's one of my daughter's last resting places. I see black trash bags, and it makes me sick. I hear a chain saw, and I have to get away. So much is different obviously. He took heather's life. But he took mine. He took her dad's. He took her family's. He took her friends'. Nobody is the same. Nobody has ever stopped missg heather

=======================================================

>>> Am I evil? Yes I am. 
>> One inmate walks a fine line between heaven and hell. After a decade in confinement -- 
>> it just strips the humanity away from you. 
>> One of indiana's most infamous inmates moves to general population. 
>> I couldn't believe it with his reputation that he has. 
>> Serving 100 years for a heinous crime, another inmate discovers a unique way to make amends. 
>> I believe that I've changed to tood. 
>> Be careful. 
>> That's my favorite rapper. He's the future. 
>> And a would-be rapper pays the price for attacking an officer. 
>> I've learned not to touch the police. They will touch you back. 
>> Welcome to wabash. Hope y'all could stay longer. 
>> With more than 2,000 inmates, the wabash valley correctional facility in southwestern indiana has a larger population and more acreage than the rest of the small town in which it's located. 
>> Carlisle is a very small community, approximately 1,200 is their population. It's comprised of a school. It has a grocery store. It has a gas station, a couple of little restaurants, a dollar store and that's really about all that's in carlisle. 
>> While carlisle might be a remnant of a simpler time, inside the twin security fences of wabash is evidence of how some aspects of society have grown harder. 

[00:02:05]


>> We're seeing a lot more offenders coming in much younger than they were before and much more violent than in the past as well. Correctional officers are the backbone of the facility. They're the ones dealing with the offenders on a daily basis. They are frontline. 
>> I've been hearing about the correction setting since I was 8 years old. I grew up around it. So coming in here was actually kind of easy for me. I already knew what to expect. I've heard all the war stories. 
>> OFFICER jarrod McMillan has been on the frontline at wabash for four years now. The war stories have come from his mother and father, both of whom are also on wabash's correction staff. 
>> It's the kind of environment that you don't want everybody in. I wouldn't let my daughter here but she's not meant for this. He's a little tougher. And my wife is real tough. They can handle it. 
>> But the younger officer McMILLAN WAS RECENTLY PUT TO THE Test. As he was escorting one inmate, another inmate unleashed a violent attack. 
>> He stuck his arm out with a bottle full of feces and urine and started flinging it everywhere, I had it on my face, my uniform, my pants. It was in the corner of my mouth. He actually got it in my mouth. I had to wait for somebody to come take pictures of it. So he could be prosecuted for that. Then I went up front and took a shower. They don't make enough soap to wash something like that out. I received a phone caluple of weeks ago and they told me everything was clear. 
>> There is an average of 15 officer assaults a year. This inmate recently contributed to that statistic. 
>> I just reacted and a verbal altercation turned physical. I was on my way to religious service actu. The officer was telling me, tie my shoes. And then I tied my shoes. He told me to tuck my shoelaces in my shoes. He told me to uncuff my pants. So I kind of got irritated. I'm like, I'm just going to religious service. 

[00:04:24]


>> Burke's victim, officer james manuel, has a different account. 
>> He was acting very arrogant and wouldn't let you speak to him. So I told him basically, I'm not arguing with you and directed him to go back to the housing unit. 
>> You see how they're doing me? 
>> A lieutenant who overheard the exchange ordered manuel to cuff burks and escort him back to his cell. 
>> Before I could get him, security turned around and punched me. 
>> I hit him in his face. While I was doing it, I was thinking in my mind, I just messed up. 
>> Then he hit me a couple of re timesh e handcuffs since he h one hanging loose on the other arm. 
>> Me and another officer heard the argument, started walking towards it when we heard it. In the process, the inmate turned around and knocked officer manuel down on the sidewalk. We came over, put the offender down on the ground, cuffed him up and escorted him to seg. 
>> I had to get stitches, had a cut on my forehead and my nose. 
>> Burks internally was charged th assault on the officer and resisting. It took three or four staff members to actually restrain him. 
>> As a result, burks was transferred from general population to the custody unit while officials determine what sanction he will receive. At a minimum, it will include a move to the secured confinement unit where inmates are housed 23 hours a day and lose many of their privileges, including contact visitation. Few people know more about how difficult life in confinement is than christopher trotter. After ten consecutive years there, he has been released to a transitional housing unit on his way back to general population. 
>> Probably known him for 12, 13 years. When I heard he was going to open pop, I couldn't believe it with his reputation that he has. I didn't think they would let him out. Oh, man. This is what I do all day long, drink ice water. It's been ten years since I had a cup of ice water. I was like, dang, I never knew that water tasted so good. But it does, just ice water. And these are the little things we take for granted. 

[00:07:00]


>> Trotter, whose name is infamous in the indiana state prison system, will now be around other inmates and staff without handcuffs and shackles for the first time in ten years. He originally came to prison nearly three decades earlier on a four-year sentence for theft. But then trotter received 142 years as a result of being one of the instigators of a major riot at another prison. He has spent a total of 16 years in confinement but says these last ten nearly broke him. 
>> That was some othe most torturous time I ever did in my life back there. And it took everything I had to keep it from dehumanizing me, demoralizing me and institutionalizing me. It strips the humanity away from you. I guess it's a good thing that i can't get emotional. It goes to show you that I'm not dead inside. I still feel. 
>>> Coming up -- 
>> I've always been told if you're not serving god, you're serving the devil. 
>> Serving time for a devilish ACT OF ARSON.GEICO's Emergency Roadside Assistance is there 24/7. Oh dear, I got a flat tire. Hmmm. Uh... yeah, can you find a take where it's a bit more dramatic on that last line, yeah? Yeah I got it right here. Someone help me!!! I have a flat tire!!! Well it's good... good for me. What do you think? GEICO. Fifteen minutes could save you fifteen percent or more on car insurance. like cereals. Fiber One. Uh, forgot Jack's cereal. 

[00:09:02]


[ Jack ] What's for breakfast? Um... Try the NumbeOne! Yeah, this is pretty good. 
[ Male Announcer ] Over a third of a day's fiber. Fiber One. ?????????????????????????????????????????????????? 

[00:11:42]


>>> like those at many other maximum security prisons, hundreds of inmates at indiana's wabash valley correctional facility seek to make a statement about themselves through tattoos. Some might use their ink to keep other inmates at a distance, to advertise their gang affiliation or the heinous act that brought them here. 37-year-old bill abbott got two of his more prominent tattoos prior to cominto wabash. Little did he know how ironic they would become. 
>> My horns. 
>> Why? What did you do bad? 
>> It was my way of life at the time. Not no evil or devil worshipping or nothing like that. I've always been told by all the christian family that I've known that if you're not serving god, you're serving the devil. I thought, that's going to be hard to do. If I can get them covered up with a halo, I would. But I don't think that will work. 
>> Can you show me what's on your forearms? 
>> It says, am I evil, yes I am. It's the name of a song metallica. They've been one of my favorite groups since I can remember. 
>> Abbott has been in and out of prison since he was 18. 
>> A lot of thefts. Possession of stolen property, receiving stolen properties. If it wasn't bolted down, you can't bolt it down, I'd buy it or sell it. 
>> But this time, abbott is at wabash for a more serious crime. He's serving 40 years for arson. He's convicted of burning down his hometown's historic catholic church, built in 1924. It happened in the predawn hours of easter morning. 
>> You have these tattoos, including horns on your head and "am I evil, yes, I am" on your forearms and then you get pulled in for burning down the church. 

[00:13:44]


>> Yeah, which didn't help any at all. 
>> Abbott says his troubles began the night before in a bar. 
>> I was pretty lit up. I ended up coming across two other individuals I hadn't seen for quite a few years and decided we was going to do some criminal mischief, I should say. And we decided to break into the church. 
>> Why in the world would you think of a church to break into? 
>> That was the alcohol talking and acting mostly. 
>> What did you take from there? 
>> A couple of pairs of shoes. They have tennis shoes for basketball and stuff like that. There was a couple of pairs of shoes and I had actually threw them in a bag. 
>> Abbott says he left before his friends and didn't know the church had burned down until hours later. 
>> Everything was still standing when I left. The next morning, my niece and my nephew and brother-in-law came in and told me to turn on the tv. I turned on the tv and every channel I flipped it on showed the catholic church on fire. 
>> Fingerprints on a church wine bottle led the police to him. Despite his claims of innocence, abbott says he took a plea deal to avoid testifying against his friends and being labeled a snitch. 
>> Going to prison having a snitch name is like having child molestation name. You just don't have it. They don't last long here. I wouldn't want to have the name snitch. I can't do it. 
>> Abbott's not alone in his claim that he is serving time only because he didn't want to snitch on someone else. Burks admitted to being in the car in a drive-by shooting. But he says he wasn't the trigger man. 
>> There's no award you get for not snitching. But I've done plenty of things in my life that would eventually lead me here or dead, you know what I mean? I believe god is punishing me now for everything that I did, in fact, do. So I'm just taking this time to learn from all the mistakes and right all those wrongs. 

[00:16:03]


>> Burks is serving a 55-year sentence for the murder of a south african immigrant. 
>> He came to america to work for his family. And he got killed. He was an innocent bystander. It wasn't meant for him. It was just a bunch of guys riding around high and drunk just doing stuff that don't even matter at all. And now that night turned into this life. 
>> And the life burks lives in wabash has recently gotten nsiderably more uncomfortable. He has been placed in the custody control unit for assaulting an officer and will likely soon transfer to the even more restrictive secured confinement unit. But burks still has a dream -- 
>> for the people I don't know who the future be, you can google meech. 
>> He plans to someday get out of prison and seek fame and fortune as a rapper known as young meech, da future. ???????????? 
>> if burks had a fan club in the control unit, james greenburg might very well be its president. 
>> Meech, that's my favorite rapper. He's the future. 
>> Hands up like I'm reaching for the heavens, one false move then I'm reaching for my weapon. Just being in the presence of demetrius is a blessing. 
>> As far as anybody in the industry, I don't see anybody on his level. Maybe lil' wayne, drake, kanye west. But not many people can hang with meech. 
>> What's your nickname? 

[00:18:03]


>> White boy. Because I'm mixed and I'm the lightest person from my neighborhood. My dad is black and mexican. My mom is white. 
>> Burkes was friends with greenburg. 
>> I must be a violent offender, as y'all say. You know how people ride with guns on the streets, that's why I have my knife. You never know what's going to happen. I can't say you need one. But it wouldn't hurt to have some on standby. 
>> He is serving 15 years for dealing narcotics and resisting police. But up until his arrest, greenburg found drug dealing afforded him luxuries such as his grill. 
>> I went to the dentist in st. Louis, paid $1,100 and got eight teeth. 
>> Was it worth it? 
>> To me, yeah. 
>> Why did you want to spend that kind of money on your teeth? 
>> I was getting money. So I figured I had to reward myself for getting all this money. 
>> Had he invested that money in brakes for his car, he might have avoided getting caught? 
>> My brakes was messed up on my car and the police seen me riding through a light and I had to skid. It was like that. And police hit their lights. I knew I had a warrant, so i took them on a high-speed. Catch me if you can, I'm the gingerbread man. I ended up getting out of the car and running. I was trying to jump a fence but it was too high for me to clear. So I supermanned it. Some of my pants got caught on it. That's when the dog came up. I said, hey, I ain't going nowhere. Hurry up and get me off this fence, though, because my pants was all stuck on it. He was lucky -- they wouldn't have been able to get me, though. I'd still be out there. 

[00:20:04]


>> Did you have those baggy pants that were like sagging in the crotch? 
>> Well, yeah. Yeah. It was baggy. 
>> Money bags. 
>> What's happening with y'all? 
>> Like his friend burks, greenburg is also an aspiring rapper. 
>> When he says lasagna, I say baloney. 
>> During outdoor recreation which confinement inmates must take in enclosures, they become young meech and white boy. ???????????? 
>> we got to stop it. We got to rewind that one. 
>>> Coming up -- 
>> see that? 
>> After a decade of confinement, christopher trotter tries to fit in. 
>>> And later -- 
>> most of us men never sewed before when he came into this unit. Most of us probably never sewed a button before. 
>> One inmate's patchwork road to redemption. I like to eat a lot of fruits. Love them all. The seal I get with the super poligrip free keeps the seeds from getting up underneath. Even well-fitting dentures let in food particles. Super poligrip is zinc free. With just a few dabs, it's clinically proven to seal out more food particles so you're more comfortable and confident while you eat. A lot of things going on in my life and the last thing I want to be thinking about is my dentures. 
[ Charlie ] TRY ZINC FREE SUPER POLIGRIP. 

[00:24:31]


>>> Y'all see them? I'm done. See that? Yeah. 
>> That some pretty boy guns? 
>> Come on, man. 
>> Sharing a meal with others is something christopher trotter hasn't experienced in about a decade. One of indiana's most infamous inmates and known for violent behavior, he's now back in general population at the wabash valley correctional facility after ten years in solitary confinement. 
>> How long is ten years? I don't think I could have did it. That's a long time. 
>> And to still that the mind that he has, he's really strong, headstrong. 
>> Most people probably done went crazy back there. Wouldn't know how to handle it. 
>> He did what he had to do. He came of it a better man, stronger, I think. 
>> Anytime you go through adversity, it either makes breaks you. You learn from the suations that you go through. I believe that we all are going to be better men in here if we just take the chance to, hey, don't make the same mistakes that we made the first time. 
>> Back in his cell, trotter writes poetry to something else he missed out on. 
>> After ten years of isolation, I'm meeting you for the first time. 
>> The night sky, his confinement cell had no window. 
>> And your beauty is blissful. You never say a word and I find the silence peaceful. Just being in your presence is a joy to my heart. People take things for granted, you know? And this is a window. I would never think a window would make a big difference, but it does, a window. Like I said, I call a lady night. And she mooned me the other night. The first time seeing the moon in ten years. I was like, wait, that was cool seeing her backside. And then she smiled at me and i was like -- it was a a twinkle in her eyes and I seen the stars. I was like, whoa, you know? Just peaceful. Just peaceful. 

[00:27:11]


>> The simple pleasures trotter has gained are about to be taken away from demetrius burks. 
>> Just another day in paradise right here. 204 ccu, a.K.A., Hell. 
>> Burks is currently in the ccu, the custody control unit. But prison officials have decided to give him 15 months in the secured confinement unit for attacking a corrections officer. He will live in the same type of sell trotter did for the last ten years. 
>> I've learned not to touch the police because they will touch you back. 
>> The transfer could come any day. But burks might have even bigger problems. 
>> The case will also go to the prosecutor for their consideration of charges to be filed on the outside against burks. 
>> If the prosecutor pursues the case and burks is found guilty, he could get another six years added to his current 55-year sentence for murder. 
>> It is what it is. Just messed up. But it's prison life. 
>>> Coming up -- 
>> I try myself to sleep a lot just thinking about it because he's still my baby. 
>> Demetrius burks gets a welcome visit from home and another visit that could change his life for the worse. 
>>> And later -- christopher trotter undergoes a different kind of change. 
>> So you want me to cut all your hair off? decisions. Like gas station sushi. Or super cheap car insurance. And then there are good decisions. Like esurance. Their coverage counselor helps you choose the right coverage for you at a great price. 

[00:29:19]


[ stomach growls ] Esurance. Now backed by allstate. Click or call. time drop? Campbell's has 24 new soups that will make it drop over, and over again. ?????? ?????? from jammin' jerk chicken, to creamy gouda bisque. See what's new from campbell's. It's amazing what soup can do. 

[00:32:31]


>>> Whether smuggled in or fabricated from everyday items, inmate-made weapons are a constant concern to officers at indiana's wabaalley correctional facility. With so much effort focused on keeping weapons out of the prison, it might come as a surprise that in one housing unit, scissors are given to inmates nearly every day. 
>> How are you doing? 
>> May I get a pair of scissors? 
>> Certainly can. How's the sewing project going? 
>> Pretty good. Got it about halfway done. 
>> That's good. That's what we want to hear. 
>> Thank you, sir. 
>> Keep up the good work, you hear? 
>> All right. One of the main things we do in our unit, which is kind of unique, is we have taken up quilting. Most of us men never sewed before when we came into this unit. Most of us never sewed a button before. I never had a thought sometime in the future I would like to be sewing somewhere, no, I didn't. 
>> Mitch swallows lives in a special housing unit where inmates overcome their criminal pasts through classes that focus on morals and life skills. 
>> We have many that have come into our program. I found that sewing was a great way to relieve tension, to gain understanding and respect. So it's helped a lot of people. 
>> It lets you be so creative. It is just really a cool thing. This is what I call one of the starburst quilts. Next step is I'll put a straight line on here and square it up. Then we'll put the borders on it and the back and the batting. And we've got a quilt. 
>> Swallows was an unlikely candidate for quilting. When he landed in prison 27 years earlier -- 
>> I was convicted of two attempted murders, four criminal confinements, a rape and criminal deviant conduct. I ended up with a 100-year sentence. I never really got involved in community service projects or stuff like that. It just starts transforming the way you act, the way you think. I think it's opened my eyes a lot to compassion, more to helping those around me. 

[00:34:44]


>> All quilts made by the inmates are donated to various organizations in the community. 
>> This is our main project. And this is for the homeless, for battered women's shelters, for flood victims. A couple of years ago, we had a major flood in this area. We sent quilts there. This is our quilt that we normally do. 
>> Other quilts are donated to a special group of indiana families. 
>> Along with our main focus is also our military project. Every serviceman or woman who has lost their life serving in iraq or afghanistan, we have done a personalized quilt for and the army national guard has come and picked those quilts up and they deliver them to the families. It makes you feel like you're a part of something greater than yourself. I think I've switched from being "it's all about mitch" to realizing that there's a lot more out there and I left a lot of damage in my wake that I need to fix. I've been working trying to do that. 
>> Mr. Swallows, outstanding. That's all I can say about him. He's been down a long time. No anger, nothing, just doing what he's supposed to be doing. 
>> There you go. 
>> Thank you, mitch. Have a good night. 
>> Appreciate it. 
>> See you first thing in the morning. 
>> All right. 
>> As you can see, they're really children's scissors. But we do thousands of quilts with them. Last year, we did over 1,000 quilts. The year before, 916. We made some great quilts. To the gentlemen's credit, they do it with these. It's unbelievable. 
>> Still at the end of the day, even children's scissors are safely secured. 
>> All scissors clear. I put them right here. They're going upstairs. They have to be in the control pod before we change shifts. 

[00:36:45]


>> The prison is not taking any risks with demetrius burks either. He will soon be transferred to the secured confinement unit to start a 15-month stay for assaulting a corrections officer. He has lost virtually every privilege he had. But he is allowed monthly visits. 
>> I'm fixing to go see my mamma. I don't know y'all. I ain't even going to lie. 
>> His mother, maria burks, and stepfather, tony conner, have come to see him today. 
>> Good morning. Visits are extremely important to me and to him because he needs to know that someone is there for him. Everybody can't make it up here. But I send messages and lots of love. Nobody's forgetting about him. He has family and we love him. 
>> Although the visitors center is a short walk away, security is stepped up for confinement inmates. Burks is shackled, escorted by two officers and driven to visitation. The visit will be noncontact, meaning he'll be separated from his family by a pane of glass. 
>> I get to see my baby, I don't even care. I'm a mamma's boy. It don't even matter. At the same time, it would be better. Unfortunately it's got to be through the glass, though. It is what it is. 
>> I need to see him. I need to make sure that he's okay. When I come to see him, I make him stand up, turn around, let me see your body, let me check your out, make sure you're eating well. He's going to say, mom, I'm okay, don't worry. But mom's going to worry anyway. I need to see for myself. I have to come here so I can see him to make sure he's okay. I cry myself to sleep a lot just thinking about it because he's still my baby. Hey, baby. 
>> How you doing? What's up, man? What's up with y'all? 
>> How are y doing? 
>> I'm fin 
>> okay. 

[00:38:45]


>> White boy specifically said tell mamma meech I said what's up. 
>> What's up, g? How are you feeling? 
>> Chilling, man, chilling. 
>> You looking good. Look fit and strong. 
>> Stand up. Let me look at you. Stand up, turn around. Let me see. You all right? Okay. 
>> Burks has not seen his mother since he assaulted officer manuel. But he told her about the incident over the phone. 
>> When will you be able to sign up for school again? 
>> Probably after all this is said and done and whatnot. 
>> After this is settled? Okay. You know we want you to get back in your classes and make sure you concentrate on that. 
>> You just have to keep your head on. Keep your head on. You'll be all right. 
>> Yeah. 
>> I want him to stay positive, stay focused, go to school, learn all you can, get all the education you can get so you can get out of here and be a different man because he's a good person, he's a very good person. Baby, we've got to get out of here. 
>> Mamma, don't try. 
>> Shut up. 
>> You know how your mamma is. She's got to cry. 
>> Okay. We're going to go. 
>> I love y'all. 
>> I love you. 
>> Remember what I said, son, take care of yourself, okay. 
>> All right. 
>> Tell me what the hardest part of it is. 
>> What we just saw. 
>> You all right, baby? 
>> Walking away, seeing her leave because my mom is emotional. So my mom cries at the drop of a hat. I just hate seeing her cry. It's a blessing because there's a lot of guys where people don't come see them at all. I'm blessed to have such a loving and caring family. It's always good to see anybody outside of these walls really. 
>>> Coming up -- 
>> she had all kinds of picture that is I've done for her. Jesus pictures, all kinds of religious pictures I like to do. 

[00:40:47]


>> One inmate doesn't let burning down a church get in the way of his christian-themed art. And childhood memories prove not enough to keep demetrius burks out of serious trouble. 
>> The neighborhood I'm from is right on the same street as the prison. I don't understand why it couldn't have been like a sign like "don't go here." Bright students are getting lost in the shuffle. And administra work gets more complex every year. When you look at these issues, do you see problems or opportunities? With an advanced degree in education from Capella University, You'll have the knowledge to meet these challenges and make a difference in the lives of students. Let's get started at capella.edu. ?????? so, I'm working on a cistern intake valve, and the guy hands me a locknut wrench. No way! I'm like, what is this, a drainpipe slipknot?

[00:44:28]


>>> At a wabash valley correctional facility in indiana, inmates often find comfort in the simplest of pleasures. Bill abbott finds it in caffeine. 
>> Taster's choice. I'm a coffee drinker. As long as I have five or six shots of coffee a day, I'm usually pretty good. That's my choice of drug. I don't know what I'd do if i didn't have coffee. That's what gets me to drawing. This is pretty much what I do all day long. I draw a lot on cards and sell them, draw anything that maybe somebody specifically might want, a portrait of somebody in their family, they buy all the material and I do it. I get paid that way. I had to put my name on the wall. Looks a little bit more presentable. 
>> Abbott also uses his art to connect with his mother. 
>> Makes her day when I send her like a "thinking of you" card. She has all kinds of pictures that I've done for her, jesus pictures, pictures of jesus, all kinds of religious pictures i like to do. 
>> She's religious? 
>> Yeah, christian. 
>> As though his devil horn tattoos aren't ironic enough for a christian-themed artist, abbott is also serving 40 years foealing from and burning down a historic catholic church in his homet and while he claims he didn't do it, he does admit that he stole some shoes from the church before the fire started. 
>> There's definitely something mentally wrong with me when it comes to klepto, taking little things, probably wouldn't think much about it. Some people wouldn't understand why certain people take certain items, I guess. I wouldn't be able to explain it. The psychology part wouldn't add up with me. 
>> But even in prison, abbott still has a certain appreciation for shoes. 
>> I shine my shoes usually for appearance to make myself look for presentable. It's not that nice to walk around scruffy-looking. I'm done with that one. Usually I do this right before they open the door at lunchtime to go to chow. I usually put a little bit of heat on them, just heat the ends of them up real good. The hotter you get the leather, the better the shine because whenever you put the wax on, it just soaks it right into that leather and puts the finishing touch right on it. If we do this on an everyday basis, you'll get them to look like that. 

[00:47:05]


>> Christopher trotter has decided it's time to spiff up his physical appearance asell. But he's not focused on his shoes. He began growing his dreadlocks shortly before he entered solitary confinement ten years earlier. 
>> These are my jesus locks, you know? And they symbolize my struggle being buried alive on the shu. 
>> He's decided to say good-bye to them. 
>> You want me to cut all your hair off? 
>> Yeah. 
>> Bald like mine? 
>> Huh? 
>> You want it bald like mine? 
>> Yeah, yeah -- 
>> just a little bit longer? 
>> Yeah. See how it works out. It's going to be hard. But they've served their purpose. It sustained me and now it's time to move on. 
>> I'm going to start. 
>> Remember what I told you. It's kind of cruddy, right? 
>> As long as it don't have any creepy, crawly things. 
>> Ain't no telling what's in it. 
>> You've been letting your hair grow for 11 years? 
>> Yeah, being back there on that shu. I always told myself, whatever came first, if I get off the shu or I get out of prison, whichever comes first. 
>> That is serious stuff. First time you've seen it like that, huh? 
>> Yeah. It feels good. It feels good without it. It feels good. My life's represented a struggle. It wasn't just to have locks because everybody's got locks, you know? I don't have no mixed emotions. I'm looking forward to the next chapter in my life. 
>> Okay. How do you like that? 

[00:49:06]


>> Looks like I'm about 15 now. It is weird because I ain't seen myself in a long time because this is how I used to look before I had my -- before I grew my dreads. It's been a great day. It's been a great day. Every day is a good day for me now, though. Every day is a good day for me now. No that I'm out of that shu, now that I'm out of that shu, every day is a good day for me now. And I'm not taking it for granted. 
>> While trotter recently completed a decade in the stark solitary existence that comes with life in the secured confinement unit, demetrius burks has only begun his 15-month stay there. 
>> Another day, another dollar. 
>> It is the consequence he will pay for assaulting a corrections officer. But it was the murder of an innocent man that brought him to prison. 
>> When you're out there living that life, you're really not thinking about the consequences until they occur. 
>> But burks had a regular reminder of the consequences of crime. He grew up in the shadow of indiana state prison, home of the state's death row. 
>> The neighborhood I'm from is right on the same street as the prison. It's like I always seen it. I don't understand why it couldn't have been like a sign like "don't go here." You know what I mean? 
>>> Coming up -- 
>> it brought me to tears. My heaept with pride as i opened each fold of that quilt. 
>> The mother of a slain soldier expresses gratitude. 
>>> And -- 
>> demetrius? 
>> Yes, sir. 
>> I'm tom hanks. I'm a detective with the indiana state police. 
>> Demetrius burks gets more bad news. Right in the old bucket. Good toss! See that's much better! That was good. You had your shoulder pointed, you kept your eyes on your target. Let's do it again -- watch me. Just like that one...

>>> 27 years ago when mitch swallows first walked into prison to begin serving 100 years for attempted murder and rape, there were many things they couldn't foresee. Chief among those was that he would learn to quilt. And that quilting would change his life. 
>> I believe that I've changed to the good, I think it has shown within the level of trust that I have amongst the staff. It's a terrible thing that i done. It's something that I've worked on hard in order to know I'm not going to repeat. It's something I've got to live with and feel regret for. 
>> But now his quilts bring comfort to others and swallows learned just how much comfort when the mother of a young indiana soldier who died in the iraq war wrote him a letter. 
>> It says, dear man of the wabash valley correctional program, a very honor to receive the quilt you made in honor of our son. I want you to know that I was having a very sad day the day i received your lovely quilt. I felt as if the world was moving on and people would soon forget the bravery and sacrifice MY SON MADE ON MAY 14th. I was sure they would forget the kid with the big smile, the soldier who bravely stood his watch, the son who I was so proud of. Then your quilt arrived. It brought me to tears. My heart wept with pride as i opened each fold of that quilt. I want you to know you made this mamma look up that day and thank god for wonderful people such as yourselves. A lot of us are here because we messed up our freedoms and for people are over there fighting for those. And to support them in this right here, it's awesome to be a part of something like that. 
>> It's too early to tell if demetrius burks will have such a revelation. But six years into a 55-year sentence for murder, burks has a history of testing authority. 
>> Burks has a lengthy conduct history for drugs, threatening, intimidation, tobacco. 

[00:56:17]


>> But he went too far when he assaulted officer james manuel. 
>> Before I could get security, he turned around and punched me. 
>> I hit him in his face. 
>> He hit me a couple of more times with the handcuffs since he had one loose hanging on the other arm. 
>> I was thinking in my mind, i just messed up. 
>> The assault landed burks in confinement fo15 months. But the fallout continues. Today, investigator frank littlejohn and detective tom hanks of the indiana state police department are about to pay him a visit. 
>> I'm here to serve a warrant for class "d" felony battery resulting in bodily injury on an offender down here. 
>> If burks is found guilty of these new charges, he could have another three to six years added to his sentence. 
>> Sometimes for whatever reason because of how many years they're doing, they think the prosecutor won't pick it up. We've made arrangements and we have burks out waiting for us and mr. Hanks can read him the warrant. 
>> He'll get a copy. Then I have my copy here and i will read him the warrant verbatim. Then he's released back to the custody of the facility. Demetrius? 
>> Yes, sir. 
>> I'm tom hanks. I'm a detective with the indiana state police. This is your copy. I'm going to give to it this officer. I'm going to read this to you. Arrest warrant, the state of indiana, authorized the warrant on demetrius burks, no social security number listed. Count one, battery, resulting in bodily injury, class "d" felony. If this is set for initial hearing, the warrant does not expire. 

[00:58:22]


>> That's a "d" felony, sir. 
>> It's going to be count one, battery resulting in bodily injury, class "d" felony, correct. Okay? 
>> Yes, sir. 
>> All right. Thank you. 
>> He got an initial hearing i think video conferencing that will be conducted with the courts, it will be done here. He'll probably request a public defender and he'll be assigned an attorney to represent him. They'll start negotiations with the prosecutor. See if they can work something out in a plea agreement. If not, it will eventually go to trial. 
>> How do you feel about getting these outside charges? 
>> No comment. I want to speak to my public defender. 
>> He seemed a little surprised. I don't really understand that because with the injuries that he inflicted upon the officer, he should have expected that

>> I recognize I got a family out there that really need me. And spend a lot of time away from me. And say I have always been the best for them. Matter of fact their lives probably would have been a lot better without me in it. 
>> The wabash correctional facility is isolated among miles of corn and soybean fields in indiana. Some of the state's most violent inmates are housed here. And they have been known to hurt each other. James stone has been in prison for the past 25 years for attempted murder. And he has had more than a few scrapes in that time. While some inmates have been known to create knives out of toothbrushes or nearly anything else. Several years ago when stone was at another prison he devised a new like weapon. 
>> The cheese graters was leather work gloves that I had that I took pads off welding gloves, the inside the welding gloves, I took the pad off of them. Put varnish, dipped them in vanish. Pad on top of the varnish, let it dry until it got good and tacky. Drip back down into the varnish. Went to the drill shop where the CURLY Qs ARE, METAL CURLY Qs. Dipped in a bunch of them. Looked like a metal bush on top of the gloves. Then let them dry for a men out. Then I ran them through the top layer of the varnish in the can, keep them from breaking off. And let them dry on your hands while your hands stay balled up. Once they dry, they last forever. Every time you hit some one its like taking cheese through a cheese grater, not pretty. Like making slaw. 
>> Among the population of seasoned inmates like stone are two young sons. Once boyhood friends on the outside they now rely on each other for survival on the inside. 

[00:16:05]


>> We met like a different, places we hang out when we was, what? 13, 14, maybe at the latest. Maybe even 12. 
>> Robbie macinelli is serving six years for armed robbery. And is no stranger to prison. 
>> I will be 23 in a c dates. With parole violations, altogether I have came to prison five times. Ain't none of it been for a long time. But if I keep coming eventually it is going to be. I don't want that. I really don't have nobody out there. I wish I had some place to go. I wish I could get on my feet and get a job and live life productively. I don't want to keep coming here. This ain'te. For anything happened wrong with bro he is going to help me stay out. 
>> You hear me? You already know. 
>> Unlike his boyhood friend in and out of prison five times, this is bradley napier's first time behind the walls. As juvenile, he was first placed on house arrest. Now serving 15 years for burglary and criminal gang activity. 
>> When I heard my sentence, i s crying. At 18, getting 16 years, you know, it seemed like forever. Seemed like, oh, man. I ain't never getting out, you know? We got a good relationship. We talk to each other crazy. Smack each other around when nobody is looking. 
>> It is always real good afterward. 
>> Though they are from the same hometown, their lives in prison would make it seem like they're from different sides of the tracks. 
>> His tv is a little older model. My tv is one of the flat screens they started selling. It's expensive. But it's just a bigger picture, you know what I mean. Everything in here is ours, you know what I mean? It's not -- whatever is mine is his, whatever his is mine. That's the way we live. You know what I mean? 

[00:18:10]


>> Thanks to support from his family, napier has more money to spend on commissary snacks. So once a week he load up for both himself and his macanalley.

[ Bleep ] -- 
>> why would you just grab that? 
>> All the commissary goes in one box. We both eat out of it. He doesn't have a lot of things going for him that I have. So it is hard for him to stay on the right path. 
>> One thing he does have is an abundance of tattoos. 
>> I got these praying hands for my dad. My mom's name in the heart. Honor thy mother. Honor thy father. I got my south side done. My neighborhood where I am from. Over here is money bags. Naked girls. Everybody likes naked girls and money. That's all clowns up there. And ain't too much meaning behind those.

>> I got $100 bill tattooed on my penis. 
>> Oh. 
>> So what do you tell the girls about that, man? 
>> I mean, that's money to blow. 
>> The image on his body tells part of the stories. It's the pictures he kps tucked in a photo album that tell the rest. 
>> How often do you look at it? 
>> Every night. 
>> He hasn't seen his son in more than two years. He has had a contentious relationship with his son's mother.

[00:20:21]


>> This is what he sent for my birthday. A little thing that came. He colored on and put stickers on. It's my life. My world. 
>> Their relationships to their sons are also marked by a have/have not quality. Unlike macanalley, napier enjoys regular visits with his child. 
>> I wouldn't be able to go through what he is going through. Not seeing my son. 
>> There ain't no reasoning behind 26 months. 
>> That's just how it is. We're in two different places. 
>> While macanalley longs for a visit with his son, marcus murray has been playing father figure and teaching his asatru religious beliefs to william jones jr. Jones is two days away from leaving prison on parole. Murray says he hopes that the religion will help keep him from returning to prison. 
>> So when you are hanging out at the house and you realize you got bills to pay or something like that, and somebody comes over, and they offer you the opportunity for you to make a little bit of easy cash, you know, go rob something, things go bad, things break bad. People get involved. People that weren't supposed to be there come out with shot guns. You get killed. You end up being another justin, another heartbreak I have to deal with. 
>> Right. 
>> I have been through this before. I have had friends of mine that I have taken under my wing. Youngsters. That get out before I do. Any way. And they get out there. They mess up. In fact, I lost a friend, sick years ago, justin got shot by a police officer in indianapolis. I feel lick I failed him. 
>> I promise you will I send you a card for every month you are out there. But if you come back, I will send a blanket party your way. 
>> I'm not coming back, bro. 
>> All right, thank you. 
>> COMING UP -- leonard McQuay gets a job and a chance to prove himself. 

[00:22:21]

>> Most of the gangs are divided along racial lines. But the majority of gang members here belong to white supremacist gangs. The aryan brotherhood and saxon knights. Prison officials suspect a growing religious group known as asatru may be a front. One of the asatru leaders at wabash denies that. 
>> There has never been anything in my study that says, one race is more dominant over another. One culture more dominant than another. Or one religion dominant over another. Asatru believers believe our religion is fine. Your religion is fine. 
>> Guy radcliff, practicing asatru for several years here, says there is one group who is not welcome. 

[00:34:10]


>> If we find out that somebody in the asatru community was a child molester, he would be banned from the community. He cannot participate. It is a bylaw. You cannot be a sex offender. And be an asatru. 
>> Ratcliff who used the group's name defended the fact that some members have swastikas tattooed on their body. 
>> The swastika was around a long time before adolf hitler come along. I don't have nothing against uncle adolf but he took something from my religion was a sun wheel and made it part of hiparty. It goes become to ancient civilizations. They had a swastika in persia way before national socialism came along. 
>> While radcliff defended asatru, his comments disturbed murray who let him know how much when he returned to his cell. 
>> You just made us look like a bunch of [ bleep ]. 
>> I tried to talk about this with you. I swear I did. Sorry, marcus. I [ bleep ], bud. I'm sorry. I apologize. Dammit. Try not to get mad at me, man. 
>> Hard not to, man. You just sank my boat. 
>> Later, we told murray we recorded his exchange with raliff. And asked him to explain it. 
>> I was a little mad at him. I mean, it -- he didn't mean, mean any harm. He just -- you know, ignorant of the conduction of leadership roles, you know, and I think now that he -- has seen, you know, that it upset me and knows that, it is not really how we do business, I think he has changed his point of view. 

[00:36:14]


>> Murray hopes to also change the point of view of prison officials. He will soon have a hearing with administrators. To appeal their ban on group worship services among asatru members and to have it removed from the list of security threat groups. ROBBIE MAcANALLEY FACES A Different challenge. He feels isolated from his young son, but from his boyhood friend who just happens to be his cellmate. 
>> My cellie, a great dude, been knowing him for years. And even before we came to prison. But I got my problems that i ain't seen my son in two years. And [ bleep ] he gets to tripping acting like he knows how I feel. And stressing if he don't see his son in a week. Gets visits every week. Everything possible to get in here he has got it. And I'm in here -- up. 
>> Macanalley, wearing his frustration in prison ink. 
>> That says vengeance. I have had a lot of wrong done to me. I hurt a lot. I seek revenge. A lot of animosity built up when I go out. I am hoping I can let things go for my sake and son's sake. Ain't worth it to come become to prison over. 
>> He points to another tattoo as the source of his frustration. 
>> The mother of my child. I'm kind of mad at her that she has not -- she has with held my son from me. 
>> That could be changing. A recent letter and her submission of a visitation request are indications she is planning to bring his son to see him. 
>> This ain't the first time she says she is going to come visit. Let me be in his life. All of a sudden just falls off again. So I am not really going to get my hopes up. Last time I seen him. He couldn't walk, couldn't talk. Nothing. I can't wit to see him. 
>> He clings to the hope that the visit will take place. His cellmate, brad napier, is enjoying one of his regular visits with his two-year-old son, brad junior, and his son's mother, jessica corn. 

[00:38:22]


>> Say, touchdown! 
>> Touchdown! 
>> Bradley talks about his dad. When we pull up, and he sees that guard tower, he is like, that's daddy's house. Daddy's house. Great, he sees the guard tower and razor wire and thinks of his dad. In another sense that is his dad's house. He is excited to see him. 
>> This type of one-on-one between an inmate and his child is rare in most maximum security prisons where visits typically take place a large common area choked with noise and distractions. But napier's session is in a private play room. Part of the prison's fatherhood program. 
>> The fatherhood program is great, man. Because I get to spend a lot more time with my son. I get to come in this visiting room. In this visiting room. Everything is great. It is one-on-one. Me and him running around here. Playing ball. 
>> The monthly visits are carefully monitored by the program's coordinator, joshua cullens. 
>> They have a responsibility, what we are trying to teach them. Even though they're in prison that doesn't give them a copout not to be a dad. 
>> Oh, my gosh. 
>> You are okay. Buddy, get up. 
>> Come on. 
>> Hit his head. Let me kiss it. Go tell daddy, kiss it. Kiss it. 
>> No. You will be all right. 
>> Say, you are beast mode. I'm beast mode. 
>> You're all right. 
>> Daddy's beast mode. 
>> Glad to see you, mr. Napier. Go ahead and have a seat. 
>> Following each visit, napier goes through an interview. 
>> Let's talk about bradley crying. 
>> I think when he starts crying, I say brady get up. You are fine. He is raised by a whole bunch of women. And little boys raised by a whole bunch of women get babied. I don't want my son to grow up getting babied all the time. I want him to have a little toughness about him. Because the world is tough. You know what I mean. Get up. You got to go on anyway. 

[00:40:22]


>> I understand where you are coming from. I want to give you a suggestion. It is okay for him to cry. It is okay for you to say that he is okay and then address the situation and move on. It kind of seemed that -- some of your patterns came from -- just, okay, quick fix, let's get him on to somethink else so he stops what he is doing. It okay to acknowledge why he is crying, find out why he is crying and move on from that. Do you understand what I'm saying? Appreciate you coming in. 
>> Thank you. 
>> No problem. 
>> I like to hear insight on what people think about how I am as a father. I am going to give it some thought about it. But, I know how to be a father. I have done good with it, you know? 
>> Coming up. 
>> Man. 
>> William jones says good-bye to his monitor and hello to life on the outside. 
>> Don't come back. 
>> leonard McQuay argues for a transfer out of confinement. 
>> Give me a chance. Necessary all I need. 

[00:44:36]


>>> All the people forgot about me, man. Acting lake I am dead. Other people want to write me, man. Shout out to you. I help you stay strong. You don't even know it. You know? 
>> As the predawn darkness hangs over indiana's wabash valley correctional facility, most of the 2,200 convicted felons housed here treat it as one more routine day of incarceration. But not william jones jr. Today, after three years. He is going home. 
>> How do you feel today? 
>> Nervous. I am happy to leave. But it sucks to have to leave people here. 
>> The one inmate he most hates to leave behind is his close friend and spiritual mentor marcus murray who is serving 60 years for murder. 
>> What's up, man? 
>> It's going to be hard, dude. 
>> You're going to miss me. 
>> I'm going to miss you, man. 
>> Be cool, man. 
>> All right. 
>> While jones spends his final moments in prison, just outside the walls, his older brother casey and casey's family arrive to pick him up. 
>> Me and my brother are pretty close. I am just glad I get to pick him up, not have to leave him here. I have been up here like eight different times. And it was hard. 
>> Have a good one. 
>> You too. 
>> Good luck. Stay out of here. 
>> It feels different. I guess there is nothing like walking out of prison. I guess. 
>> All right. 
>> Being in jail is not real cool. I don't like it. 
>> Get in there. 
>> What's your name? 
>> Jones. 

[00:46:37]


>> Here are your clothes. 
>> Thank you. 
>> Did you get your property and we'll escort you out of here. 
>> Releasing one from gate two. 
>> Let's go. 
>> Be right with you, man. 
>> Come on, billy, run to me. 
>> Don't come back. I don't want to see you anymore. 
>> I ain't coming back. 
>> One step at a time, sir. 
>> A little bit of normal. 
>> Let me do the honors. 
>> Man. 
>> Cigarettes in the car. 
>> Can't have them right now. 
>> Take a picture. 
>> Oh, man. Finally. 
>> All right. 
>> Everybody in. 
>> While jones savors his first moments of freedom, back inside wabash, convicted murderer leonard McQuay fights for a different kind of freedom. He has a review hearing with his case manager to determine if he is ready to be released back into general population from administrative segregation. The only world he has known for the past 16 years. 
>> You are going all the way out with it, ain't you? Dog leash and all. 
>> THE PROSPECT of McQuay, the killer of a corrections officer, being released back into general population, naturally has some staff on edge. 
>> offender McQuay, he comes off as a very well-spoken, polite individual. That being said, he does have the conduct history with assault on staff. The murder charge of the staff member from the previous facility. So, even though he does come across as a polite individual, you always have to keep that in mind when you are dealing with him. 

[00:48:54]


>> They so evil. They so barbaric, putting all them chains on that guy like that. 
>> I do not trust him. I treat him with respect. But I do not trust him. 
>> THE LAST time McQuay had a review his case manager beverly gilmore, she approved his request for a job. He hopes he can persuade her he is ready for general population. 
>> HELLO, MR. McQUAY. How are you? 
>> I'm all right, mrs. G. How you be? I got my presentation for my review. 
>> MR. McQUAY, WHAT MAKES YOU A Good candidate for release from administrative segregation into the offender general population? 
>> I have engaged in rehabilitation that has allowed me to take a retrospective look, not only at my past, violent behavior, and my new more humbd progressive behavior. And I believe that I have made some significant strides in my social relationship with staff. 
>> All right, leonard. You talk a mighty fine talk. However, how are we to be assured that you actually have soaked this in and believe it down into the bone marrow? 
>> I am asking you, miss gilmore, and asking the administration here to open your hearts and look at me as a human being who has made some terrible mistakes, who has come back from the grave. I am a new man. And the onlyay that this new man can shine is that you give me the opportunity. Please, give me a chance. That's all I need. I won't let you down. 
>> I will summarize that in the statement. Thank you. 
>> Thank you. 
>> They got reason to be concerned because of prior incidents. You know, associated with me. And the only way that they can see that I am not only a changed man, but ready to do something different with my life, is to let me have an opportunity. I haven't had a chance, and that's what I am hoping for. 

[00:51:07]


>> Coming up, marcus murray defends asatru. 
>> You have a salute like white supremacists do. 
>> No, sir. 
>> And a decision is handed down ON leonard McQuay.Ing. It's hard to turn off and go back to sleep. Intermezzo IS THE FIRST AND ONLY PRESCRIPTION Sleep aid approved for use as needed in the middle of the night when you can't get back to sleep. It's an effective sleep medicine you don't take before bedtime. Take it in bed only when you need it and have at least four hours left for sleep. DO NOT TAKE Intermezzo IF YOU HAVE HAD AN Allergic reaction to drugs containing zolpidem, such as ambien. Allergic reactions such as shortness of breath or swelling of your tongue or throat may occur and may be fatal.

Prego?! But I've bought ragu for years. 
[ Thinking ] WONDER WHAT OTHER QUESTIONABLE Choices I've made? I choose date number 2! Whooo! 
[ sigh of relief ] 
[ Male Announcer ] CHOOSE TASTE. CHOOSE PREGO. decisions. Like gas station sushi. Or super cheap car insurance. And then there are good decisions. Like esurance. Their coverage counselor helps you choose the right coverage for you at a great price. 

[00:53:16]


[ stomach growls ] Esurance. Now backed by allstate. Click or call. 
>> This is my little boy around my birthday. That is the one my baby mama sent me. And the first picture was too. And here is day he was born. 
>> robbie McNally has been in prison a little more than two year. In all that time he hasn't had a single visit with his 3-year-old son. Recent contact with the child's mother had given him hope that a visit might be imminent. But now the child's mother represented in a tattoo on MacINALLEY'S ARM CHANGED HER Plans. 

[00:55:30]


>> She had been talking about for the past 2 1/2 months now, going to bring trey down there. Going to bring trey down there. All of a sudden. This year, too busy. I THINK I WILL TURN HER INTO A Clown. Bro, I will turn her into a clown. 
>> He just talks. He loves that girl -- 
>> she ain't worth [ bleep ], she ain't worth [ bleep ]. 
>> Later he revealed one possible reason why the mother of his child has not followed through on visits. He said it was an incident that happened shortly before he returned to prison. Something he rarely talks about. 
>> It was a domestic battery. I haven't seen him since then which was -- yeah, the last time I seen him was the night that happened. 
>> He can only accept the consequences of his actions and do little to control developments with those left behind on the outside. Today marcus murray is hoping to make the big change on the inside. 
>> How are you doing? 
>> He filed a grievance to have asatru removed from the threat groups or gangs. Today security threat group coordinator, and superintendent have granted murray a hearing on the matter. 
>> If you were in a leadership position and you saw some one coming into your community or into your services with ill-will or intent to participate in security threat group activity what would your take on that be? 
>> I would tell them to go back from whence they came. There is no reason to bring ill will in, it is a sacred place. If one person is sick in the group, then we are all sick. If you are in the community you have a say-so. If it is anything controversial, it does get voted on. 
>> Can you elaborate on that a little bit? 
>> Let's say somebody had a new idea for how we salute each other. 
>> You say salute. You talk about greeting someone? 
>> Like particular handshakes or something. Like, as a fraternity. You know, people look to set themselves apart. 

[00:57:39]


>> You stated that you or your community have a greetinthat you refer to as a salute. Could you show me what that refers to? 
>> No, I never said that. 
>> No. No. 
>> You mean, like we say something, we say "hailsa," which means hello and good health. 
>> You weren't referring to a gesture? 
>> No, no. 
>> Body language or anything lake that? 
>> Like a lot of white supremacists do when they do hitler salute. 
>> No, sir. 
>> I have one major question here, what is your input on other races joining your community? 
>> We will discriminate against no one regardless of race, gender, sex, creed, nationality, origin, or of their religion. We won't discriminate from that. 
>> Have you had a minority in the leadership role? 
>> No. 
>> If that opportunity arose, would that be allowed? 
>> Yes it would. 
>> Mr. Hendricks do you have any more questions? 
>> No, not today. 
>> Marcus do you have any questions for us? 
>> No, I don't. 
>> Thank you very much. 
>> The final decision could still be weeks off. But the wait is over for leonard McQUAY. Prison officials have denied his request to be moved back to general population. 
>> It seems like he has everything in the world going for him. But when you really sit down and you really listen, off the unit when he thinks you can't hear him talking, some of the things he talks about negative toward staff, when a staff person was assaulted by another offender in another cell house, he was applauding. So that is a telltale sign that he is not ready to go into the general population. 
>> I don't want to lose my mind on a unit like this. I don't want to physically begin to deteriorate where I can't get no help. So I am saying, I want to actually be given an opportunity to do something progressive with my life. Back here in solitary confinement, I can't do that.

[00:02:24]


>> Isolated in the rural farming communities of southwestern indiana, the wabash valley correctional facility is 340 acres of concrete, razor wire and broken dreams for the inmates incarcerated in this maximum security indiana prison. They arrive from all over the state. But the superintendent dick brown who runs wabash and started as a corrections officer here 19 years earlier has seen a big change in the population. 
>> Traditionally they were from the inner cities, cities like gary and indianapolis and south bend and now we are seeing more from the rural communities in part to the methamphetamine problem. The ingredients for methamphetamine come from farms. So that's why we have a large amount of offenders being incarcerated from local small communities. They get involved with the meth ring and caught up and end up in the indiana department of correction. 
>> I got to be honest, most of the police knew me by a first-name basis. 
>> It's the same thing over and over. Day in, day out. 
>> Methamphetamine is the worst thing I have ever come in contact with. My only regret, I wish I never, ever in my life seen it for the hundred good stories I could tell you I can tell you three times the bad stories. It made me feel the greatest at times and made me hate myself most of the time. 
>> Chas harper is currently serving his fourth prison term. The first three totalled six years for theft and burglary but when he was caught with 114 grams of meth the judge threw the book at him. 

[00:04:30]


>> I was sentenced to 72 years which means I have to do 36. That is 12 years more than a murder. Most murderers get 60 years. It's hard for my family to grasp that the amount of time for the charges. I mean how do you explain to a six-year-old why your dad can't come home and to an 11-year-old you might be a grown man before you see me again on the outside. 
>> But harper is not without family behind the bars. He shares a cell with his younger half trouble. 
>> We have got in trouble together. If he decided he wanted to do something I would go behind him and be like all right. Let's go, then. 
>> Keep doing this [ bleep ] be a domestic battery case. I swear to god. 
>> I got it. 
>> I will be up for clemency by the time you figure it out. 
>> Carr has been in and out of prison on minor drug charges for ten years. This time he is in for dealing meth. The prosecutors had enough of him as well. 
>> They said they would give me 85 years. They just gave chas 72 years. I signed the plea bargain. 
>> I know you are distraught because "days of our lives" isn't on now. 
>> Even with the plea bargain he got 35 years. Carr says he sold drugs not just to support his addiction but to support his brother. 
>> Chas was arrested and i started paying for his legal fees. I was paying for his attorney with drug money. 

[00:06:34]


>> I feel like it's my fault. I feel like he messed up his life trying to save mine. 
>> Family's first, you know, it's just the way it is. 
>> I know in any situation i ever get into, he's going to be there, whether it's right or wrong, good or bad, he's going to be there. And I mean, he's loyal, loving and a pain in the ass, sometimes but that's him. You can't pick your family. 
>> Skitz. That's the nickname that he gave me probably about ten years ago? 
>> Yeah. Ten or twelve years ago. 
>> Yeah. 
>> How did he get that nickname. You tell me. 
>> We was high on meth, we was setting there and he was tripping out thinking he could see the cops everywhere and he kept saying there's the cops i swear that's the cops. I was like, quit skitzing out. I kept calling him skitz and now everybody in america calls him skitz. 
>> Pretty much. 
>> Coming up harper and carr continue to mark time. 
>>> A cell search uncovers a cry for help. 
>> We just found a suicide note in his drawer. 
>> And the kokomo slayer talks about his triple murder. 
>> I can remember nearly every blood spot in that house.?????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????? ?????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????? 

[00:11:22]


>>> a methamphetamine epidemic has not only ravaged many of the small towns in america's heartland it has changed the face of inmate populations. At prisons like wabash valley correctional facility in indiana. But wabash houses men doing time for more serious crimes. Men like jeremy blanchard. 
>> I have never been a drug abuser or a drunk. I knew what I done when I done it. I knew the heinous nature of what I done. I can still to this day remember nearly every blood spot that was in that house. I can remember the wallpaper, the way the bodies were laid. I can remember nearly everything that happened that night. 
>> Blanchard has served a little more than one year of a 195-year sentence. But his facial tattoos will forever commemorate both his crime, the triple murder and the moniker the media gave him, the kokomo slayer. 
>> That's who I am and what I'm about. Yes. 
>> Blanchard tracked down his former girlfriend, her mother, and her mother's boyfriend when they traveled to kokomo, indiana to attend a funeral. Blanchard broke into their home, hid inside and stabbed all three to death with a butcher's knife. 
>> A friend of jessica's told me that she had an abortion and that's what probed my anger and my hatred. I mean that's my childt was killed. I'm not even a political person. I've never thought about abortions this that manner. But I guess you could say as a man, I felt like I was stabbed in the heart a thousand times. Blanchard first attacked jessica's mother and her boyfriend as they lay in bed. 

[00:13:46]


>> I remember jessica running into the room and I stabbed jessica just to shut her up. Because she was screaming. And I wanted to talk to jessica before I knew I killed her. So I let jessica say good-bye to her mom because her mom was dying. I took jessica back into the kitchen. And I -- I made a tourniquet for jessica's neck because I stabbed her neck. I wanted to know why she done what she done, why she killed my child. And I will say this, she never admitted it. 
>> The next morning jessica's brother arrived and discovered the bodies. He identified blanchard as a suspect and police apprehended him within hours. Blanchard bled guilty as part of a deal to avoid the death penalty. 
>> You don't feel you should have received the death penalty? 
>> I believe that is for god to answer. If god would have wanted that i would have got that. Do I believe that because I took another life I should die? No I don't. 
>> Why isn't it up to god to decide jessica's fate? 
>> Obviously, it was their time. I can't answer that. 
>> Do you still believe that they all deserved to die? 
>> I would honestly answer yes. I believe that they done something to me that I couldn't have lived with. It would have hurt me to the day I died. 
>> While blanchard says drug use played no role in his murder it plays a role in many of the ores. Drugs make their way behind the walls as well despite screens methods they can be smuggled in during visitation and in the mail. 

[00:16:00]


>> We are going to go in and shake down suspected people who have drugs, weapons, anything unauthorized. 
>> Let the dog run through the cell and shake down. 504. 
>> There is possible concentrations of meth in this unit. So we're going to try to find it. 507. 
>> A lot easier to see things when there is not as much clutter. That's why the guys like to keep clutter. It makes our job harder. 
>> While the officers search their cells, the inmates give urine samples. 
>> The result is negative on that. Each line has a number. The drugs down there. The control along the top. Tells us the test is valid. 
>> One inmate refused to comply with the drug test. 604. 
>> Four. 
>> THE INMATE IS martin McDaniel who is serving 16 years for three counts of burglary. 
>> He is going to the ccu which is the custody control unit. They take offenders who are troublemakers who refuse orders and have been in fights what have you. 
>> Officers inspecting the cell make a discovery. 
>> I will call the nurse. This is prescription. 
>> McDANIEL HAS A PRESCRIPTION For anti-depressants. But the pills shouldn't be in his cell. 
>> We found a bunch of drugs he should have taken when they were given to him. He has been saving them. 
>> Moments later a letter is discovered in the cell. It could shed light. 
>> Hi, mom I'm good and safe depends on where I went. I'm sorry for putting you through this be mom my fight is done I could not take it any more. This is a suicide letter. 

[00:18:06]


>> Vera? 
>> What? 
>> The gentleman we just took to ccu we just found a suicide note in her drawer. He is saying bye to his mom and children. Put him on suicide watch. Make sure that gets to evidence. 
>> I got it right here. 
>> Okay. 
>> Coming up. The letter was never meant to be found. 
>> martin McDaniel speaks out and is surprised by the consequences. 
>>> And more from the kokomo slayer. 
>> I seen it like she done something to me. So therefore I'm going to do it's hard to turn off and go back to sleep.

>>> My name is jeremy blanchard. I'm serving 195-year sentence for three counts of murder. This is my personal time to say once again to my family that I'm truly sorry. And it's a -- if I could change the fact I put you through so much turmoil and heart ache, i would. Jeremy blanchard might regret that his parents and young son suffered through the emotional turmoil of losing him to prison. But when it comes to the horrifying triple murder that brought him to wabash and earned him the moniker kokomo slayer he is less regretful. 
>> Would I say that I would not do it again? I honestly cannot tell you that. 
>> Blanchard stabbed his former girlfriend, girlfriend's mother and his girlfriend's mother's boyfriend with a butcher knife. 
>> I seen it like she done something to me so therefore I'm going to do something tenfold to her. I'm a man of principle. I guess you could say. Somebody like me with my mentality does not belong out in society. So, yeah, I believe that i belong in prison. I don't take that away from society. 
>> Blanchard will have a lifetime in prison to think about the devastating effects of his principles. 
>>> But chas harper who is serving 72 years on his latest conviction for dealing methamphetamine has a different set of priorities. He recently discovered a device to help make his leisure time more leisurely. 

[00:33:50]


>> This is a razor and you -- and a guard and you hook it up there. So you are all the way across the cell. Just sit back and turn it like that. 
>> Knowing he might have to serve at least 36 years before being paroled, harper places a high priority on making prison feel like home. It helps that he shares a cell with his half brother david carr who is up for parole in about 16 years. But they celebrate every month that gets them closer to home. 
>> Today is -- we're going to celebrate a month gone by. Me, my brother and two other guys. Kamikaze is a penitentiary mcyver. He's good at cooking his celly is really good at cooking. We have a nacho slam and make a cake. We say it's a celebration. I say it's to realize we wasted another month in here. It's something to look forward to. 
>> Who makes the cake? 
>> My buddy kamikaze makes the cake. 
>> He is no ordinary cook. Among wabash inmates he's a culinary genius, turning snack food into something special. But doing a prior on term he learned to be a difficult sort of cook. 
>> I went around to other people who were in prison for cooking meth and got a recipe from this guy and this guy and figured that was going to be my new thing. Stealing cars wasn't working. The last two times that I got out of prison that was all that I -- my intent was to cook meth. I love to smoke it too. But you know, I like to make it. Making something that people really like and getting the reaction from it, you know, that was another thing that I liked about it. I tried to make the best stuff. 

[00:36:12]


>> Thank you. 
>> For their monthly slam, the four men pool the snacks they purchase from the prison commissary. 
>> This is a survival kit. Chips, shells, sausages, bean, soups. 
>> About a month. 
>> About a week, really. 
>> But things don't always go as planned. 
>> A bag of jolly ranchers out of a $20 order. This is everything I ordered. All they gave me was the jolly ranchers. Everything else exceeds my balance. I'm eating off skitz for the next two weeks. 
>> You all right with that? 
>> [ Bleep ] yeah. 
>> He doesn't have a choice in the matter. 
>> That's what a brother's for. 
>> What's mine is his. 
>> Even with the short fall the men managed to acquire the necessary ingredients for gaskill's chocolate peanut butter fudge cake. 
>> To make the fudge, you take a peanut butter and melt it down and add sugar with it. We have brownies for the crust. We'll roll that out and make it a layered brownie, fudge and once that is done we'll melt down the candy bars and put that on top. It's like rock up a crack rock. 
>> I never did that sir. 
>> Looking good, ain't it, bro? 
>> [ Bleep ] yeah. 
>> Chocolate. You have to spread it out before it hardens up. That's it. Guaranteed if you don't have diabetes after this, you will. 
>> Here's to the month of april. Another month in the books. ! 394 more months and I'm out of here.

>> Quesadillas for may? 
>> I don't know. 
>> Gaskill, harper and carr received their convictions for drug-related offenses. But fabian gomez is serving 40 years for taking a life. 
>> Feel pain because I did horrible things out there. Destroyed lots of families, including my own. I lived the life of a thug. All I did was party and sell drugs. 
>> Gomez's crime took place on new year's eve when he says he was cleaning his gun. 
>> New year's of course you want to shoot your gun for new year's. 
>> Gomez admits cheating on his girlfriend and that night she confronted him on it. 
>> We got in a really bad argument. Not physical, verbal but in the instance of the argument, something happened where the gun went off. 
>> Gomez's girlfriend was hit in the face. 
>> She was -- she fell to the floor. She was bleeding. I called 911 and the police came and they pulled me to the side. You know, everything started happening. Everything started happening like I was in the dream. 
>> His girlfriend was rushed to the hospital. But she wasn't the only one fighting for her life. 
>> She was pregnant. She was going to be a month due when it happened. 
>> Doctors saved the baby, a girl who is being raised by his girlfriend's parents. Gomez's girlfriend died two weeks later. 
>> Do you think you will ever see that child?

>>> this is my main view a lot of times. This is a -- lying on my bunk, look up. It's pretty much what you see. Cell door. Boxes. Sink. Toilet. Mirrors. Headphones. Got me a penitentiary back scratcher. This is existence. You make the best of it. You get comfortable. You do what you got to do. It is what it is. 
>> Making the best of life at the wabash valley correctional facility is something everyone must learn on their own. IT IS HARD FOR martin McDaniel.

[ bleep ] situation. 
>> while McDaniel longs for a visit from his family, patrick gaskill just had a severe restriction placed on his visitation privileges. He was caught with a bag full of inmate-made alcohol in his cell. And now he is restricted to a noncontact basis. 
>> That sucks. That's about worst thing they can do to you here. You know, still get visits but noncontact. But it's not worth having the people drive, you know miles and miles you know just to come see you behind a glass wall. You can't even hug your people. 
>> What did they tell you? 
>> Same old -- pled not guilty. 
>> Gaskill will get 60 days in confinement. He will leave his three closest friends behind.

>> For gomez, the ceremony represents the completion of his g.E.D. 
>> Is this how you put it on? What side did this go on? 
>> I haven't got an education in 12 years. 
>> How does it feel?

=======================================================

>>> Due to mature subject matter, viewer discretion is advised. 
>>> To me, this place is dr. Frankenstein and we are the monsters. 
>> One of the state's most infamous inmates tries to convince the prison officials he's changed. 
>> That sounds like a threat. 
>> No, that's water under the bridge. 
>> Corrections staff investigate a potential escape plot. 
>> You understand why we would have concerns with an offender having an 11-foot rope? 
>> There is nothing for me to do. 
>> We've also given one of our cameras to the inmates to tell their own stories. 
>> Hello, everybody. It's me, the stone. 
>> And one of them turns out to be a very familiar face. 
>> Going to steeny land. 
>> Oh, no. 
>> How in the world are you going to deal with a bunch of punks challengg you? 
>> Sticks and stones will break my bones but words will never hurt me. 
>>> On the western edge of southern indiana is the wabash valley town of carlisle where main street conjures images of a bygone era, and except for the daily passing of the csx freight line, this one-light town might be all but forgotten. Just a couple miles down u.S. 41, however, is evidence that carlisle is anything but forgotten. 
>> It's 2 1/2 hours away from evywhere. Just the middle of nowhere. What goes on out here? Prison. That's what goes on out here. 

[00:02:09]


>> Surrounded by little else but big skies, the wabash valley correctional facility houses more than 2,000 convicted felons, including some of the highest security prisoners in the state. It is a fortress among farms. 
>> We have a total of seven towers blanketing the entire facility, including one tower that's ithe center of our south yard. We've got the two sets of fences all the way around the facility. The inner fence is a stun fence, it's a nonlethal stun fence. The outside fence another 14-foot fence covered with razor ribbon. Shaker alarm on the motion detector. Motion detector in between the fences. We think our perimeter is very, very secure for us. 
>> Security is tight inside the perimeter as well. Especially in the secured confinement unit which houses the prison's most violent and disruptive inmates. Today internal affairs investigator frank littlejohn has been called to the unit to investigate a report that possible escape paraphernalia has been found inside a cell. 
>> Last night an officer had looked inside of a cell and observed a sculpture object like a, we refer to them like a dummy-like object on a comment report. Which is escape paraphernalia. So they conducted a shakedown of this guy's cell and during that cell search they also found an 11-foot rope. When you put the 11-foot rope with the sculpture of the face then that gives concerns that the guy might be planning a possible escape. 
>> This here is actually the head that was removed from the cell. And this here is the rope. And it looks like an intertwined sheet that was braided together. It is about 11 feet long that was also removed from the cell. If he was to get outside of a cell and have this covered up and a body-like object in the cell, the staff might walk by, especially if the lighting is bad in the cell and at first glass looking through the cell door and you see this, that it could possibly be somebody laying there when actually it's this. 

[00:04:18]


>> The inmate in whose cell the items were found is a nigerian lukuman aderibigbe. He's serving 38 years for the armed robbery and battery of two other nigerian immigrants and his record inside prison is troubling. 
>> He has a violent history. That's why he's in this unit. Assaults on staff, possession of weapons. He poses a serious risk to the facility. 
>> Sit right here. What was found in your cell last night? 
>> It was some sculpture I was making of my son. And I was skipping rope. I was using it as a jump rope. A skipping rope, you know, for my high blood pressure. 
>> What was the rope made from? 
>> I don't know. I guess from the clothes. You know what I'm saying? I use that as a skipping rope. 
>> Did you make the rope? 
>> No, I didn't make the rope. 
>> How long ago was that? 
>> When they moved someone out of there. 
>> You had the rope for two months? 
>> No, I said like -- 
>> you had the rope two months. 
>> He says he got the rope off the range a couple months ago. Which is kind of hard to believe. The head isn't as big of a concern. The rope is what is concerning. He said it was for exercises but I'm not buying that at this point. Do you understand why we are concerns with an offender having an 11-foot rope 73 >> I don't know what the concern is but it has nothing to do with me. 
>> Did you know you are not allowed to have ropes? 
>> Look, man, where am I going? 
>> Well, with an 11-foot rope, you can climb with it. 
>> I'm in a secure dorm. 
>> I have been in here several years and I have had offenders climb with a rope in the secure unit. For one he's got an assaultive history on staff. It could be used to hang somebody or choke somebody. It could be used to escape. To climb a fence. I mean there's multiple things that this could be done with that would not be a good thing for us. 

[00:06:18]


>> He is placed in a separate holding cell while a team of corrections officers assemble to search his cell again, even more closely than the last time. 
>>> We've got ball peen hammers to tap on the blocks to make sure nobody is trying toet through their cell wall. 
>> Start on this side and I'll start on this side. Just two around the room. 
>> We are just making sure checking the bricks. Making sure they're not trying to chip around the bricks, break them out. Make sure we don't have soft spots. 
>> When we do shakedowns like this we look through all their books, all their paperwork, see if we can't find any snitch notes, kites, anything like that. Definitely we get a lot of our information. 
>> Sometimes they like to hide them in the bible. They will stick them in the middle usually right in here. 
>> Officials find no other escape paraphernalia in the cell. 
>> Right now he is pinning a class "b" conduct report for possession of escape paraphernalia for what was found in his cell last night. 
>> Without knowing his intentions you don't know if it's an arts an crafts issue or in two weeks from now could we be looking for him on the streets and this laying in his bed. 
>> Coming up -- 
>> if you make the wrong choice, it has consequences. 
>> One of the most infamous inmates in indiana tries to start I new life at wabash. And later -- the investigation takes a surprising turn. 
>> You can't never take anything that appears innocent at face value.@?? 

[00:11:04]


>>> most oe inmates at indiana's wabash valley correctional facility measure their sentences not in years but in decades. It is a lot of time to think about the past. So prison officials allowed us to give some inmates personal cameras to record some of those thoughts in the privacy of their cells. 
>> Don't worry about people think you're a coward. Best to walk away and have another day, than to stand strong and end up wrong. Words never hurt you. What people think never hurts you. Losing your freedom, losing your life, losing your family, that's what hurts you. 
>> James stone has been incarcerated for the past 26 years and still has a long haul ahead of him. 
>> I got another 50 years to do. And I think it's more or less an overkill. I mean 26 years, it don't matter if you done the crime or didn't do the crime. Guilty or not guilty. None of that matters anymore. 26 years. That's enough time for anyone. I've done did more time than guys are doing for murder, unless they're on death row. And there's no murder involved in my case. Attempted murder I mean, come on, really. I don't let it get me down. I try not. Sometimes I do lose my cool and I'll snap off at someone but then I'm cool. 
>> We first met stone three years earlier during our extended stay shoot at indiana state prison. 
>> It's a glamour job but somebody's got to do it. 
>> When stone first came to prison he was an admitted thug, who fought frequently. 
>> Where you going, big buddy? 
>> But the james stone we met considered himself a changed man, thanks to indiana state prison's cat adoption program. 

[00:13:10]


>> He's my little buddy. I depend on im. He's more dependable than anything I got in here. I mean, he takes a lot of the anger and temper away. Makes it easier to cope in here. 
>> Stone has been at wabash for a year and a half ago now. 
>> I talk to guys that come in here from all the other prisons that recognize me say hey, you're the cat man, aren't you? I'm like, dude, really? Best thing I can do is say I'm him, meow, see you later. 
>> The transfer occurred after a staff member reported stone had threatened him. Stone denies the allegation but a much bigger concern was leaving his cat jinkster behind. 
>> They don't allow cats down here so I couldn't bring him with me. And that was a big -- a big heartbreak separation there, you know. Because I he little -- the little sucker. 
>> Just before his transfer stone gave(jinkster to another inmate. 
>> It brought a tear to my eye. 
>> I did like an indian commercial. I didn't want to let go of my little buddy. 
>> But at wabash stone has found another animal to take under his wing. 
>> I got a little bunny buddy out back. I'll watch him sometimes through the window here or when I go to work I'll make sure I throw him a couple apples to keep him fed. He has been here the whole year and a half. I open the window. He'll be sitting right there by the fence all the time. He's like clockwork. I don't know what he likes about that little area, unless it's me feeding him all the time. Apples, cookies, coffee cake. He's a more sophisticated rabbit. You know what I'm saying? Won't be long I'll have him on some watermelon hooch. 
>> Like stone inmate christopher trotter has been behind bars SINCE THE MID 1980s. 
>> I came into prison to serve a four-year prison sentence for petty theft. I came in with four years and ended up with 142 year that's what could happen in prison if you make the wrong choice. It has consequences. 

[00:15:26]


>> The wrong choice trotter refers to was being one of the instigators of a 1985 riot at another indiana prison. Seven corrections officers were stabbed. Two others and a counselor were held hostage for 15 hours. 
>> It was a pretty massive riot that they had at that time and chris trotter was one of the main players in that. And since then, trotter has done his share to maintain his image of that. 
>> Trotter has maintained that he was defending another inmate from abusive staff. 
>> Some of them were stabbed but some of them were beat up. Some of them went to the court and overexrated their wounds. 
>> The judge in trotter's case saw nothing to laugh about. 
>> I was found guilty of one count of attempted murder, one battery, four counts of criminal defilement and one count of rioting. And I was sentenced to 142 years. P and was like, wow. Most violence is spontaneous. That's what that was. It was spontaneous. One incident led to something else led to something else led to something else but it is never the solution. 
>> Trotter has now been in prison for 26 years 73 due to his role in the riot and other disciplinary problems, he has spent 16 of those years in the securitied confinement unit. 
>> Due to his behaviors in the past, trafficking, extortions, intimidations we consider him to be a risk to our safety. Therefore he was placed on administrative segregation. 
>> Trotter has spent many years in confinement reading and writing. He has found particular meaning in mary shelley's "frankenstein." 
>> As a child I always watched the movie "frankenstein" so i recently read the novel. I was like, hey, I started to look at the monster kind of differently. I was like, who is really the monster? To me this place is dr. Frankenstein and we are the monsters. And I call this the belly of the beast. We're the outcast. We're the forgotten. 

[00:17:31]


>> All right. 
>> In my spare time I likeo write, and I've been contemplating on writing a book. I ted off like this. Frankenstein, the moment you created me, you condemned me, rejected me, crucified and despised me. Abandoned me emotionally, unleashed the very hell in me, often overlooked stepped upon crushed, no one stops to notice that my movements are poetic. My stride is determined. My love is unconditional. My spirit is free. Although I'm a monster, there is a soul inside of me. 
>> I do not believe there is an employee in the indiana department of correction in any state facility that does not know the name christopher trotter. 
>> Beverly gilmore is the confinemunit's case manager. One of her responsibilities is to evaluate trotter's ability to return peacefully to general population. 
>> I know the notoriety of offender trotter very notorious. I believe he has aged out of that immaturity. He has developed good communication skills, good social skills. It's yes, ma'am, no, ma'am to me. And it's not fake. I can always tell when it's fake. I believe, personally, that he will be ready for general population before long. However, there are so many more people above me that will also have the input, and have known him so much longer than I have. So I'll have to respect whatever their recommendations will be. 
>> I'd rather not see him come out. I don't think he's changed. He's going to hurt somebody. 
>> LIEUTENANT gary McMillan has been at wabash for the past 16 years. 

[00:19:38]


>> This is my opinion. He's a pretty violent individual. 
>> They may look at it like everybody's still a potential threat. But am I a threat? No. 
>> Coming up -- 
>> really my biggest concern about being inside is just getting in trouble. 
>> Fresh from wabash's youth unit an 18-year-old inmate spends his first day in the big house. 
>> I used to be a very violent person. I hope no one tries testing me. easy, up in the middle of the night it can be frustrating. It's hard to turn off and go back to sleep.

[00:22:55]


>>> there's no hard labor here. And makes it sort of hard to keeping yourself in shape. You see a lot of guys that's been here after two or three or more years and they get that couch potato look on them, you know, hang gut and all that there sagging everywhere. Me? I like to try to keep myself in shape. 
>> At indiana's maximum security wabash valley correctional facility most inmates work out either on the outside recreation yard or inside on weight machines. But not james stone. 
>> I got 16 workouts I do in here. Using the bag and the box. 
>> After 26 years in prison, stone has developed a workout routine he can do inside his cell. 
>> Water bottles. All water bottles. Getting it closed is the problem. One set of everything every day until I burn out. I don't do a certain amount. I do them till I can't do them no more. And I record how many I do of each thing each day. Then the next day my goal is to do one more better than what i did the day before. You can't get it out there at rec. There's too many people out there in that little closed area and the weights out there ain't real weights. I like something lifting where you concentrate on the weight, work your body. Not work out with training wheels. Put it back. After you get to a number that's just unbelievable, then you start walking around wearing a cape because you're like superman which I ain't reached that level yet. I'm still in the bat cave. You know what I mean? 
>> Stone, who was convicted of attempted murder, won't be eligible for parole for another 25 years. He could spend the rest of his life in prison but he says his workout is designed to prepare him, just in case he's released. 

[00:25:07]


>> Rotate around like I'm working on a loading dock or something. Call it a workers' workout. That way if I do get out, job ain't going to kill me. I'm all ready for it. Plus when you get to be my age, you got to stay in shape. That way, when the guys half my age want to mess with the old man, it ain't my fault. 
>> There is always a new guy or two arriving on stone's unit every week. For some it's just a short walk from a special unit at wabash for minors who have been convicted as adults. The adult maximum security prison. Miles folsom has been in the youth unit for the past two years. But today is his 18th birthday. And his first day in the big house. He is serving 36 years for armed robbery, criminal confinement and burglary. 
>> It's a little nerve-racking. You don't know anybody. It's a lot of bigger of a side you know. Most of the people in here are my father's age, you know. I never thought in my wildest dreams I would ever come to prison. Never thought about prison. Really it sounds kind of stupid from my standpoint. Because looking back on the things that I was doing, if i would have thought about it, there was no way that I couldn't have not ended up in prison. I have been in trouble since i was nine. You know, repeatedly. Acts of violence, vandalism, things like theft, you know. So the police know me, you know, and they were sick and tired of me. So they took everything that they could and slapped it on me. 
>> Folsom was 15 when he was tried as an adult for his latest safety convictions, which made headlines in his smalltown newspaper. 
>> This is my newspaper article. The heading says reign of terror comes to end. Fourth circuit court judge mary harper sentenced folsom to 36 years behind bars and denied his request to be placed in a therapeutic community program. You're a very dangerous young man, harper said. 

[00:27:11]


>> Folsom's charges revolve around the brutal beating of an acquaintance he believed had stolen his ipod. 
>> We ended up getting into his truck before we started arguing because it was cold. And I started banging his head off the window repeadly. I was real high on owe cane. Really it was like a fog 73 and I got really angry and I get i did some pretty good damage banging his head off the window. The judge, she was pretty strict, giving me them 36 years. And I hope that it was just her trying to slap me in the face to tell me to wake up, because truthfully, I was lost. 
>> Folsom completed his g.E.D. At wabash's youth unit. He plans to pursue a college degree from prison and hopes to earn time off his sentence by holding down a job. 
>> Really my biggest concern about being on thide is just being in trouble. I hope that no one tries testing me, you know. Because I used to be a very violent person. I'm not that person no more. I'll never want to revert to that. 
>> With good behavior, folsom may only have to serve 18 of his 36-year sentence. Making his 18th birthday an even more significant milestone. 
>> A can of pop. A special occasion. You know. Sometimes it's hard to keep hope. Sometimes it's easy to fall into negativity especially in the juvele block when there are so many kids that just don't care. It took getting 36 years to wake me up to realize that's not what I want to do that it's not a game no more. 
>>> Coming up -- 
>> just hit a man while you're down. 
>> James stone is challenged by the new kid on the block. 
>>> And an unexpected twist in the escape investigation. 

[00:32:46]


>>> At indiana's wabash valley correctional facility the men considered to be the most dangerous and disruptive are housed in the secured confinement unit. Most inmates have assaulted staff or other offenders and are in windowless single man cells 23 hours a day. They take their meals alone and phone calls made once a week are made from the isolation of their cells. 
>> In this confinement unit we have to deliver all of their services. I try to make contact with every one of my offenders at least once a week. That's all 144 of them. 
>> Case manager beverly gillmore is the primary link to the rest of the world for the inmates. 
>> I came from the south. I was so protected and so green when I came here. And when I started learning more about the needs of offender population I thought why can't i be an advocate for them? On a daily basis they will send letters to me or notes requesting information, maybe complaining, or some of them just telling me have a nice day miss gilmore. And that's nice. Because it's better than getting cussed out. 
>> One of gilmore's inmates is lukuman aderibigbe. 
>> I'll say, hey, lukuman, are you okay, mon? And I'll go, oh, miss gilmore, you okay, mon? I enjoy that time with him. When I can understand him. He gets to talking fast and i say, slow it down, buddy. 
>> But despite gil more's best efforts, aderibigbe has been challenge for corrections staff. 
>> His acting out has just been extreme. Such as maybe he didn't get an apple in his lunch, or an officer or anybody will be glad to go get the apple and take it to him but he would react to that by banging d banging and throwing things to the point where the response team would have to go in and take him to the ground. He's a strong little dude, too. 

[00:35:08]


>> He'll throw stuff. He'll smear poop, feces. He's done a little bit of everything. 
>> When he's like that even miss gil more here can't calm him down. I think maybe I'm a little bit of a mama substitute to him. And I could usually say, would you talk to your mama that way. And it usually helps him. 
>> Aderibigbe recently found himself in a different kind of trouble when an 11-foot rope and the sculpture of a head were discovered inside his cell, raising concerns about a possible escape attempt. Aderibigbe says the items were only for exercise and recreation. After further review, internal affairs investigator frank littlejohn says the evidence appears to support aderibigbe's story. 
>> With his history of violence that's landed him not only in prison, but in a lockdown unit where he's separated from the population because of his assaultive history, you can't ever take anything that appears innocent at face value. 
>> The rope was taken away but aderibigbe was given permission to continue sculpting. 
>> Lukuman has been very instrumental in controlling his anger. And it's so beautifully done. 
>> Everything is made from newspaper, and water, and I mix them with the soap. So now, this is just the beginning. I'm still making pit I have to let it sit for like two days but I put a face on it. Sculpting with soap, and a little bit of hot water. All the sculptures I've been making. It feels good when I'm doing it. It keeps from thinking of negative thoughts, and getting out of trouble. 
>> It definitely gives him an outlet. And I'm very proud of him for that. 
>> Once everything is done, it will come out real good and real beautiful and look great. 

[00:37:11]


>>> Miles folsom has found a constructive way to spend his time in prison. He was recently give any job in one of the prison's industrial shops which among other things makes electronics for businesses from indiana. 
>> They send a lot of things through here to be made. But I'm pretty sure this specific wire harness is for the light in a vending machine. I have been working for a week and a half now. 7:00 in the morning, come down here and work unti3:00 in the afternoon. I mean, it's not bad. 
>> Folsom hopes after a few years of good behavior he can file an appeal to have his sentence reduced. 
>> So I'll be able to say, your honor, I've been working, I've earned my own money, I've stayed out of trouble for this many years. Because I don't want to stay here. I don't think anybody wants to stay here. I got plans, I got goals and I'm looking to get out and go for them. 
>> But folsom's goals are dependent on his ability to stay out of trouble, which in prison isn't always easy. 
>> I stay reserved no matter what. I mean you never want to put yourself on the line, because you know when something hits the fan then you're left out to dry. You know, you're just hanging there. I mean these people they don't care nothing about you. 
>> There is one inmate whose advice folsom values. 
>> One of the few I talk to, i call him stone. He has been down a long time. If you look at his record that is not someone who wants to stay out of trouble you would want to hang around with. But I mean really the guys that have been in trouble before that have been down 20 or 30 years they came in at my age. They took the wrong path at that time and they don't want to see me take the wrong path so they're guiding me the right way. 
>> Going to stoneyland. 
>> Taking you to stoneyland. 
>> Look at that little vein. What the hell? You got a vein popping out, dude. You know that? Your brain. He's gone. You ready? 
>> I've been ready. 
>> Don't depend on others. That's how I made it 26 years. I don't depend on nobody. A lot of these cats might seem cool but they ain't cool. 

[00:39:18]


>> There's a lot of jomos and homos too. 
>> You got a bunch of those in here. And you peepee men on here. You have any questions on something like that or someone wants to run his mouth or something like that there, wonder what it's about, don't jump out there like a fool, you end up with your ass on lockup. Let us know and we'll take it to them ourselves. Do it the hard way or we can do it the easy way. Believe me, they'll go the easy way. 
>> Yeah, I appreciate it, man. 
>> On one condition, quit beating my ass in handball. Let a [ bleep ] win sometimes. 
>> Ball. 
>> Supposed to be the master teaching the grass hopper and i doesn't been the larva now. What the hell is up with that? 
>> It's easy to fall into trouble. It's like, people you know, they'll say something smart. If I was on the street I would be so messed up that I mean there would be no thinking about it. It would just blow. And one could get hurt. You know like now you just can't do that. That's not normal. You got to control yourself. 
>> He's young. He's got a long ways to go. I was in the same boat. You know? I used to do the same stuff. But at least he's got a chance. At least he's got a chance to get back out there. That's what he's got the think of. Screws up, he ends up like me. I done lost everything. 
>> Even his handball game. 
>> Just hit a man while he's done. Oh, man. If I had an "s" right there. That's right. That means stone. 
>> It sucks. 
>> Stone. James stone. Stone sucks. 

[00:41:19]


>> Hey, sir. 
>> Coming up. 
>> Some staff here have been recommended you be released and some haven't. 
>> I'd like to know -- 
>> christopher trotter makes his case for returning to general population. 
>> Nobody said kill the police or anything like that. I'm not in here for killing the police. And I haven't killed the police. He just took it out of context. 

[00:45:01]


>>> At indiana's wabash valley correctional facility, inmates that have committed violent acts or are otherwise deemed safety threats are housed in windowless singleman cells inside the secured confinement unit. They are only allowed one hour a day for recreation. 
>> Sometimes we come out here and say blessed. It's sunny today. You know what I'm saying? 
>> When weather permits, inmates may spend that hour outdoors although they are still contained within a single-man metal enclosure. 
>> I ain't good at basketball. You know. But we play soccer. Today, I'm happy to come out here and get to see the sun and smile, you know. Do the time you get everything off your chest. Once I go back to that room. It's like night and day. 
>> Having spent the last nine years and 16 of the last 28 years in confinement, christopher trotter values every moment outside. 
>> Okay. This is what I call the old man workout. This is how we do it. One -- I haven't lost touch with humanity. I refuse to lose touch with humanity. When you lose that, that's it. That's it. When you let this place strip you, that's it. 
>> One -- 
>> trotter recently filed a request to be transferred from confinement back to general population where he would have considerably more freedom. 
>> Five, six, seven -- 
>> because he was at the center of a 1985 riot one of the most violent incidents in the history of the indiana state prison system, the request must be approved by multiple levels of administration. Including wabash's superintendent, dick brown. 
>> I'm coming down to talk to chris trotter. He asked to be released from departmentwide administrative segregation. So I'm coming down to speak to him about that review. He'll be meeting with the team manager jerry synder, casebook manager beverly gilmore and myself. 

[00:47:07]


>> Hello. Hi sir, how you doing. Haven't seen you in a long time. 
>> I know, it's been a long time. 
>> Yeah, yeah, it's been a long time. 
>> Some staff have recommended you be released from departmentwide administrative segregation. Some staff haven't. Okay? So with that being said, it's now in my hands to make a recommendation to central office. 
>> Though trotter has shown improvement one of the first things superintendent brown wants to address is a conduct report that he received several months earlier. 
>> Chris trotter started saying over and over "f" the police, kill the police. That sounds like a threat to me. 
>> No, but that wasn't it at all. That wasn't it. We were working out together on the range and we had our chin after the workout and he took it out of context and nobody said kill the police or anything like that. I'm not in here for killing the police and I haven't killed the police. You know, and he just took it out of context and it was basically to discourage us from, you knowfurther showing a sign of unity. You know -- 
>> someone approaches me and states if I'm going to kill me -- if I'm the correctional officer -- 
>> he was way up in the pod. I'm way in cell 6. He was up in the pod. How can he determine who said what. 
>> You have a very distinctive voice. Do you not? 
>> But I'm saying several of us, it's a whole range of people hollering the same thing. Let me say this to you, in 1985 when I got involved in that prison riot, I don't regret it for the simple fact is this. I felt that I was doing the right thing in my hearts of hearts. I wasn't committing a crime i was preventing a crime. But am I remorseful? Yes. For the simple fact is people got hurt. Not just staff, not just prisoners, but families. So I'm remorseful in that sense. And what did I do about it? I haven't involved myself in anything since then. 

[00:49:13]


>> You know, that if you go out into general population, this new generation is going to want to challenge the infamous christopher trotter. How in the world are you going to deal with the bunch of punks coming up challenging you? 
>> First off, sticks and stones may break my bones but words will never hurt me. So I don't care what they say. You know. And as long as you don't put your hands on me, we all right. I haven't had no situation with nobody. I mean nobody, none. The only situation when I first came here I was here a month without my personal property. And I dealt with that in a good manner. 
>> You dealt in that with a loud manner. I remember. 
>> Well, I got a tame tongue, not an untame tongue. Seriously. 
>> You think highly of yourself, do you know that? 
>> That's the difference, though. That's the difference. 
>> I would really like to be able to see christopher trotter go back to general population, because of the length of time he has been in segregation. But should he go? I'm so thankful I'm not making that decision. 
>> Bottom line here is where we're at. It is up to me now to make that recommendation. Okay. Like I said, some staff here in this unit have recommended you be released. Some haven't. 
>> I'd like to know who haven't. 
>> No, you're not going to know who. Who did and who didn't, okay? The important thing to know is that it's in my hands now. Okay. So doesn't matter what the other staff recommended. It's up to me now. So the responsibility is at my level. All right, well appreciate your time. And that concludes the questions I had for you. 
>> Thanks so much. 
>> Thank you. Appreciate it. Unfortunately if I make the wrong decision here, if I do recommend that he's released and then something happens, then that burden is upon my shoulders. 
>>> Coming up -- james stone reaches out to an old friend. 
>> Do you time with the cat for 15 years and you just miss having them around. ] easy, up in the middle of the night it can be frustrating. It's hard to turn off and go back to sleep.

>>> this here's one of the best meals we have in the menu, the taco. We still ain't figured out what the meat is. We've narrowed the meat down to alpacas or guineas or could be a combination of both. An alpac-guinea. 
>> James stone's humorous perspective has helped him survive 26 years in some of indiana's toughest maximum security prisons. 
>> I stay in stoneyland. You know. I don't need no psychotherapist. I don't need medication. I [ bleep ] a lot. I'm not saying I'm a saint. I'm far from a saint. That's probably why I'm still alive today. I should have been dead several times long time ago, but evidently heaven don't want me and hell's afraid I'm going to take over. So I'm pretty well stuck here on this planet. 
>> But stone hasn't completely resigned himself to life at wabash valley. He's requested a transfer back to the prison where he used to be housed, indiana state. 
>> I know they didn't have no problem moving me out. I don't know why it should be a big problem moving me back up there now. 
>> Stone's motivation for the transfer is to reunite with his cat jinkster. 
>> When I do feel like I'm about ready to go do something stupid, you look at those big betty davis eyes and you think, hey, this guy depends on me, I've got to take care of him. 
>> Stone received jinkster as part of the cat adoption program at indiana state. He had to leave him behind when he was transferred to wabash. For the first several weeks, jinkster lived with another inmate. But then jinkster moved out to the country. He was adopted by stone's parents. 
>> Jinkster is something else. He's not used to carpeting. And cloth furniture. Everything was claws. I mean, he clawed up carpet, everything else. But, it was worth it because it was jim's. 

[00:56:31]


>> Some people might not quite understand it. But my family we view our pets as family members. So you know, this was sort of like jim's kid. 
>> Talk about your daddy. Yeah. 
>> It's really, really hard for me to talk about jim. I love him so much. When he was a little boy, he loved to go for these walks. And we'd go for a long walk. He'd give out and I'd put him on my shoulders and bring him on in. I'm 69 years old and my worst fear is I'll never get to walk through the woods with him. Jim would love it out here. He's such an outdoorsman. One of the reasons we got this place. It's everything that he would want. 
>> We all miss him. Yeah. Every day. There's not a day that goes by that I don't think of my brother. We just love to see him home. 
>> But for now, stone's family and his old friend jinkster communicate regularly by phone. 
>> I call home every once in a while since I couldn't bring him here with me and my family's got a speaker phone. 
>> To accept the call press zero. Go ahead with your call. 
>> Hello? 
>> Hi, jim. 
>> Everybody doing all right? When he is in a room I'll just holler for him. Jinkster. Jinkster. Jinkster. Meow. Jinkster. I don't know what that means but I got it from an old tarzan movie and elephants stampeded. Well, when I holler it to him, his little fat ass stampedes, too. Jinkster. 
>> He's there, jim. 
>> Then when I give the old cat call he starts purring and stuff. What's up, little buddy? 
>> Talk to papa. 
>> [ Purring ] 
>> yeah, good boy. 

[00:58:34]


>> Dad all right? 
>> He got his tail going 90 miles per hour. 
>> You can hear him purring real loud into it. So he might have forgot who I am but he knows the call. Well, tell everyone I said hello. 
>> Okay, honey. Love you. 
>> Love you jimbo. 
>> You all be good. 
>> Okay. 
>> Bye-bye. 
>> Miss your papa? Yeah. 
>> I still miss my little buddy. I mean when you do your time with a cat for 15 years, you just -- you miss having them around. You know. But, yeah, I said I hope I get out of here so I can pick my little buddy back up. Not a whole lot else I want to say except jinkster if you're out there and you're looking at the tv screen right now, it's me you little fella? You know what that means little fella. My little fur ball buddy. Hopefully I'll get out there soon. You can show me what the free world's about.

>>> Due to mature subject matter, viewer discretion is advised. 
>>> I don't beat around the bush when it comes to the racist term. I'm absolutely a racist. 
>> Inmates find themselves in racial conflict. 
>> He and two white offenders were involved with assaulting a black offender. 
>> Anything can pop off from this situation, you know? You've got haters everywhere you go. 
>> But some seek conflict elsewhere. 
>> Child molesters are the crap on the bottom of my boot if i were out tending stalls. 
>> All of a sudden, they were kicking and kneeing and punching, and pretty brutally at that. 
>> He and his cellmate had 22 shanks hidden in their light fixture. 
>> I try to make mine at least 10 inches long, so I have plenty of handle room and plenty of blade. And we turned the cameras over to the inmates so they can record their personal thoughts in private. 
>> You and your thoughts and these walls, if you ain't strong, man, you're going to crumble. 
>>> Nobody want to die in jail, with their blood and their guts all around their cell. But now I'm in the state, locking in that tin, waking up at eight, not taking to the weight. If I cannot appeal, I'm going to bring it to these pigs. Grab an ice pick and bring it to these rigs. Leave a scar from their belly to their jig. Some may not make it home, some may stay for life. Some blown bleep with swords and others look for christ. Some [ bleep ] live for peace, and others live for wreck. Look here, blood, you can stay humble or you can have a fight to the death. That's just a couple bars, man, throwaway bars, man. You know, donations, man, you know. That's a d-boy's life.

>> Carlton wright says he takes the rage he learned on the streets in plainfield, new jersey, and pours it into rap. Now he's one of more than 2,000 inmates at the wabash valley correctional facility in southwestern indiana. 
>> Yeah, I had a great home, a great mother. You know what I mean? But by the same token, when i step outside my front door, it's the jungle. Coming home from school, you may get into a fight, you may get jumped, you may get shot, you know what I mean, may get harassed by the police, but when you grow up around that, it becomes normal. You get accustomed to it, and some may make it out of the neighborhood, if you can see an alternative lifestyle. But a lot of people get consumed in a lifestyle that leads to prison or death. The street don't give you too many bright endings, man. I ran the streets, man. I did the street life. I'm in here washing clothes by hand and eating bull [ bleep ] chicks like that. On the street, I wear high white t-shirt one time and throw it away and buy a new one. Here I'm washing it every day. You make do with what you've got in prison, you know? The things you think you'll never do out on the street is like a luxury in here. This is everything, your kitchen, your bathroom, your laundry room, your bedroom, all in one cell. 
>> And you share it with another person. 
>> Another bro man who farts and pisses and whatever else he do, you know, you're stuck in here and you're forced to deal with it. So you better pray you got a cool cellie, or it ain't going to work. Being in prison, it's reality, man. You know, people watching movies in prison, and you see them, oh, that's sad, and you turn it off and forget about it, but it's our life. You know, we wake up every day to this, living under these strict set of rules, no privileges, you know what i mean. This is reality. There's no going home from this. 

[00:04:15]


>> And wright is a long way from home. 
>> This is my first time ever in indiana. I never lived in indiana prior to being incarcerated. I was here for two days before i caught my case. I originally ended up in kentucky, but I crossed the state line looking for a walmart and I ended up in indiana. 
>> Wright might have been looking for a walmart, but his trip to indiana involved more than shopping. 
>> I was pimping on my girlfriend -- well, you can call her a girlfriend, female companion, whatever. Yeah, I was pimping. So that's what I was doing from state to state, for income. I've got good communication skills. Communication is my occupation. I'm talkative, I meet different people. Believe it or not, a lot of people are looking to have a good time. My co-defendant, you know, was a pretty young lady and basically, you know, sells herself. Sex is a billion dollar industry. 
>> Reporter: Wright's troubles began when he and his female companion met a potential john at their hotel. It was christmas eve. 
>> We went back to his home, spent time there. On the way back to the hotel, things got heated and out of control, and, you know, she pulled a weapon out and she shot him. 
>> The victim was shot in the head. Wright threw him out of his vehicle and left him for dead, but he survived, and a short time later, wright and his companion were arrested. She was sentenced to 30 years while wright received the maximum 50 years for robbery, bodily injury, and criminal confinement. But he feels another factor contributed to his sentence. 
>> I believe the laws is more stronger on black guys here. I mean, that's my personal opinion. My whole jury was white, you know? I didn't have nobody in my peers, so they probably couldn't understand this type of crime or understand what happened. They just associate black people with violence. He did it. Convict him. 
>> Wright believes his race is also a detriment at wabash. 
>> I'm on the wrong side of the color margin. That's just honesty. This prison is predominantly white people, you know what i mean? You know, I'm not saying they're racist. You've got people walking around with swastikas and hitler tattoos, and it throws me off, like, damn, man, this is their prison. You know what I mean? They're comfortable with doing it because it's their prison. 

[00:06:25]


>> Gerald richey is exactly the kind of inmate that wright tries to avoid. 
>> People like to dance around the "racist" word. They'll do anything in the world to not be called a racist. I don't beat around the bush when it comes to the racist term. I'm absolutely a racist. People like to say we're in a quote/unquote post-racial society and that race doesn't matter and that race is insignificant. If race didn't matter, there wouldn't be different races. All people ain't the same, you know? 
>> Ritchie is four months away from completing a two-year sentence for intimidation of a peace officer. He is also member of a prison gang called the saxon knights. 
>> The aryan brotherhood and sax knights are similar. They both share similar ideologies in their creeds and oaths and in their bylaws. 
>> That's another one right there that I'm most proud of. My saxon knight crest with the bolts. 
>> He actually was the saxon knight president for this facility at one time. These organizations start taking possession of certain parts of the facility, such as where they were working out, the saxon knights will say they own that part of the facility and no other offenders are allowed to go on that turf without paying some sort of consequence. 
>> Richec and two other white inmates recently dished out consequences when they attacked a black inmate. 
>>> Coming up -- 
>> the three white guys running around assaulting the one guy here. 
>> Prison staff break down gerald richie's assault while two other inmates break the racial divide. 
>> They've been doing this on camera, jeopardizing the situation for real. I'm almost 185 pounds of real vision, and I don't think they want to see [ bleep ].

[00:11:30]


>>> At the wabash valley correctional facility in southwesest indiana, prison officials allowed us to give cameras to some of the inmates in order to let them record personal thoughts in the privacy of their cells. Among them was carlton wright. 
>> Dining time is a [ bleep ], man. It's nothing but you and your thoughts and these brick walls. You feel me? And if you ain't strong, man, you're going to crumble? You know what I mean? Until you walk in my shoes and did this, you can't tell what it's like, man. It's hard. Doing time is hard. 
>> During his time at wabash, wright says he's felt vulnerable because of the color of his skin. 
>> Other prisons I've been at, it's more populated, you know what I mean, with hispanics and blacks, but this is heavily populated white prison. It's a culture shock. 
>> But not every inmate at wabash is concerned with maintaining a racial divide. Adrian davis and tim harris have found some common ground. Particularly when it comes to personal style. Davis regularly helps harris figure out what to do with his afro-like hair. 
>> It's harder braiding white dude's hair than black guys. So I've got to part it certain ways and put more rubber bands in it to hold it. 
>> My hair's only been growing for five months, so I've only got it braided two or three times. It's starting to get to the length where I want it. Probably in another month or so, I'll be able to do a little more with it. 
>> But both men know that their friendship comes with risks. 
>> I mean, some white guys don't get it, so white guys who do get it, braids, they usually mess with black guys period. They chop it up with us they converseate with us. The ones who don't, you going to know, but they either got swastikas or they got -- even doing this on camera is a jeopardizing situation for real. People will be like, man, why you do that on camera? Why you braiding another dude? You know what I mean? Anything can pop off from this situation? 

[00:13:31]


[ Bleep ] you know, you got haters everywhere you go. 
>> Why do you do it then? 
>> Because I'm not afraid of nobody. I've got 30 years. What you going to do me that i can't do to you? I'm almost 185 pounds of something real vicious, and i don't think they want to see that. 
[ Bleep ] 
>> davis' 30-year sentence is for dealing cocaine. Harris has ten yea for theft and burglary, but he's been crossing racial lines long before prison. 
>> You know, you have, you know, your white organizations and then you have your black organizations, and then you have, like me, I'm a white organization that's affiliated with a black organization. 
>> It says "white boy from the hood." That is where I'm from. I can't never change where I'm from. I can change where I'm going in life, but not where I'm from. My nickname is i.G. I'm an insane gangster so they call me i.G. They've been calling me that for probably about ten years now. I mean, we have black members in the insane, but more white than black. It's more white people. WE'RE -- G.D.s ARE MORE OUR Black branch, you know, right there, as far as we are. We're just a branch off of them. Brothers with a struggle, you know? We struggle to survive together, and, you know, we're here for each other. Me, personally, I don't oo many problems. I haven't had words with nobody since I've been transferred here. It's been more or less peaceful for me. You know, I hang out with a little bit of everybody. A lot of blacks, a lot of whites. You know, I meet in the middle with everybody. 
>> Gerald ritchie, a member of the white supremacist gang, the saxon knights, doesn't believe such harmony between blacks and whites is possible. 
>> We're two different beings from head to the toe, from root to crown. Not compatible. We are not compatible. The only time a white dude is compatible with a black dude in a cell if, a, he's a fag, or, b, he wants to be black. That's the cold, hard truth about it. People are going to watch this on the news and hate me for it. Believe that. 

[00:15:44]


>> And prison officials believe racial pride might have contributed to a recent assault that landed ritchie in the secured confinement unit. 
>> What you see here is you'll see ritchie, and there's another guy, a guy out here, and basically they're just hanging out. They already know what's playing. I mean, it was premeditated. 
>> The men are waiting for a black inmate to exit his cell. 
>> He's immediately met by ritchie. He was actually standing at his door waiting for the door to be opened. And he assaults him and chases him around with another. This guy here is just kind of being a spectator at this point. You'll see another inmate come running from this side that also aids. Now you've got the three white guys running around, assaulting the one guy here. And, finally, they corner him and get him down and all three of them get on him before the officers can actually respond and activate their chemical agents. 
>> The victim received treatment at a nearby hospital, and ritchie was transferred to the segregation unit. 
>> He has been extremely disruptive and disorderly in our general population. And I've given him multiple chances, so that's the reason i chose to place him in administrative segregation. 
>> Ritchie feels the prison went too far, and during his interview had something to say to staff about it. 
>> With all due respect, you know, to you guys, you know, mind your business, man. Mind your business, man. If I'm not killing this man or little joey down on the range ain't getting raped, man, just be cool, man. Be cool. We don't want no trouble. We live here. 
>> Ritchie claims the fight wasn't racially motivated but over a small debt. 
>> It was over a couple dollars. That's about what it comes down to. There was a few choice words, and I really don't want to delve too deep into it because I'm not the only one involved in this. I don't want to implicate or talk about anybody else or anything of that nature. 
>>> Coming up -- 
>> this is what I don't like to see. Those are razor blades. 
>> Inmate-made shanks and one of the inmates who makes them. 

[00:17:45]


>> If it was big enough to put in your hand with a little left over, it will be big enough to be sharpened into a weapon. Alli can help you lose one more by blocking some of the fat you eat. Let's fight fat with alli. ?????? ?????? like cereals. Fiber One. Uh, forgot Jack's cereal. 

[00:20:06]


[ Jack ] What's for breakfast? Um... Try the Number One! Yeah, this is pretty good. 
[ Male Announcer ] Over a third of a day's fiber. Fiber One. 
>>> In my neck of the woods, if you've got a problem with a guy, you -- you -- you -- and mind you, nobody -- nobody calls the cops. You go outside. One of you get beat up. You go back into the bar, and the guy that won buys the beer. 
>> My name is joshua coffey, but everybody calls me country. 
>> Why do they call you country? 
>> Because I was raised in the sticks. I stole some copper from a local junkyard, and the proprietor of the junkyard owed me some money, and like an idiot, I stole from him instead of trying to go about it the correct way. Figure I learned that lesson the wrong way. 
>> Joshua coffey has served more than four s of his six-year sentence at the wabash valley correctional facility. His job inhe kitchen helps him stay focused and out of trouble. 
>> That's crazy. I came in at 4:30 this morning, and I'll leave about 5:30. So I work 13 hours. 

[00:22:10]


>> Stacking the line! 
>> The reason I do it is to get out of my cell, you know, come down here, get a little freedom. You know, eat a little better. The food that they serve doesn't taste bad, but its appeal is horrible. Some of the food they serve us looks like cat food. And I'm not even joking. I swear, if you put the food that they give us in a bowl and put a can of premium quality cat food and put it there in front of the inmate -- I'm not even saying a cat -- put it in front of a person that's locked up, they're probably going to eat the cat food. 
>> Tonight's meal is macaroni, mixed vegetables, bread, butter, and a cookie. While not everyone agrees on the best meal, there seems to be a consensus on the worst. 
>> The sloppy joe is bad, but that chicken a la king, oh, my god! I was getting ready to say, i swear you could take a can of alpo and dump it on a plate, and I would rather eat the alpo. 
>> Coffey will soon be able to broaden his food choices. He is due to be released on parole in three months and has a message for his future self. 
>> You're a dumbass, ain't you? Look, you sitting on the couch drinking a beer right now laughing at yourself, aren't you? You idiot! 
>> Nice hands, baby! 
>> Short of being released, the strongest sense of freedom most wabash inmates ever experience is their time on the outdoor recreation yards. 
>> See the left hand, huh? 
>> For the record, we won that game. 
>> While rec is a time to enjoy some fresh air and exercise, it is also one of the times inmates are most likely to exchange contraband, including shanks. 

[00:24:11]


>> Tell us what's going on out here. 
>> Well, right now they're patting down the convicts that are going back in from recreation, to check and make sure they don'have any weapons. I guess thers been a tip that there was going to be some trouble. The officers just line them up, pat them down one at a time, make sure they don't have any weapons on them, pretty much as they come back in, and you'll find a bunch of times after that happens, they'll find a bunch of stuff thrown in the grass. 
>> As the pat-downs are conducted, other officers walk the yard searching for discarded weapons. 
>> The inmates were standing watching the game. On this bench over here is always a good place. You'll see a shank. It could be buried just right underneath the grass. That's the place where they'll drop it and hide it and kick it with their foot right into the grass. They want to dispose of it before we pat them down and go back in the house. This is what I don't like to see. This right here. Those are razor blades. That's not something you want to step on. Really not something I like picking up. I don't care if you think that's a harmless piece of plastic, but they can literally melt that into here, and then you've got a slashing tool. Toothbrush handles and stuff like that. They're quite good at that. 
>> One inmate in particular at wabash has developed a reputation for his prolific production of homemade weapons. 
>> Brandon siverly has been in possession of multiple weapons multiple different times, which has eventually landed him in administrative segregation. Not only does he make the weapons, but he also stores them for organizations or individuals of multiple organizations. At one time he and his cellmate had 22 shanks hidden in their light fixture. 
>> Brandon siverly would craft knives out of nearly any object he found on prison grounds. 
>> If it was big enough to put in your hand with a little left over, it was big enough to be sharpened into a weapon. Usually I would just keep it on me because it's no good if it's hidden somewhere. If somebody comes on to you and 

[00:26:16]


[ bleep ], you ain't got it on you, you can't tell him, hold on, let me go get my knife. Thankfully, I've never had to use one. Usually if somebody sees one, it's enough to keep th at bay. So you don't usually have to use it. I was prepared to use it. 
>> Siverly was 17 years old when he and a group of friends broke into a home and beat and robbed the occupant. He accepted a plea bargain and was sentenced to 20 years. While at wabash, however, he received an additional four-year sentence for possession of a dangerous device, a seven-inch-long shank. 
>> That's a baby. That's a baby. Before that, I always tried to make mine at least 10 inches long. That way I had plenty of handle room and plenty of blade. 
>> Siverly's history has resulted him in being housed in e highly restrictive secured confinement unit. While he doesn't like it, he does understand it. 
>> From their standpoint, how can you have somebody who keeps repeatedly getting caught making mass quantities of knifes in population and keep population safe? Even if that person's not stabbing people, he's making the knives that are stabbing people. 
>> With few possessions and little, if any, contact with other inmates, siverly has refocused his energy from weapons to art. 
>> President barack obama, commander in chief of the united states of america. Greatest nation ever. So I figured "we fight" was a good statement. You know, barack obama being half black, the battle he had to fight to get just where he's at, I figured it was a bold statement. 
>> While siverly might respect obama's battles, he is firm and he won't help black inmates in wabash with theirs. 
>> I'm not racist, but then again, I know where the lines are in here. So I know that if something goes down, just because I'm not racist doesn't mean if there's a race riot that they're not going to stab me, too. I'm not going to arm a black so that a race riot can pop off at any time and all the blacks in the dorms got a knife and, you know, one or two white people's got a knife, so I'm on the losing end. Eventually one of them's going to get to me. So I don't want to arm anybody that's going to potentially come back and use it on me, at all. 

[00:28:35]


>>> Coming up -- 
>> they all think they're "gq" material. 
>> Inmate picture day at wabash. 
>> Your feet can't be on the wall. 
>> Feet can't be on the wall? Man, you're so strict here. 
>>> And carlton wright causes a disturbance. 
>> I came back, [ bleep ]. 

[00:31:59]


>>> Here's what's happening. Vice president joe biden says he will meet personally with any of the family of the newtown school tragedy. His panel on gun violence is expected to give the president its recommendation by tuesday. 
>>> And a spokesperson for former president george h.W. Bush says they are hopeful he can be released from a houston hospital this coming week. The nation's oldest living ex-president has been hospitalized since just before thanksgiving. I'm veronica de la cruz. Now back to ockup." 
>>> Due to mature subject matter, viewer discretion is advised. 
>>> On the first wednesday of every month, inmates gather in the yard of indiana's wabash valley correctional facility to have their pictures taken by prison staff. 
>> Whole body again. 
>> It gives inmates an opportunity to connect with loved ones. 
>> Nah, I'm standing here waiting to get my picture taken so I can send them out to my people. I got a friend out there, she's been writing me off and on for the last three years, so I'll sender one and probably my grandma and my mom and dad. 
>> All the housing units get them once a month. 
>> For any inmate willing to pay $1.22, recreational coordinator mark cardinal will take a digital photo and deliver a set of four prints that can be sent to friends and family. 
>> What's the biggest challenge for you, taking all these pictures? 
>> Trying to please them all. They all think they're "gq" material. 
>> You get four copies. Print them out on one sheet. Four pictures on one sheet, so it ain't too bad of a deal. Other prisons you get one picture for it. 
>> Tim harris is one inmate who never misses picture day. 
>> Every month. This one right here is actually a photo that I took that last month's pictures, which you can see it has a different background. We took this one inside of rec. So I got my fro out in that one, it's looking a little bit rough. So I didn't send these out too much. I passed these ones out to the guys that I hang around with here, so they had a picture of me to put in their photo album. 

[00:34:08]


>> The sun is bright. 
>> Makes a good picture. 
>> I can't really see too much. The sun is too bright. It's kind of reflecting off the screen. I couldn't see it too good. I guess when it prints out, we'll see how good it is. 
>> Feet can't be on the wall. 
>> Can't be on the wall? Man, you're so strict! 
>> Prilike this are reserved for general population inmates with good behavior records. Carlton wright, who is one year into a 50-year sentence for robbery has mostly stayed out of trouble. 
>> I can't see it? 
>> Carlton wright actually came to prison in 2010, and since he's been in, he's received a few conduct reports, nothing severe. I had heard that he has a mouth on him and that he's pretty disrespectful towards staff and other offenders. 
>> That's the only option? I can't take another one? 
>> Nope. 
>> So what was the point of seeing -- there was no point of really seeing it, then, right? 
>> Pretty much. 
>> You don't like it? This is wabash, man. They do what they want to do. I'm not like a lot of inmates. I obey the rules here, you know, but sometimes they really want you to be compliant, you know, like puppets. Don't do this, don't do that. Do it like this, do it like that. 
[ Bleep ] here, eat here, no, can't talk to that person, get off the door! All this [ bleep ] rules. I'm in jail for not [ bleep ] following the rules. 
>> Wright says his attitude is the result of growing up in a tough new jersey neighborhood. 
>> Either you sink or swim, you know what I mean? And I grew a hard exterior because I didn't want to be the victim, and over the course of time, that became a part of my character. 
>> And recently wright's character was put to the test. 
>> He came back from recreation one night and noticed that his tv had been missing, so obviously he knew someone had took it. So he was pretty upset about that, as anybody would be. 
>> This is the penitentiary. Are you serious? People [ bleep ] kill for that, for real, for real. 

[00:36:13]


>> Surveillance video from the unit shows another inmate standing outside wright's cell. He then enters the cell and then seconds later exits with wright's television. The inmate then places the tv inside another cell. 
>> Someone stole my tv while i was gone, so, you know, when i came back and [ bleep ] things got ugly. 
>> From what I heard, he approached several offenders, kind of called them out, wanting to know if they had taken his tv. 
>> I started going from cell to cell, searching my [ bleep ]. I'm going to search everybody's 
[ bleep ] until I find what I'm looking for. 
>> Wright's aggressive behavior soon created problems with other inmates. 
>> I'm not looking for trouble, but at the same time, I'm definitely not docking none either. You feel me? You know, this is the penitentiary. You've got to stand tall, ten toes down? You know what I mean? You can't take no losses? You know what I mean? It's the wrong place to be a bitch. You feeling me? It's the pressure? You feeling me? You get killed for stealing on the streets, so why not in prison? 
>> As wright continued his tirade, staff became concerned it would lead to a fight and sanctioned wright for taking matters into his own hands. He was transferred to administrative segregation in the custody control unit or ccu. 
>> Welcome to the belly of the beast, man. I hate lockup. 
[ Bleep ] back here, for real, for real. Just make your time hard. All you do is think. Ain't no books in this bitch or nothing. When you're in ccu, you don't get really nothing but a bar of soap, some toothpaste, a pair of shower shoes. You're a really in survival mode back here. My hair [ bleep ], I ain't able to get a hair cut or a shave, 
[ bleep ] none of that. I've been back here just slumming it, you know. This is the downside of prison, you know what I mean? Violence happens, you know? What do you expect? You throw a bunch of violent offenders together and you expect us not to clash? At the end of the day, you better pray you're the one left standing and not hurting. 
>> As authorities continue to investigate the stolen tv, wright has petitioned to be placed back into his original housing unit. 
>> At this point, I don't know what's going to be allowed to happen with wright, I don't know if he'll be allowed to return to p-house because of all the animosity he caused himself that night for all the accusations about his tv, so I'm sure we'll be evaluating his housing assignment. 

[00:38:30]


>> While authorities determine a safe housing placement for wright, he will remain in confinement. 
>> I don't like it, but I'm adapting. I got to make it work, you know what I mean? These people place you in all kinds of situations to try to crumble you or break you, but I'm surviving. That's what I'm doing, man. I'm surviving. I've got too much time to start crumbling now. 
>> Gerald ritchie is also in one of the confinement units, and he's not happy about it. 
>> It's horrible. They had punishment in mind when they built this place. That's a fact. Let's make these guys understand that, hey, if you come to prison, this is how you're going to live. This is how you're going to live, and we're going to take THESE RULES TO THE Nth DEGREE. 
>> Ritchie says that even though he's in confinement for being one of three white inmates caught assaulting a black inmate, the fight was not racially motivated. But he admits his tattoos are. 
>> My swastika. Even though it's not necessarily the best artistically, it's one of the ones that I'm most proud of, because it means the most on the whole. It's empowering and uplifting. It's a symbol, man. Not only does it elicit a response from others, but it elicits a response from myself. That's what symbolism does for you. That's what symbolism has done for people since the beginning of whenever. The right hand is mine, and the left hand means honor. So together they say "my honor." And it's the first half of our motto that hitler gave the ss which is my honor is loyalty. They're meant to say something to you without spitting it out and blurting it. So when I look in the mirror, i see these things, man, and I'm on the right track and doing the right thing, man. It makes me feel good. 
>> When weather permits, confinement inmates are allowed one hour of outdoor recreation. It's in a small cage-like enclosure, but it provides the one chance ritchie has to see friends, like brandon siverly. 
>> What's happening? 
>> Just chilling. 
>> It's hot out. 
>> Super hot. 

[00:40:34]


>> Cool to get out here in the afternoon anyway. 
>> A lot better out in the afternoon. You don't get chance to see the sun a whole lot. 
>> Ritchie, he's a really good dude. Good person. Don't let anybody say you can't make friends in prison. See that, j.J.? 
>> What happened? 
>> That's why I didn't play basketball. 
>> No. You see that? That's why I don't play basketball. That's why I was sitting right there. It ain't even rocking. 
>> That's 0-3 right there. I'm on a roll. 
>>> Coming up -- 
>> well, there was a child molester that got mouthy with one of my buddies, and it escalated quickly, and he took an ass whooping. 
>> An act of violence threatens joshua coffey's release from wabash. 
>> The victim gets up, and then they grab him, just shove him against that rail and begin kicking him and hitting him. ?????? ??????

[ Male Announcer ] HOW ABOUT V8 V-FUSION. A full serving of vegetables, a full serving of fruit. But what you taste is the fruit. So even you... Could've had a v8. 
>> Let me give you a quick look around my cell. Let me show you what's going on with my cell. This is my bed here, you know, what I sleep on. This is my cellie rack right above me. This is his bed where another grown ass man sleeps at. You understand? Out here to the left is my window. That's my window. That's the gate that teases me with freedom. And right there is the highway, I think. See the cars going by, going places I can't go. You feel me? So just trying to paint a picture for you so you can understand what I'm going through. 
>> Carlton wright's picture will change very little in the next 24 years. That's when he's eligible for parole on his 50-year sentence for robbery, bodily injury, and criminal confinement. 
>> You want to go out right now? All right. 
>> But he has had one bit of good news. He has been released from the confinement unit. He was sent there for threatening other inmates while trying to locate his stolen tv set. 
>> Whatever happened with the guy who stole your tv? 
>> I don't know. I ain't seen him yet. 
>> Did you ever get your tv back? 
>> I got another one. 
>> So the guy who stole your tv was never prosecuted? He -- 
>> I don't know. I mean, this is wabash. I'm on a trip. This is a small prison. You'll bump up to him again. It's hard to live in a place like this for 40 years and not have an altercation. Everybody walks around with a chip on their shoulder. They're under a mindset of i don't give a [ bleep ], don't care. It's a small group of people. And we put a bunch of angry people in a small facility, 

[00:46:25]


[ bleep ]'s going to clash. 
[ Bleep ] happens like that. You never know what's [ bleep ] about to happen. You have to know what conversation not to get involved in, and how to [ bleep ] let go, because if not, you can be in the infirmary fighting for your life. That's what happens, you know? But it come with this prison 
[ bleep ], man. Kids don't see that [ bleep ]. They see money, they see this, what money can get me, but they don't see the consequence of the actions that come with it, until it's too late, you know? You can't really experience 
[ bleep ] until you living it. 
>> Me personally? I really don't have no problem with anybody. I may believe in my own set of personal values, but, I mean, I'm not going to -- I don't hate other people because of who or what they are. 
>> But there is one type of person that joshua coffey doesn't tolerate. And now one week away from his release, that intolerance will keep coffey in prison longer. 
>> Right now we're watching a video of an assault that happened in p-house unit. Right here you see offender anderson walking up the steps and offender coffey walking up behind him, and they're preparing to go into a cell and assault someone. 
>> Well, there was a child molester that got mouthy with one of my buddies and, honestly, it just kind of escalated quickly, and he took an ass-whooping. 
>> The first offender enters the cell with the second offender, offender coffey, standing outside the door, watching for staff, to make sure they're not going to see this. Anderson goes in and starts to rifle through some of the offender's stuff. It appears that anderson is talking to the victim and that they're having a bit of a disagreement. 
>> Child molesters, I think they should take them, chop off their junk, put them on an island, and let them just live together and eventually they would die off. If somebody molested my son, i don't want to come back to prison, but I probably would for murder. 

[00:48:26]


>> Here in just a second, you'll see where the victim gets up and starts to run out of the cell and tries to defend himself, and then they grab him, shove him against that rail, and begin kicking and hitting him. Then the door starts to shut, so they're all getting slammed in the door. Then right here you see both of them pushing him back into the cell. All the meanwhile, they're kicking and kneeing and punching, and pretty brutally, at that. And then when they decide that the victim has had enough, i guess, or they're worried about getting caught, they depart the area, and the victim is standing there on the upper range. His face is bloody, he's leaning against the rail for support, and he's holding his head. He's been worked over pretty good. 
>> I don't regret it, one bit. 
>> Did you beat him because he was a child molester or because of something else? 50/50. I mean, honestly, if the guy wasn't a child molester, it probably would have just blowed over. But child molesters are the -- they're the crap on the bottom of my boot if I was out tending stalls. Honestly, the guy's got 50 years, and I hope the rest of the time that he's incarcerated, he takes a whooping at least once a month. 
>> The incident resulted in a postponement of coffey's release. 
>> Offender coffey received commissary loss, segregation time, which was suspended, and then loss of good time. 
>> How much time did you lose? 
>> I only lost a week, but, you know, a week is a week. I regret losing time that i could have spent with my family. And you know what? I apologize. I sincerely apologize, guys. To be honest, I kind of lied to them why I lost a week. Because it's kind of hard to tell them the truth. When they see this, they're going to know the truth, but, you know, that's why i apologized, you know. Hopefully by then it will have -- everything is smoothed out. There's some people that, they honestly, they don't deserve a second chance. Now, I might be one of those people. I don't. Because, honestly, I had a second chance. I get released this time, this is my third chance. 

[00:50:49]


>>> Coming up -- 
>> every choice, there's a consequence, man. So before you do something, you've got to think, damn, what's the possible consequence that could happen behind this. 
>> Wabash inmates deal with the consequences of their choices. 
>> Some prison sentences don't end, you know what I mean? It's a hard pill to swallow. Card One, Olaf gets great rewards for his small business! Pizza!

[00:54:16]


>>> Not only are you bleeding like a [ bleep ], but you're doing 50 years. You know what 50 years feel like? People forget about you, man? And not out of spite like 
[ bleep ], but more or less like, life is busy, man, you know? The average person ain't going to slow down and reach out. 
>> The notion of being forgotten is something every inmate must contemplate at some point during their incarceration. 
>> That one? 
>> Yep. 
>> I can't do that over, man? 
>> There's me right there, where your finger is right there. 
>> Tim harris, serving ten years, makes it a point to never miss the prison's photo day, so that he can send pictures of himself to loved ones. 
>> That ain't bad. I think I should have one in there with some sweatpants on. 
>> All right, there. 
>> Took a couple pictures to send friends and family. And this is what they look like. As you can see, they're not the greatest quality ever, but they're pictures, you know? They look at them and they get the idea. You know, it's just nice to sometimes see your loved ones. This is the other one I took. It's hard for me. Now, you know, my brother, you know, me being locked up and his kids, he wrote me the other day, and when he wrote me, he said, the kids talk to everybody about you all the time and talk about how you used to do everything with them. It's kind of depressing and stressing, and it's hard to deal with. They ask about me all the time, but they know I'm locked up. They understand I'm just locked up, but I hate them having to know that I'm locked up. But I put myself here, and maybe me letting them know where I'm at and telling them how I feel about it will help them from having to come down this road that I do. 
>> Gerald ritchie is only one week away from completing his two-year sentence. 

[00:56:21]


>> Do the right thing. Got it figured out. I got it licked. I got it licked, I promise. I'll get the opportunity to get out twice. Got out and ended up coming back both times. I've got brothers in here, man, that are never getting out. Talk to people, it makes me feel like I'm selfish, like I'm not taking advantage of something that I absolutely need to take advantage of, because not everybody's got that chance. Some prison sentences don't end, you know what I mean? It's a hard pill to swallow. It's heavy [ bleep ]. I'm not trying to [ bleep ] die in here, but this, you know -- 
[ bleep ] good at it, but this? Just got to get out and stay sober and find a job. That's about what it comes down to. If I'm not drinking or doing drugs and I'm employed, how can you go wrong? What could happen? 
>> In spite of seeing his release get delayed by seven days because he chose to assault another inmate, joshua coffey is also preparing to go home. 
>> You already got a job? 
>> Yeah, my brother owns a construction company. 
>> Oh, that's cool. I got a job as soon as I want it. Hopefully. As long as he don't get pissed at me for something. 
>> How do you like that? Is that short enough or long enough? 
>> A little bit shorter. That's the one good thing. If it's not good, I'll wear a hat anyway. 
>> You won't be a hat out here? 
>> Oh, I guarantee I'll be wearing a hat. As a matter of fact, I'll be wearing this hat. This is my fishing hat now. I swear to god that. I will be wearing that hat when I go fishing every time. Wearing the hat, honestly, will remind me not to come back. Because I can't go fishing when I'm in jail. First day, I'm got that one all the way down. I'm getting out, I have nothing. So I'm going straight to the welfare office, and I'm going to get me my little $137 worth of food stamps so that I got something to eat. I'm going to the private salvation army to make sure I've got any type of hygiene materials or clothes I need. But after I get all those things done, I'm going to go see a re-entry coordinator, I'm going to call my parole officer, call the na coordinator, and then I'm going to the french lick casino. 

[00:58:54]


>> Thank you. 
>> Every choice has a consequence, man. So before you do something, you've got to think, damn, what's the possible consequence that could happen behind this, you know? And a lot of people don't think about that, man. A lot of people don't ponder the outcome of what they doing. They just do it until they realize, damn, man, this consequence is too harsh, what i just did. The reward don't outpay the risk. And before you know it, you're paying with your life, man. I'm paying with my life. I've got 50 years, man? You know, that's a life. I'm 27. 50 plus 27. 77 years old, are you serious? Come on, man. That's life.

>>> Due to mature subject matter viewer discretion is advised. 
>>> Msnbc takes you behind the walls of america's most notorious prisons into a world of chaos and danger. Now the scenes you've never 
seen, "lockup: Raw." 
>> On the ground. 
>> We're going to run military style. Strict. 
>> Before any inmate sees the inside of a prison, he's most like lie -- likely first seen the inside a jail. 
>> I'm just sitting in a room. I don't know if it's night or daylight. 
>> And nothing about jail is for the faint of heart. For some, jail is the ultimate limbo between freedom and a life behind bars. Or even worse. 
>> I've accepted the fact that a potential outcome of trial could be a death sentence. 
>> Andetter or worse, time in jail changes everyone. 
>> I'm afraid of how long he's already been in jail and that it would change him. I hope it doesn't change his heart. 
>> There are distinct differences between america's prisons, and jails. Prison is for inmates convicted of crimes and are now serving sentences. While some jail inmates are also serving sentences, the majority are not convicted, but are being held awaiting trial for the resolution of the charges for which they were arrested. There is another difference that has made jails a rich source of stories for "lockup." 

[00:02:01]


>> Unlike a prison where most of the population comes from across the state, in jail, most of the offenders come from the local area. They know each other. They reflect the personality of the city itself and no better example of that is when we filmed inside suffolk county jail, boston, massachusetts. 
>> [ Bleep ] 
>> he's boston. Get familiar. Don't get it twisted. He's boston in this. 
>> In boston it was almost like we got to learn the lay of the land because people talk so much about the different neighborhoods in the area they were from. Everyone in boston was proud of their neighborhood and different represents it once they were inside and kind of stuck to the people that they knew from their neighborhoods inside. 
>> I'm boston. He's boston. Not dorchester, charlestown. East boston. 
>> Do you know -- 
>> how many movies have they made on east boston? 
>> Listen, you know the movie "the rat." Whitey bulger. 
[ Bleep ]. That's the claim to fame. 
>> No, he ain't! 
>> Yes, sir, that's all he's got. That's all he's got. 
>> They're from chelsea. 
>> You live in chelsea? 
>> See you later. 
>> I'm out of here. 
>> The inmates in boston shared more than neighborhood pride. They also knew how to throw a punch. 
>> Every day. We respond to fights every day, sometimes they're one-on-one fights, sometimes multiple detainees are involved. 
>> Got hit with a tread. 
>> He beat the [ bleep ] out of me. 
>> We just stomped him. 
>> On numerous occasions, the "lockup" production team would be in the middle of an interview when a fight call would come over a deputy's radio. 

[00:04:02]


>> However, we've had him down. Got to go. Be right back. Right back. Got to run. 
>> You guys must do a lot of running if you're looking at fights. 
>> We just break the camera off the tripod, grab the boom as much as we can as quickly as possible and we head off to see what's going on. 
>> Lock in, guys. Lock in now. 
>> We told the stories behind several of the fights that broke out in boston during our "extended stay" series. But there were others, as well. One involved two haitian immigrants who had known each other outside of jail. 
[ Bleep ] one of them was frank jules. 
>> What happened, sir? 
>> I don't know. People come to me and fight me. I don't know what it is. He just kept fight me. I not see his face. He drop me on the floor. This is -- this is not right. I want to see him first. I don't know -- I don't fight him back. He keep fight me. I don't know who this is. 
>> Jules told the responding deputies that he was attacked by surprise and did nothing to provoke the fight. Later, captain michael caldwell reviewed jail surveillance footage and confirmed jules' account. 
>> And what you'll notice, this gentleman mr. Jean baptiste is just coming into view, and it's an unprovoked attack on mr. Jules. Mr. Jules, from our perspective, and from the officers' observation, never fought back to defend himself. Detainee jules did not see the attack coming. And you can see that mr. Jean baptiste really manhandles him for quite some time, actually launching a flying kick there. 
>> I never do nothing to you. Why would you just come to beat me and take me, drop me on the floor like that. Like someone who you're trying to kill me, right? So why? My neck, I can't move it. And now I feel headache. I feel headache. And then keep -- 

[00:06:25]


>> while jules said the attack was unprovoked jean baptiste told jail officials he was acting on a long-held grudge from the streets. 
>> Inmate jean baptiste blamed inmate jules for his previous incarceration. I don't know what happened on the street between them but he blamed everything on inmate jules. Apparently he's been waiting two years to get his hands on him. 
>> Both inmates went to the seg unit. Inmate jules was found not guilty, and he was released from the seg unit and put back in population the next day. Inmate jean baptiste served 20 days in seg for that particular fight. 
>> I kind of feel good now, you know what I'm saying? I'm not going to lie. I feel good. 
>> So it's over? 
>> Yeah. 
>> It's done? 
>> It's done. 
>> What if he retaliates? 
>> I just hope he don't try and get at me. I'm good. 
>> Okay. 
>> You thought it was over, huh? You thought it was over. 
>> Nearly every fight will have two different perspectives and getting a complete picture of what happened poses a challenge for deputies. In the shower. In the shower. 
>> On the ground. 
>> An attack in the shower between inmates adidas maston and brad flowers proved to be no exception. 
>> Slow everybody down. We have two restraints. 
>>> Coming up -- 
>> he cut you? 
>> Yeah. 
>> Where? 
>> Above my eye. 
>> Suffolk county deputies attempt to unravel the fight between maston and flowers. And another boston inmate shares jailhouse superstitions. 
>> I don't write my name anywhere in the jail because if you write your name in the jail, you're going to come back. I don't wanna be right ??????

>>> We'll hear a radio call. They usually have distinct signals when a disturbance breaks out and we just go. We don't have any idea how it's going to play out. It could be over by the time we get there, it could still be going on but we have to respond. Most of the time we encounter the responding officers and in that case we follow in close behind and let the story unfold. 
>> During our weeks of shooting, "lockup: Extended stay" in boston's suffolk county jail, we often trailed deputies as they responded to a multitude of inmate fights. 
>> Other hand. Slow everybody down. 

[00:12:08]


>> Don't move. 
>> Take him into his cell. 
>> Stop running your mouth. 
>> Okay? 
[ Bleep ] 
>> what was that all about? 
>> I didn't even swing. 
>> What was that all about? 
>> Basketball target. 
>> This fight was between inmates brad flowers and adidas maston. It occurred in the shower area, out of view of the jail's hundreds of surveillance cameras. 
>> Turn around. Put your hands through the trap. 
>> Lieutenant keith maderus, one of the first officers on the scene, did seeomething important. 
>> I observed inmate mastons throwing closest punches and exchanging closest punches with inmate flowers. During the restraint he did drop a metallic object which was identified as a nail clipper which we believe was being used as a weapon. 
>> Most inmates will get 10 to 15 days in segregation for fighting. But the sanctions could be more severe if a weapon was involved. In this case, flowers seem to suffer the worst of the fight with a thin cut over his left eye. 
>> Nine, please. 
>> Lieutenant maderus will question both men to determine what happened. He starts with maston who sayu the incident actually didn't start in the shower, but earlier in the gym. 
>> What was that all about? 
>> Over a game in the gym. 
>> A game this the gym? What happened? 
>> Nothing. He was losing and I got hit so started swinging and that's it. 
>> So the basketball game got a little rough? 
>> Mm-hmm. 
>> You started talking smack to each other? Disrespect each other or something? 
>> Yep. 
>> So you just went back and decided to handle it? 
>> Hum. 
>> Who was in the shower? 
>> Just me and him. 
>> Who was in the shower first? 
>> He was. 
>> What about the metal I found on you? 
>> You can check my radio. You can see there's no blood on it. Nothing at all. You can check me. 

[00:14:09]


>> He's got a cut over his right eye. He says you cut him with a weapon. 
>> You can check it out. 
>> I'm just letting you know. 
>> Okay. 
>> Mm-hmm. 
>> Close 9, please. 7, please. 
>> Lieutenant maderus will now hear the other sid the story from mr. Flowers. 
>> Mr. Flowers, what happened? What was that all about? 
>> Argument. 
>> An argument. 
>> Yeah. 
>> Where did the argument start? 
>> In the gym. 
>> In the gym? 
>> Uh-huh. 
>> You guys had gym this morning? 
>> Uh-huh. 
>> Okay. And then what happened? Came back to the unit and what? 
>> When I was getting out of the shower, he snuck in, tried to cut my face. 
>> Did he cut you? 
>> Yeah. 
>> Where at? 
>> Above my eye. My left eye. 
>> Your left eye, right? You have been up there with him for a while. Why is this popping off today? 
>> There's been some indirect 
[ bleep ], you know what I'm saying, like [ bleep ]. We was in the gym and I guess one thing led to another. I guess he snubbed me. 
>> Yeah? Nothing happened in the gym? 
>> Arguing. 
>> Don't lie to me. Something happen in the gym between the two of you guys? Fighting behind the curtain? Be straight with me because you know I'm going to look at the cameras. 
>> It was no [ bleep ] 
>> listen were you fighting in the gym? 
>> Nothing happened in the gym but words. I was just saying [ bleep ] to him. 
>> Okay. So you guys had words -- 
>> I offered him to fight me in the gym. 
>> But he didn't? 
>> He didn't want to fight me in the gym. 
>> I appreciate you cooperating with me. 
>> One of the hardest parts of the officer's job is to get information out of the inmates after a fight, or any kind of situation occurs where disciplinary reports are being written up. It's kind of a rule of thumb for inmates not to talk to the staff about anything really. You know, you don't want to be labeled a snitch. No one wants to be seen that they're working with the cops. 
>> With neither inmate providing details the jail gave both men time in the confinement unit. While many inmates in boston settle disputes with their fists, there are other stories to be told there as well. 

[00:16:12]


>> When we produce one of our "extended stay" series for "lockup," our crew will be in a prison or a jail for up to 50 days in order for us to produce six episodes. They will interview more than 100 inmates and maybe 20 or so will actually make it on the air and then sometimes we meet an inmate who plays a very small role in somebody else's story and they just appear in the show ever so briefly. But those inmates have stories to tell as well. And one of the advantages of "lockup: Raw" is that we get to tell those stories. 
>> During the boston series, we told the story of melissa allen, and how her struggles with drugs led to a host of problems for her and her family. 
>> All this is the dirty work. Walk the street, sell drugs, do all that. A couple streets down, that's where I live. And they've put me in a room i can see everything I did. 
>> But inside suffolk county, melissa was striving to improve her life, in part, by studying for her g.E.D. That's how we met megan douly. She was voluntarily tutoring melissa. 
>> Ten times number? You add a zero to a number. 10. 30, 40, 50, 60 -- 
>> yes. Easy. 
>> She doesn't know the multiplication tables. I do. That's something iled in when I was in school. I have a job as a bookkeeper and everything else. So math is one of my better skills, you know. 
>> When we asked megan about why she wanted to help melissa with her schoolwork she had told us it was because of her father. He influenced her to want to help people and do good and she was able to find a way to do that inside the jail. 
>> He was sober for 18 months when he died and I used to just watch him at meetings and stuff and young guys would come in wanting to go to a detox and my father would be the first person to say, I'll give you a ride. No questions asked. Not even knowing them, just to help them out. And he always told me, if you can't help somebody, don't hurt them. And treat people how you want to be treated. That's one thing that my father instilled in me before he passed away. 

[00:18:30]


>> I don't know what it is, honey. I have no idea. 
>> Like her father, megan had struggled with her own addictions. Her use of heroin had led to several jail stays. On minor convictions ranging from sex for a fee to disturbing the peace. But this time, the stakes were more serious. She was awaiting trial on five drug possession charges, as well as being co-defendant on an armed robbery charge. She had pled not guilty to all six charges. 
>> What kind of book am i looking at right now? 
>> Megan was due in court the next day and was doing everything possible to not tempt fate. In the process, we learned something about jailhouse superstitions. 
>> I won't start a new book if i know I'm going to court or getting out, without having enough time to finish it. Because I feel like if I leave a book unfinished, I'll come back to finish it. I just have superstitions. I don't write my name anywhere in the jail because if you write your name in the jail, you're going to come back. It's just different things. If an officer drops keys in front of you, that means you're going home. Last time I went to bail review, the officer dropped keys in front of me. But I didn't go home, so I guess that one doesn't work. Anything that I was wearing when I got arrested, I throw away and don't wear it again. 
>> As it turned out, megan played her cards correctly. The next day in court, her armed robbery charge was lowered to a less serious larceny charge. And even though she was found guilty of that and the drug possession charges, she was released based on the time she had already spent in jail. Whether any officers dropped their keys in front of her, we never found out. 
>>> Coming up -- 
>> all right, no gang affiliation? Never have? 
>> Absolutely not. I go to church. If that counts. 

[00:20:32]


>> Yeah. 
>> Sorting out the new inmates at the orange county jail. 
>> Have you ever tried to hurt yourself before? 
>> Absolutely not. 
>> Are you thinking of hurting yourself right now? 
>> NO, MA'AM.att as part of your heart healthy diet. Step 1. Eat the soup. All those veggies and beans, that's what may help lower your cholesterol and -- Well that's easy 
[ Male Announcer ] Progresso. You gotta taste this soup. gas meltaways, or treat gas with these after you get it. Now that's like sunblock before or sun burn cream later. Oh, somebody out there's saying, now I get it! Take beano before and there'll be no gas. 

[00:23:41]


>>> "Lockup" field teams encounter unexpected situations on a regular basis. 
>> You think I'm stupid? 
>> From vicious attacks -- 
>> I've got a knife. 
>> Don't step in the blood. 
>> To heartbreaking visits. 
>> My daddy. 
>> Life behind bars can be an emotional roller coaster but it's when we shoot inside county jails that we get a look at where the ride begins. 
>> Get off of me. 
>> Relax. 
>> Chill out. 
>> [ Bleep ] you. 
>> Virtually every inmate's first incarceration is at a jail, as opposed to a prison. And the booking department is where the reality of being a number, rather than a name, sinks in. 
>> Line up on your right side make two lines. Stop talking. Pants off your legs, above your knees. Let me see your stomach. Put it down. 
>> We encountered robert as he was being booked into the orange county jail in southern california. All the way over. 
>> Okay. Go ahead and get dressed again. Put all your stuff back on. 
>> He was brought in after failing to complete community service for a prior conviction of disturbing the peace. The result of a bar fight. Since his community service was in lieu of a five-day jail sentence, he will now have to serve some of that time, and this will be his first full night of incarceration. 
>> I'm a little nervous. Ver done it before. Don't know what to expect, you know. Just trying to keep by myself. Keep peace. Not trying to get into arguments with anybody. Not trying to fight with anybody. You know what I mean. I want to be able to do my time and that's it. 
>> You look like you're getting a little emotional. 
>> Yeah. 
>> From here on in, corley's every step is controlled by jail deputies. 
>> Put your back against the wall for me. Look up at the here camera for me and I'll take your picture next. These papers are yours to keep. Walk on the lines to the right and stop on the red "x" in front of number 8 over there. 

[00:25:48]


>> The booking process examines corley's emotional well-being. 
>> Have you ever tried to hurt yourself before? 
>> Absolutely not. 
>> Are you thinking about trying to hurt yourself now? No, ma'am. 
>> As well as his physical well-being. 
>> They have an x-ray to check for tuberculosis. Every inmate goes through that process. After that they go through a livescan machine, it's fingerprinting. 
>> Right now we're taking electronic fingerprints that goes into a national database system. It allows us to sitively identify the individual. 
>> And after that step they'll get classified with our classification deputies to determine what type of level inmate they are. 
>> No gang affiliations of any kind? 
>> Never have. 
>> Absolutely not. I go to church. If that counts. 
>> Yeah. 
>> Are you homosexual or straight? 
>> Straight. 
>> Tattoos? 
>> Yes, sir. 
>> What have you got? Go ahead and take your shirt off for me. 
>> The jail also documents tattoos for identification purposes and to determine if the inmate might have gang affiliations. 
>> What is that? A heart? 
>> Yeah. It says sabrina. 
>> Just not done yet? 
>> No, sir. 
>> What's up with the six-shooter. You a cowboy? 
>> Yes, sir, I was born in missouri. 
>> All right. That's what it's for? 
>> Yes, sir. I'm all into old western. 
>> Nothing else though? 
>> A girl's face on the back of my right leg. And that's it. 
>> Golly, just keeps coming. Calf? On your right calf? 
>> Yes. 
>> Nothing in your hairlines or anything like that? 
>> No. On my lip I have my initials. 
>> Damn. 
>> R.C. 
>> R.C.? What is that in the middle? What's that in the middle? 
>> It was supposed to say robby but it didn't come out right. 
>> Were you drunk? Or what? 
>> No. 
>> You did that sober? 
>> Yes, sir. 
>> All right. All right, let me see your left hand. This is the last time I'm going to see you, right? 
>> Yes, sir. 
>> Corley's tattoos are determined not to be gang affiliated. And he's cleared for a less restrictive general population housing unit. 
>> All right, man. You're good to go. 

[00:27:51]


>> Thank you, sir. 
>> I.D. Pickup. 
>> But first corley will experience one more sobering step. Exchanging his street clothes for jail scrubs and plastic sandals. 
>> Let's see what this says. It says we're taking away your freedom right here. 
>> Keep going. Corley will wait in a holding cell with other new inmates until his housing assignment is finalized. While corley's booking process was routine, many others are emotionally overwhelmed on their first day in jail. 
>> I'm in the orange county jail. I'm in a room with no windows, NO NOTHING.er it was homemade. Everyone tells a little white lie now and then. But now she wants my recipe 
[ clears his throat ] [ softly ] She's right behind me isn't she? 
[ Male Announcer ] Progresso. You gotta taste this soup. 

[00:32:27]


>>> Due to mature subject matter, viewer discretion is advised. 
>> You've got to tell me where to go. 
>> You've never been to jail before? 
>> No, I haven't. 
>> I believe that one. 
>> Nearly every inmate who's done time in state prison has first spent time inside a county jail. 
>> Spread your feet apart. 
>> And it's a terrifying experience, especially for first-time offenders. During intake we have hundreds of inmates coming through. You could have a murderer next to a guy who is in for shoplifting. On our first day of filming "extended stay" inside orange county jail in california, we covered the trauma of a young man's first day in jail. 
>> I'm in the orange county jail. I'm like in a room with no windows, no nothing. Nobody -- I don't know what's going on. I don't know. 
>> When we met 20-year-old richard ruiz, he had already completed the booking process and his first court arraignment and was now engaged in another jailhouse ritual, the first call home. 
>> So I'm just sitting in a room. I don't know if it's light or daylight. I lose track of time. I get woken up by all of the slamming doors and stuff. Like I don't know what's going on in here. I skip all meals because I don't want to eat. 
>> Ruiz had been arrested 48 hours earlier for the first time in his life, charged with intent to sell narcotics. He hoped his father would be able and willing to bail him out. 
>> It's $2500. 10% of $25,000 bail. Thank you, dad. All right. Yep. I love you. Bye. He doesn't deserve a phone call from here. But it's all my fault that I'm here. It's no one's fault but myself. 

[00:34:41]


>> There's a term that people use called a fish and basically if you're a new booking and you've never been in jail before, it's like you can imagine when you take a fish out of water. They're just very disoriented, they're lost, they don't know what's going on. Luckily they don't flop around. 
>> Honestly, there's probably about $80 worth of pills in my car and it's not worth this. 
>> What are you thinking about? 
>> There's so much more than this. Just to know that you're stuck somewhere and you have no clue what's going on. In a 10 foot by 10 foot room with no windows. Not knowing if it's dark, light outside, it's nothing to look forward to. 
>> He's a new booking. He's somebody with no criminal experience. He hasn't been here before and then he's been removed from general population so he has nobody to talk to. He can't communicate with anybody. So of course he is scared. 
>> Ruiz had been segregated from other inmates due to the jewelry implants in his face. 
>> They're called dermal implants. Pretty much what they do is they get a needle, they make a pocket in your face, they push around to make it hollow and they put a plate inside the slit. 
>> Because those piercings, according to him, are irremovable, we don't know that and we don't know what those piercings are capable, once they're taken out they could contain contraband. They could be used as a weapon, could be against himself, against staff or even fellow inmates. 
>> I have another one on the back of my neck. It's called a surface staple. As you can see, there's a bar through my neck and there's two flat head screwdriver parts to it. 
>> Basically, for mr. Ruiz, for him it's been a good thing being isolated because he won't be exposed to a general population setting. He won't be exposed to gang politics. He won't be exposed to inmate pressures. So for mr. Ruiz, it might have been a saving grace for him that he actually had piercings and that he was removed from general population so he doesn't have to answer any of those questions. 

[00:36:54]


>> Well, as you know, I'm from orange county jail. 
>> Just hours before he would answer to the judge. Ruiz used his time in isolation to write a letter to his girlfriend who he had not spoken to since his arrest. 
>> Baby I'm sorry for not picking you up at work. I was in a police car at the time. I hope you're there when I get out. The only thing I can dream or think about is all the right things I'm going to do when i get out. This is too hard for me right now. To be continued. 
>> Okay. We're back in session, back on the record. On case number 10-sf-0604, people versus richard edward ruiz. Mr. Ruiz is richard edward ruiz jr. Your true name? 
>> Yes. 
>> The following day it's preliminary court hearing ruiz was charged with felony possession of narcotics which could carry a lengthy sentence behind bars. He entered a plea of not guilty and had one supporter at the hearing, his girlfriend, samantha dunn, who spoke to us afterwards. 
>> Tell me how you found out that your boyfriend was in jail. 
>> He was supposed to pick me up from work one day and after work I was waiting outside and an hour had passed and he wasn't there and I knew something was wrong. And so when I got home I found out on the internet that he was arrested. 
>> What are your biggest fears for him right now? 
>> I'm just afraid that he's in isolation, just completely -- you know, scared and lonely and doesn't know what's going to happen. And on top of that, I'm afraid of how long he's going to be in jail. That's my biggest fear so far. And that it would change him in any way. I hope it doesn't change his heart. 
>> I didn't know my girlfriend was going to be in the courtroom. Just knowing, some way, I didn't hurt myself, I hurt people that were close, and just -- they are still supportive. It hurts. 

[00:39:11]


>> The couple would soon be reunited after ruiz posted bond and was releas he pled guilty at a later court hearing and was sentenced to three years probation. 
>> Do you understand that? 
>> Yes. 
>> But the memory of his first experience in jail will likely last a lifetime. 
>> Everybody learns the hard way. This is my first time learning. 
>>> Coming up -- 
>> I've accepted the fact that a potential outcome of trial could be the death sentence. 
>> We encounter an iraq war veteran accused of murder inside phoenix's maricopa county jail. Wow. It's the honey, it makes it taste so... Well, would you look at the time... What's the rush? Be happy. Be healthy. decisions. Like gas station sushi. Or super cheap car insurance. And then there are good decisions. Like esurance. Their coverage counselor helps you choose the right coverage for you at a great price. 
[ sch growls ] Esurance. Now backed by allstate. Click or call. 

[00:43:00]


>>> A key difference between shooting in jail and prison is that in prison inmates know their fate. 
>> Come get me out. For real. 
>> They have pled or been found guilty. And with few exceptions, they know their sentences won't change. 
>> Put your hands on the fence. 
>> In jail, most of the inmates are still awaiting a trial. Their futures are in the hands of lawyers, judges and juries. Such was the case with clark fish, who we met at the maricopa county jail in phoenix, arizona, while he was awaiting trial for murder. 
>> As a producer, it's challenging to find your characters and to find the important stories in a place like maricopa county with 9,000 inmates. So you're always looking for reasons to talk to people or things that might be interesting. In the case of clark fish, i came across him in a very, very unique way. I was walking past his cell and I saw how his socks had been folded and his socks had been rolled up in a ball with these little smiles. And as a veteran, I knew that's exactly how you folded -- were trained to fold your socks in the military. And so I said, were you in the service? And he goes, yeah, I was in the army. 
>> I joined the army straight out of high school. It was a conviction of mine because we as a family, a lot of males in the family, have been part of the service. And so I felt it was my obligation, and I was a health care specialist. I had no idea what it meant to be a health care specialist. All I knew is I wanted to do something medical. And I want to work in a hospital with doctors so they told me I'd be doing that. The reality was, I was not a health care specialist but a pretty name for combat medic. 
>> One of the challenges is always getting the inmates to share some very intimate details of their lives, and sometimes their crimes. I think in clark's case, the fact that I was a veteran and the fact that he was a veteran really created a bond between us, and he felt comfortable talking to me. 

[00:45:10]


>> Fish went on to discuss the fear he felt when he was deployed to iraq not long after joining the army. 
>> I didn't want to ecause i didn't want to die. I was too afraid of dying. But also I felt like I had been jilted with the whole health care specialist, it sounded real pretty. 
>> Prior to his deployment, fish requested a discharge and was denied. So he went awol. He was eventually caught and did time in a military jail. 
>> While I was in jail I had time to think and I said, this doesn't become me or my family to be sitting here in jail, I'm too afraidgo to iraq. I said my dad was in vietnam. I can do this, too. So I decided, I'm going to do it. And so that was my second chance. So they sent me to iraq. 
>> In iraq, fish was assigned to an air force base hospital where wounded soldiers arrived daily. 
>> The only thing I remember specifically is the first guy i treated, he's dead now. And he was a marine. He came in and his arm was damaged. It was totally wrapped up. They're sticking needles and stuff in him and doing procedures om and I'm helping the nurses as much as i can there. And then the nurse says, hey, if you want to do something for him right now, hold his hand because this is really going to hurt him. The last thing I remember doing is holding his hand for him and he -- and in the throes of his pain, gripped my hand. He was alive enough to feel the extreme amount of pain. But he wasn't able to scream or voice it, and then he got evacuated and died on the way to the hospital in germany. 
>> Ais tour ended, fish returned to the united states. During a random military drug test, he came up positive for marijuana and was released with an "other than honorable" discharge. Soon after, fish says he suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder. 
>> They put me on medications for it. You start smelling things that you used to smell over there and you start kind of seeing things and you hear an alarm or something and it will trigger something in your mind that puts you into a panic mode like you were over there. 

[00:47:19]


>> After his discharge, fish moved back home and got a job at a veterinary clinic. He began to date one of the female doctors who worked there. 
>> Part of the reason that clark was believable is that he seemed to be pretty cdid about some of the less flattering aspects of his relationship. He admitted that he was in an abusive relationship. He admitted that he had hit her many times. 
>> But authorities say that one night the abuse led to murder. Fish admits he and his girlfriend had been fighting. He says everything had calmed down by the time they went to bed. 
>> I went to sleep, I passed out. I remember putting my head on the pillow, closing my eyes, i woke up in the same exact position I fell asleep in. I know that. I said, beth, we got to get up. And I shook her hand, and when i shook her hand, her hand was just stiff and ridged with rigor mortis, and it was cold. It just had a waxy feeling. I called my dad and my dad ca the police. When the police came, I told them the truth. I told them everything I knew. 
>> The cause of death was eventually ruled asphyxiation due to strangulation and fish was arrested. 
>> I've accepted the fact that a potential outcome of trial is a guilty verdict from the jury and also along with that verdict could be a death sentence. 
>> Fish stood trial several weeks after we left maricopa. 
>> You know, when you meet clark, he's a very likeable guy. He's intelligent, he's affable. Everybody likes clark. So you want to believe his version. You want to believe his narrative. But in the end, a jury of 12, reasonable people found that he was guilty of murdering his girlfriend. 
>> Several months after our shoot at maricopa, fish received his sentence. Though he was eligible for the death penalty, he was given life without the possibility of parole. And has made the permanent move from the maricopa county jail to the arizona state prison system. 

[00:49:29]


>>> Coming up -- 
>> stop talking. Close that new york mouth for a minute. 
>> We meet a no-nonsense sergeant who makes a big impression on jail inmates in tampa, florida. 
>> You give my deputy a hard time, we going to run it MILITARY-STYLE STRICT. how does it work? You just have to eat it as part of your heart healthy diet. Step 1. Eat the soup. All those veggies and beans, that's what may help lower your cholesterol and -- Well that's easy 
[ Male Announcer ] Progresso. You gotta taste this soup. flo? is? Are you flo? Yes. Is this the thing you gave my husband? Well, yeah, yes. The "name your price" tool. You tell us the price you want to pay, and we give you a range of options to choose from. Careful, though -- that kind of power can go to your head. That explains a lot. Yo, buddy! I got this. Gimme one, gimme one, gimme one! The power of the "name your price" tool. Only from progressiv 

[00:52:59]


>>> over the years, we have met a number of memorable men and women who work in the nation's prisons and jails. 
>> Just square yourself away. Check yourself. Knock this off. 
>> Those who stand out the most usually do so because of their straightforward dealings with inmates. 
>> If you ever going to make it, you're going to have to learn to swallow your pride and learn to take a back seat sometime. Those are things that you're going to have to learn if you're going to make it. You've got to learn that. 
>> Long-time viewers will immediately recognize warden grant culliver as one of the more memorable personalities to ever appear on "lockup." He took a personal interest in all his inmates. But wasn't hesitant to unleash when he felt it was necessary. 
>> I'm trying to talk to you. 
>> You tell me -- you tell me that you would be -- 
>> if you would shut the 
[ bleep ] up, then I could understand why we're so pissed off with [ bleep ] you're acting like a child! 
>> Since our last visit to holman, warden culliver has left the prison. He was promoted to associate commissioner with the alabama department of corrections. But when we traveled to the hillsborough county jail in tampa, florida, we met sergeant sarah herman, who seemed to be cast from the same mold. 
>> You tearing up my property? One-way trip to charlie, dude, and you're never coming out. Quiet. Stop talking. You don't tell her what to do. Close that new york mouth for a minute. Jackson, I don't forget something. Don't waste my time. How long you been here? Okay. Don't underestimate miss herman. 
>> Like warden culliver, sergeant herman was known for being both tough, and compassionate. 
>> Have you been drinking any water? Come and get a cup and start drinking some water for me, okay? Sometimes when you're sick like that and you're not hydrated, it messes with your mind. 

[00:55:04]


>> When sergeant herman would walk into a unit, it was almost as if, you know, a sergeant in the army or something was walking into a barracks. People really, they understood that she was coming in, she meant business. 
>> Attitudes in this pod cease from this moment going forward unless you want to be on 72-hour lock, that means no coming or going. Visitation, phone calls will be shut down. If you give my deputy a hard time, we going to run it military-style strict. 
>> After serving four years in the army, sergeant herman had a career as a media marketing executive. Shortly after 9/11, she came to work for the hillsborough county sheriff's office in a quest to find more meaning in her life. 
>> Know this and know it really good, okay? I do not play. 
>> She says she has found it working with inmates. 
>> If you could just touch one with an encouraging word, that makes all the difference. These are our neighbors. This is my community. I live here. A lot of them do see me out at walmart or at the mall and the first thing they want to do is come up and give you a hug and say, that thing that you did, you know, that's what kind of is the reward. That's what you see when you say, okay, this isn't working or this is just a job. No, it's more than just a job. Stand by the door. I'm not here to judge them. That's something I do not do. And I try to think positive and display that type of attitude with them as well because a lot of them do not come from a world where they have people speaking positive for them. 
>> Ma'am? 
>> Come in here. 
>> We captured one such example when sergeant herman was meeting with inmate sonia whose drug use on the street had recently brought her back to jail on her third parole violation. 
>> Tell me something, what is going to keep you, other than your kids, from not coming here again? 
>> My plan is actually to complete my g.E.D., Finish school, and find me a job to keep myself busy and occupied. 

[00:57:14]


>> Each day you have to choose and decide what is sonia going to do today. If it doesn't feel right and you know in your gut it's wrong, leave. Run. So that was my word for you today. I'm happy to see that you've got your mind set on doing the right thing. 
>> Yes. I thank you and I appreciate it. 
>> You're welcome. 
>> Thanks. 
>> When we were filming the exchange between sonia and sergeant herman, I couldn't help but to think that sergeant herman was actually getting through to her. But as soon as she left, the other side of sonia emerged. 
>> Make sure you don't come in here anymore. 
>> Yes, ma'am. 
>> I don't want to see you in here anymore. 
>> Yes, ma'am. Thank you. 
>> All right, bye. 
>> Bye. 
>> As we were placing her back in her pod, I don't know if she was just doing it for show for the other inmates but her comment as I close the door and secure it she says I'm going home and I'm going to smoke a blunt. It makes me very upset. And she knows that I heard her. And she knows that I will probably say something to her a little bit later. Was that just a show, or are you just -- are you serious? We'll have to see. You just never know what's going to happen and judging by her history, the odds are stacked against her. 
>> Please raise your right hand. Swear to tell the truth and nothing but the truth so hel you god? 
>> And sgeant herman's assessment proved accurate. After hearing of her third parole violation, the judge in her case had had enough. And sent kuerez to state prison in order to complete her six-year sentence. And while change might not have come soon enough for her, a significant change came for sergeant herman. She took a five-week leave during the course of our shoot and explained why when she returned. 
>> I opted to do a lat band surgery so I took a l]ave of absence for about five weeks to get that implanted and done and recoup and come back to work. I may be talking the talk, but I'm overweight and not walking the walk. That's not right. And I'm a field training officer. How am I going to look for new people who are coming in the door, they're all fit and healthy and can outrun me. And I'm the one that's in charge. I think that's a little backwards. Miss me? 

[00:59:24]


>> Though her physical appearance had changed, we quickly discovered that sergeant herman had not lost a step when it came to her no nonsense attitude with inmates. 
>> You are qualifying every freakin' thing that comes out your mouth with an excuse, which means you're not owning it. Accept it for what it is. That's a part of wou are. Until you decide to change it. You have to change it.

>> While many inmates are eager to share their stories or talents with us -- delshaun bloodworth, an inmate at boston suffolk county jail took things to another level. 
>> You know I'm about ready to get ready for my video shoot and about my show my biceps and abs and [ bleep ] and about to be wavy. 
>> Dell delshaun caught our attention right away >> I'm going to show you that in a minute. 
>> He saw it as an opportunity to showcase himself. And he was concerned about how he was coming across to the viewers. 
>> Do I look good? 
>> You look fine. 
>> My hair look good? 
>> Do you see all my features? I did it with the razor. 
>> I want to be famous. I want to be someone that everyone remembers. I want to be not just a locally famous. I want to be internationally famous across the world. I want -- 
>> for what? 
>> For rapping. 
>> I run this city with an iron fist you going against it I'm going to have to break your wrist. I can't have you shooting at my team. That's a big no no. Teachers told me sit down I was like police say freeze I was like because I'm always in that rebel state of mind I be posting on lawmen I ain't that hard to find. Watch how easily and chewing up this time. I be moving on these kids. I don't do it for the shine. Damn I forgot the part. 
>> That was good. 
>> That was good. 
>> He didn't just rap about a life of crime he came to jail on charges of armed robbery and assault and battery. 
>> They say after we took the guy's money allegedly that i punched him in his face, thinking I was going to beat my charge. I was wrong and I'm still in jail ever since. 

[00:04:14]


>> Both these guys are coming out right? 
>> Yeah. 
>> Bloodworth's stay at suffolk county was also marked by violence. He and his cell mate were both in the segregation unit after they attacked another inmate. 
>> You guys feeling like a real criminal here. 
>> And on the first day we met bloodworth he decided to put on another display of violence. Though cuffed and shackled for his one hour recreation time per day, bloodworth attacked another inmate as we followed b]hind. 
>> Usually when you're filming an inmate they're a little more cautious about what they're doing because they know they're on camera. This was blatant. This was right in front of us. It happened right there. He knew he was being filmed at the time he started this fight. 
>> Central control we have two restrained -- 
>> you thought it was over, huh? You thought it was over. 
[ Bleep ] 
>> we later learned that this fight was the result of a dispute that followed bloodworth from the streets into the jail. 
>> Delshaun bloodworth has a distinction of trying to switch his gang affiliations. He was in a constant battle with different feuds and he is fighting the friends with the old neighborhood. That is his problem right now. 
>> If you are jumping in a gang and you don't know that these things are a part of the gangster package you shouldn't be in it, simple as that. 
>> Basically if I'm getting this straight you made a decision to live your life in a perpetual war that has no end in sight and that's okay? 
>> I never said it was okay. You know what I mean. I don't feel it's okay. But will I sit back and allow them to always be on offense coming at us all the time? No. I'm going to put them on defense which means I will be running through your hood and I will be letting that thing go. They want to white flag it, we can do that. But on this side we never white flag it. 

[00:06:34]


>> Bloodworth was put in a single man cell following the latest attack, and for all of his bravado, our next visit revealed some of his fears and not just any ordinary fears. 
>> Hopefully the world don't blow up because I don't want to die in here. 2012 the world might end. The world might end. You don't believe that? 
>> You're going to reference the mayan calendar? 
>> The mayan calendar, yes. Socrates said it himself. I just find it funny that all the philosophers point to 2012 as it blowing up. Boom! That's it. It's over. I want to get a [ bleep ] before I die and I want to smoke a blunt and get a cigarette. You know what I mean? I don't want to be with a bunch of dudes. 
>> It would be another month before our next check in with bloodworth. It was clear he had missed the attention. 
>> Tracy. What's up? You are going to swerve and not say nothing? 
>> I was going to say bye. 
>> The most unusual thing is the way he would interact with us. He was interested in us coming up to his door. 
>> You be on some funny

>> You see? I thought I was the main cojones. I got the get my face on. 
>> I thought I was the main person. Me right there. Everybody else is just -- 
>> like what? Lockup boston delshaun. 
>> Yeah. No bull. It's funny because I was really thinking that. It's crazy. 
>> Coming up -- 
>> that doesn't make he look good. 
>> Delshaun bloodworth is caught in a lie. And --

>> And experiencing lockup with our field team. 
>> If you get lackadaisical about it, salesmen something can really happen.When I started losing energy and became moody... That's when I had an honest conversation with my doctor.

>>> During our extended stay shoot at the suffolk county jail in boston, delshaun bloodworth warmed up to the cameras. 
>> Working with what I got. It's all I got. 
>> And seemed determined to make a lasting impression on us. 
>> All right. All right. 
>> We were also with bloodworth when his life reached a major turning point. He accepted a plea deal on his armed robbery and battery charges and sentenced to two and a half years. We followed him from the suffolk county jail facility for pre-trial detainees to the nearby house of correction where he would serve his sentence. 
>> Got to school these young boys about the television business. 
>> Our next interview with bloodworth was more serious. He had told us earlier that the victim of his crime was a man but later we discovered that wasn't true. 
>> The police blotter on your charges said you robbed a woman. What was the deal? 
>> That don't look good. Makes me look like a sucker. When you hear someone robbed a female, they say really? You're that much of a coward you have to rob a woman. I'm ashamed of robbing a female. 
>> After the robbery bloodworth and his accomplice were quickly apprehended. But for bloodworth, the arresting officer added the ultimate insult. 
>> Step on my shoe my new all white adidas. I was mad. I was mad. It was fresh. 
>> You robbed someone with a gun and you were mad because a policeman stepped on your new tennis shoe? I just want to make sure -- 
>> yeah, you right. But you know -- I like to give punishment, I don't like to receive it. 
>> The final interview with bloodworth ended with a revealing exchange. 
>> Do you think you deserve to be in here? 
>> No. I don't think I deserve to be in here. 
>> What do you think you would be doing if you were out on the street right now? 
>> The same thing. 
>> You don't think you should be in here? 

[00:13:56]


>> I don't think I should the people the law-abiding citizens do who don't want to get robbed. It's a cold world. It's a cold world. I need money, you have it. The way I get it is by robbing you. I'm saying I know it's wrong and what's right. You know what I mean. I'm not dumb. 
>> You're not that's what I am giving you such a hard time. You're very far from dumb. 
>> You know I just -- it's just -- it's plenty of ways to make money, you know? But that's the way I just chose how to make it. 
>> You don't have to do it by making the world a colder place. That's all I'm saying delshaun. That's all I'm saying. 
>> You know I think if I was to go out to, to let's say one of the supermarket -- not supermarkets, one of tl stores or something like that, as soon as I get out I don't think they're going to hire me. 
>> I think you should work where they don't have cash registers. That's what I would suggest. 
>> What would you suggest? 
>> Take responsibility is what i would suggest. You have to own what you do. 
>> I own a gun and I own robbing people. 
>> All right. Have I given you enough grief for the day? 
>> No but if you all want to leave, bye. You all look like you're tired of me. You all getting tired of me. I can tell. 
>> No we're not because we haven't been around for a while? 
>> That too. 
>> We have 20 other people we are following. I think you are taking it a little personally. 
>> Bloodworth's interview where a serious moment suddenly turns humorous. 
>> Look at that stance. Get a shot of that stance. 
>> Is not uncommon. 
>> That is steady. 
>> One of the things I love about watching the raw footage come in from the field are the kind of twists and turns these interviews take. Our producers are talking to these inmates about usual hi some serious topics, sensitive topics. And inevitably there will come a time where the producer and the inmate are laughing. Some humorous topic came up in the middle of one of these interviews. And I think it's a testament to our field teams that they're able to get these intimate, personal interviews in an extreme environment like prison. 

[00:16:32]


>> Do you mind being on tv? 
>> No I want to be on tv. 
>> I have to get your signatures and take a quick polaroid. Try to do this in an orderly fashion. 
>> I'm second. 
>> I love your show. 
>> Not only are there the rules that the prison or jail gives you but there are the rules i have grown accustomed to live by while I'm in a facility. And one is never become too comfortable. You are in a prison or a jail. 
>> Are you nervous at all sir? 
>> I do this all the time. 
>> Let me give my picture first. 
>> You all will get a chance. Don't worry. 
>> Can we throw a gang sign? 
>> Can we throw a gang sign? 
>> No. It's good. 
>> What's up? 
>> Yeah, yeah, that's different. That's for the big camera. That's what this is for. 
>> You can't forget that. If you get lackadaisical about it then something could really happen. 
>> I got a little superstitious and I've been wearing the exact same baseball hat and I figure we've gotten this far safely. Why change-up the program now? So I'm going to wear the same baseball hat until the shoot is over with. 
>> People often ask me and other members of the lockup crew if we've ever been attacked or assaulted, if we've been scared or intimidated. 
>> I've never been scared or felt in danger. Because of the bond that I feel like we have with these inmates and the understanding of why we're there and what we're there to achieve. Having said that, though, I'm not naive. There is always the possibility that something could happen. 
>> We're told we have to prepare for that. But we always have staff around us in the case of doing a one-on-one interview I tend to get fairly close to the person I'm interviewing because it's how I can engage and have communication and always talked to my camera crew that god that something happens i have faith that they as well would step in because they are usually right around me so they might be able to help me quicker than a staff member. 

[00:18:39]


>> But ultimately the crew's safety could come down to the inmate's own code known as the convict code. 
>> There are certain prisons where even when you've established a certain rapport with inmates they've made it very clear to me that if another inmate attacks me they will not come to my aide. That's against the convict code. Other prisons inmates say they will protect me. I have been told they are watching me to make sure nobody hurts me. 
>> In certain high-security housing units lockup field teams are required by the prison to wear stab-proof vests before entering. 
>> The first time I put on a stab vest was in indiana at wabash valley. It was definitely an uneasy feeling knowing I had to wear this to walk on to the unit an that the potential to be stabbed was higher here. It definitely makes you a little more on your toes and a lot more alert of your environment. 
>> We noticed that these vests said lock down. Wile we're here we're going to slowly but surely change every stinkin' one of them. 
>> If I'm required to wear a stab vest I usually just make light of it. I joke around about how it adds ten pounds to me and the color don't go with my outfit. I make it into a joke. 
>> And a sense of humor goes a long way in breaking the ice with many of the inmates featured on lockup. 
>> Coming up the one lockup crew member inmates love to rib. 
>> Sometimes I'll hear people say stuff through their cell, hey fat boy. I have to look at myself, really? 
>> And later previously unseen clips from one of the more memorable inmates we ever met. Alli can help you lose one more by blocking some of the fat you eat.

>>> "Lockup: Extended stay" field teams spend weeks at a time in maximum security prisons throughout the nation. We cover stories that range from horrifying to heart breaking. And sometimes the only way to get through it all. 
>> Ryan, think fast. 
>> Is with a sense of humor. Especially for our director of photography, brian kelly. 
>> This was my former life before I was an expert camera operator. 
>> And he is shooting at the same time. 
>> Look at that finger dexterity. 
>> One of the things that makes this shoot enjoyable. 
>> Amazing. 
>> Wow. 
>> Under some pretty difficult circumstances is the humor. 
>> Take it one day at a time. 
>> And I'll be the first one to admit I get made fun of a lot. And it's okay. I laugh with them. It's almost like a bonding situation. 
>> [ Laughter ] 
>> play that part again just -- one more time about the -- just for this. And look at -- 
>> I like the voice. I like brian's voice coming out of you. 
>> I think it's good. 
>> I like it. 
>> Hey fellas. 
>> Brian's a target for some of the teasing that we get on the inside. 
>> One more thing. I got to ask. 
>> Is that how I sound? 
>> Absolutely. 
>> Yeah. Yeah. 
>> I have to ask the most embarrassing question I can think of but look at susan. 
>> Remember yesterday when your rubbed your face and were deep in thought. Can you do that deep in thought face again? Can you cry on cue? 
>> That's not really what happens just for the record. But sometimes I see a creative angle that I like and I will have them do the same action again, so I get a lot of heat. Could you just do that one more time? Do I really sound like that? Maybe I do. But it's okay. Like I said. I take it. It's no big deal. 
>> Chili cheese fritos. 

[00:25:47]


>> They like to tease back and forth and get a rise out of him or something. 
>> He's making funny fac 
>> sometimes I will hear things like hey fat boy through their cell. 
>> I don't what picture. 
>> And I got to look at myself. Really? 
>> Sometimes there are opportunities for the production team to try their hand at some of the more creative methods inmates use to pass time in prison. Through a technique known as fishing, inmates pass everything from notes to books and snacks by tying them to a string they call a fishing line. They then skillfully drag the item from one cell to another. The more advanced practitioners can fish from one floor to another. 
>> It's a big fish. 
>> Is it a skill that requires a lot of practice. 
>> While the crew was filming i came across I think it was a mouthwash with a fishing line wrapped up around it. I had only heard about fishing at this point. When I saw the line I wanted to try it. I asked the co if it was okay for me to try to fish. So they said sure. 
>> Tracy, what are you doing? 
>> Fishing. 
>> We looked inside one of the units and there was a note on the floor. I immediately tried to start fishing for that note through the door. I had no idea what I was doing. I was not throwing the line right. I just had no clue. They started giving us little pointers on holding it tighter or go to the left. 
>> They are saying this way. So come this way. None of us actually ever got it. ???????????? 
>> the great thing about field producing lockup is we witness firsthand how these diverse groups of people under very adverse and extreme circumstances form societies. They have laws. They have rules. They have corporal punishment. They oftentimes have their own language. They form their own cliques. To me that's fascinating. It's watching human nature at its very basic level and seeing how we all are. 

[00:28:14]


>> No two days are alike. 
>> Give me 30 more seconds. 
>> We'll set out to have a plan on what we're going to shoot and arrive at 8:00 in the morning and by 8:10 a.M. Everything has changed. So it creates its own issues but I wouldn't trade it. I love dealing with the inmates I love talking to them. I love learning about people. 
>> It's a way to also look at yourself because there but for certain fates could be any of us. So for me it's just an amazing observation of human nature, an amazing chance to experience ourselves. 
>>> Coming up -- 
>> the judge is out there listening to this right now, mr. Judge, may I say you look marvelous today? 
>> More from the inmate lockup viewers know as the indiana catman. 
>> See you later.@ the issue is suited whether hagel is going to head the department. Lemon crops were not affected by the temperatures in the high 20s. Farmers used wind machines and water to protect their krops. 

[00:32:48]


>>> Due to mature subject matter viewer discretion is advised. 
>>> During a "lockup: Extended stay" shoot our production team spends months inside a single prison or jail. They interview close to a hundred inmates and staff in that period. Everyone has a story and some of the inmates are unforgettable. It is surprising to run into one of them a few years later in another facility. 
>> Hello, everybody it's me the stone. I guess you people probably seen me once before in michigan city. Now I'm down here at wabash. 
>> Few inmates have ever made is more of a lasting impression on us than james stone. We first met him in michigan city, indiana, during our extended stay shoot at indiana state prison. 
>> Say hi to the public out there jinxster. 
>> He was known for his constant companion jinxster the cat he was allowed to adopt through a special prison program. 
>> Trying to make a swimming pool in here. 
>> He was also known for his offbeat sense of humor. 
>> It's a bird, it's a plane now it's the biobucket man. To the bat cave. 
>> Three years later, when we returned to indiana to shoot our extended stay series at the wabash valley correctional facility, we were surprised to see stone again. He had recently been transferred there. 
>> I talk to guys who come in here who recognize me that say you are the catman, ain't you? The best thing I can do is say I'm him "meow." See you later. Stone is serving 101ears for murder and deviant conduct but he says he is a changed man. He credited that to his relationship with jinxster and a nearly identical cat he had in prison years earlier named jinx. 

[00:34:49]


>> As you can see he was a large fat. He wasn't fat either. He was muscle-bound. 
>> You miss your papa. 
>> Because wabash doesn't have a cat program, jinxster lives with stone's family. While he lost his cat he hadn't lost his sense of humor. 
>> Try to keep the happy go lucky attitude and stay in stoneyland for a while there. 
>> Tell me about stoneyland. 
>> Stoneyland is just so I don't have to think about stuff. I take things how I like them. 
>> My grandpa wears them nowadays. 
>> Don't care what other people think. 
>> It's a home run. 
>> I stay in stoneyland. I don't need no psychotherapists. I don't need no medication. If I had an s right there it would mean stone. 
>> Being in stoneyland is how he got through prison. He kept us laughing. 
>> Can you show me your tattoo? 
>> I'll show you mine if you show me yours? Got to take a shot sometimes. 
>> It's a nickname I picked up in tijuana. They call me tijuana tom because nobody beat me in arm wrestling. 
>> You're going to stoneyland. 
>> He is hilarious. He's constantly messing with our gear. Once there is a boom mic over you he'll start playing with it like it's a cat toy. Like drilling a hole. 
>> He's constantly laughing and making jokes of a situation. 
>> It's a north american sewer salamander. Be a nice trophy to put on the wall. 
>> A lot of one-liners. 
>> Hello grandma. You still working as a stripper? 
>> According to marcus murray who did time with him at indiana state prison and was also transferred to wabash, stone's cat and his sense of humor aren't all he's known for. 

[00:36:50]


>> Yes, I know stoney all his tallness and big hair. IT'S AWESOME '70s HAIR. It's an icon actually. It's him and conan o'brien. They're synonymous for having the best and most awesome dos of all time. 
>> Getting haircuts out here whoever wants to sit down out there can cut hair with burrs. Not me. You ain't taking my hair off. I like getting it thinned but don't caught cut me wald. It makes it sort of rough getting haircuts around here. 
>> The lack of a good haircut is not his only complaint about wabash. 
>> This is one of the best meals we got out of the whole menu. And we still ain't figured out what the meat is. It is alpacas or guineas or a combination of both. An alpaq-guinea. Mainly what you get down here seven days a week you can count on it like clock work that is rice and dehydrated potato flakes. As I was saying, rice that means tonight we'll have potatoes on here. Dehydrated potatoes. 
>> They add water to them and it's like sea monkies. They add water, poof, you know. Stone says he had a better diet at indiana state prison because the inmates were allowed to tend gardens and ew their own food. 
>> This place has so much area that is not being used. They could do the same thing down here. If they allowed gardening, this place could self feed itself even. This place has got so much potential. But yet they don't use it. They don't have no cat programs down here. Th't allow no gardens down here. They don't allow no hobby crafts down here. You're pretty much not even allowed responsibilities down here. It's not a place where you have a way of life, you know? Instead it's just you're here. That's it. You're just here. 

[00:38:50]


>> Rehabilitation is a sense of responsibility, sense of duties and stuff like that. If you're not given those or not given the opportunity to accept those then the word "rehabilitation" just don't exist in the first place. We were locked up for rehabilitation. That's what the judge said. I don't see how 101 years have anything to do with rehabilitation unless I will be a mummy. 
>> After 26 years of incarceration, stone says he deserves a second chance on the outside. 
>> Really I've went through all these different courses na, aa, ba's whatever the hell's got an a on the end of it, I've went through them. The cat program, the landscaping program. I've done so many different programs it's just -- I've been reprogrammed, more or less. 
>> I would think I earned my freedom after doing over 26 years already. All I'm trying to do is just get my charges ran together from consecutive to concurrent walk out of here and leave, go home. 
>> Stone hopes a judge will some day accept his request for concurrent sentences. 
>> Open the door. 
>> That would reduce his term from 101 to 51 years. And since inmates in indiana are eligible for release after serving half their time he would finally be able to go home. 
>> If the judge is out there listening to this right now, mr. Judge, may I say you look marvelous today. 
>> When you were last out it was 1985. Things have changed pretty radi the world. 
>> I figured it would probably be like being eight years old and going to disneyland. Going to be amazed at everything you know. For one, cars talking to you. Guys saying stone you need to learn how to work computers. Because you can't survive out there without a computer. And I'm thinking forget about it. I can survive. I don't need a computer. I don't need something to do my own thinking.

>> What will you do on the outsid 
>> what will I do? I just want to dance. No, really. I want to open me up an animal shelter. Open me up an animal shelter slash wood workshop. 
>> It was good to see him and hear what he has been up to. And you kind of cheer for james stone. 
>> I'll be back. 
>>> Coming up -- 
>> I think it's amazing the stuff we can do. We can curl our hair with toilet paper. 
>> Improvised fashion tips from behind bars. 
>> We get caught with this in our hair we will get in trouble and get a write up for contraband. ] number-one office superstore ink retailer in america.

Yeah, but I'm so slow taking them down after all the fatty holiday food. But that's normal. What do you mean that's normal? It doesn't have to be. To me normal means feeling good inside. Not slow. Try some activia. Activia helps with occasional irregularity when eaten three times a day. Keep a video diary and let me know about your new normal. 

[00:44:50]


>>> Any inmate confined to prison or jail is well aware of the many freedoms they are forced to sacrifice. And white some losses might impact you more. 
>> Down the green line, into the green door. 
>> The loss of individual style is an irrefutable reality of incarceration. It all starts when a new arrival must give up his street clothes for an inmate uniform. 
>> One thing people don't often realize is when you're doing time you will be in basically the same outfit every day for years. You might have a few of them so you can keep it clean but essentially you are going to be in the same jump suit or stripes or khakis almost every day. 
>> The philosophy behind most uniforms is to clearly identify inmates from staff or civilian who might be visiting the facility, including our production teams, who must adhere to dress codes themselves. 
>> The dress codes vary from prison to prison. In california the film crew can't wear blue jeans. The inmates wear blue jeans. So if something breaks out on the yard and an officer in the tower needs to shoot a bean bag they have to quickly discern o's an inmate, who's a non-inmate. 
>> Different colors are used to identify the security levels of various inmates. But at the maricopa county jail in phoenix, arizona, sheriff joe arpaio personally chose the black and white striped uniforms along with the pink underwea and socks to send a message. 
>> This is joe arpaio's way to express how we are pay our way back to society. The pink is his way to keep us humbled. It's a way to separate us away from regular society. 
>> Put them in pink underwear. Because they were smuggling the white underwear out of the jail. That is the official reason. The unofficial reason, they hate pink. You never give them a color they like. Why would you give them things they like? 

[00:46:55]


>> Though generally not allowed, inmates sometimes alter their uniforms to fit their own fashion sense. At the orange county jail in soutalifornia we met a transgender inmate who prefers to be called alexis. 
>> Myself and my celly are dressed as girls and the rest are dressed as guys. 
>> Despite his physical appearance cortez was in fact a male inmate housed in a men's unit. 
>> If you are in in the process of having a sex change if you have your male genital parts you are considered a male and will be housed there, whether or not you have breasts or -- it's what's below the belt that counts. 
>> At first it was startling watching these tapes when they came in from the field we thought we were seeing inmates wearing women's gowns or mini-skirts and we were thinking to ourselves, it's odd that jail officials actually allow this. But it turned out this that they were standard jail issued t-shirts and bed sheets that the inmates converted into women's clothing and they actually did a pretty convincing job of it. 
>> Try to make the best of it you know. Just try to doll up a little bit. We have our own personal revlon and l'oreal, mac crayons. We wet them. We play with it. Get it nice and dark and it goes into the eyes. All we do is just -- and she's about ready to go. I don't know where she's going to but she's ready to go. 
>>> We've seen female inmates come up with all sorts of substitutes for eye liner, which like most other cosmetics is bans from the majority of prisons we have been to. But we encountered one inmate who dug deeper than most to find a substitute. 

[00:49:03]


>> Got it. The black stuff from the window and the hair grease makes the eye liner. Just like real eye liner out on the street. Nobody can make it as black as me though. They can't do it like that. 
>> Curlers are also on the list of banned items. But didn't stop orange county jail inmates michelle and stacy from making their own. 
>> We don't have things that people on the outs have. We make do with what we have. And I think it's amazing the stuff we can do. We can curl our hair with toilet paper. 
>> Twist it like this. This gets folded in half. You fold down. 
>> This goes around the curler. Lick it and then close it. There's your curler. 
>> If we get caught with this in our hair we will get in trouble. 
>> Yes. Get a write up for contraband. 
>> It's just toilet paper. 
>> I know. 
>> Get a write-up for contraband. 
>> It's just toilet paper. 
>> I know. Tell them that. 
>> It's altering what it's supposed to be used for. 
>> Altering. That's what they tell us. 
>> Because you know, we could use this as a weapon and like hurt somebody really bad with toilet paper. 
>> See? 
>> Hold on. You have to do the whole pantene commercial thing. 
>> While some orange county inmates concern themselves with appearances, michael charles was all about function over fashion. 
>> When we first met michael charles, we could see something was immediately going on with his glasses. When we got closer to talk to him we could see that the arms were either broken or lost or destroyed and he replaced them with plastic spoons. 
>> My glasses broke so, I'm going to have to make another one. Can you give me another spoon? Thank you. So I'm going to have to bend this. You bite it. When we bite it we make a hole and we put the hole into here. There we go. Now we got them fixed. Slip them on. They should be tighter. And there we. Go we got them set. We have to make out of what we've got in here, and this is what we have, so we're making out. 

[00:51:35]


>> Coming up -- 
>> all these men, they are lonely. They make what is called a fifi. 
>> We discovered the inmate-made device known as a fifi. 
>> Have you ever made a fifi? 
>> Yeah. 
>> And they call it their lady. 
>> And viewer discretion is definitely advised. 
>> The nicest way to put it without getting beeped off of MSNBC.down your little word game. I think your friends will understand. Oh no, it's actually my GEICO app...see? ...I just uh paid my bill. Did you really? From the plane? Yeah, I n manage my policy, get roadside assistance, pretty much access GEICO 24/7. Sounds a little too good to be true sir. I'll believe that when pigs fly.

[00:55:05]


>>> No matter where in the nation or world we travel we find that inmates are profoundly resourceful when it comes to replacing the small luxuries they used to take for granted on the outside. For example, inmates can have TVs. They're just not allowed to have REMOTE CONTROLS FOR THEIR TVs Because they can be taken apart and turned into weapons. Still, there are plenty of ways to change the channel without getting up. Prison toilets don't come with lids. They too can be broken and weaponized. 
>> When you flush the toilet at night, it makes a loud noise. 
>> So james stone made his own. And he decorated it, too. 
>> It muffles the sound almost all the way out. 
>> Orange county jail inmate daniel mir mon tess liked to wash his towels in the sink, but he had no way to dry them. So he showed us his improvised clothesline. 
>> What you do is a little piece of bag, put the soap in it. A little bit of water. It makes it into a clay after a while. And when you stick it to the wall and put a little cardboard and you have your string already, it's nice and strong. Very strong. 
>> While he's items meet a few minor needs, there is a more personal need that inmates long to have met as well. 
>> With the exception of the very few facilities that actually allow for conjugal visits, which are overnight stays between an inmate and their spouse usually in a private area someplace, sex in prison or jail is basically considered a rule violation. But like so many other things inmates are going the ways to get around it. 
>> Listen to this [ bleep ]. They wrote me up. 
>> What? 
>> A sexual toy. 
>> A sexual toy? What kind of sexual toy? 
>> Oh, man, you with that 
[ bleep ]. 
>> It says that they found a glove, an ace bandage and two trash bags and a tampon. 

[00:57:07]


>> What was you making. 
>> They're trying to say i had -- they're trying to say i had a do. 
>> How do you make that? 
>> This is the first time I've had to deal with contraband of this nature being something other than what it is supposed to be. Sometimes we have to deal with the preponderance of evidence. 
>> We eventually learned that the illicit sexual aid industry in prison is not limited to female inmates. Male inmates have an artificial substitute as well. And we were surprised to hear it's known by the same slang word in prisons and jails nationwide. 
>> Sometimes there are certain woords or phrases with universal meaning that arise in each location we film at. One of those words was fifi. 
>> We heard the term used in indiana. 
>> All these men, they are lonely. They make what is called a fifi which is -- it's a glove and some other items and they call it their lady. That's the nicest way to put it without getting beeped off of msnbc. 
>> We kept hearing this word "fifi" and it kept coming up in conversations but no one was willing to admit to having one. 
>> We heard the term again in tampa, florida. 
>> I can't make a 50 in here. I can't make no fifi. 
>> A lot of these guys have two or three life sentences. They find something to make themselves busy in their spare time. 
>> Have you ever made a fifi? 
>> Yeah. 
>> But at the tent city housing unit in maricopa county jail the inmates volunteered to make one for us. 
>> We were shooting some nighttime shots at tent city and there's quite a contrast between tent city during the day when people are working, going about their business, and tent city at night. What happens when the tent flaps go down is one of those things that they do is the male inmates make homemade sexual pleasure devices. 

[00:59:09]


>> All right. Today you guys asked me what a fifi is. So since there's other people that did not want to demonstrate what it is for you. I personally do not use them because I don't have that much in here. I'm going to basically show you what it was. 
>> We thought about it and figured it might really be in bad taste to show you how one of these devices is actually made. But suffice it to say it only takes a few items and they're all legally accessible by just about any inmate. 
>> What do you do with them when you find one? 
>> I don't touch it. I usually find a new guy to touch it for me and throw it away. 
>> Or on a stick. 
>> I've been here a little while. I can designate that to someone else. I'm not touching it. It's disgusting.

>> I know that they got service dogs and other service animals, but to be around trained dolphins that, you know, you know they ain't going to bite you. They're not going tack you. They're just there to play with you and just chill it. It's pretty cool. 
>> It helps to restore injured veterans physical and emotional well-being. 

[00:14:17]


>>> Well, customers at a toronto donut shop just got an extra sweet treat free of charge and it wasn't even on the menu. Now the video is going viral. Take a look and listen. ????????????

>>> That's okay. 
>> Spring like feel. January thaw here. It seems like more and more frequent. 
>>> Okay. 
>> But we are seeing it right now. Temperatures on the mild side. But along with that mild weather it is pretty wet out. We've got dense fog advisory neck basically for all of pennsylvania, new jersey and delaware tonight. Let's start you around 1:00 a.M. It will run through 10:00 a.M. Tomorrow morning. We're socked in pretty much all night and then as we head into tomorrow we'll take look at the visibilities in just a minute. First today your weather almanac we hit a high of 53 degrees. 13 degrees above normal. Not even within striking distance of the record 72 set back in the late 1800's. Our low this 43 was higher than the normal high. Not even close to that normal of 25. It hasn't been cold like that in days. Right now in the mid 40s across the area. Temperatures will generally stay where they are with the fog rolling in. But it has been an issue as visibilities are less than a mile. Less than a half to quarter of a mile across much of the area. Can't see the tops of the buildings here in center city. The forecast as we head into sunday, it's still mild. We've got temperatures even warmer tomorrow. I think we make a run at 60 degrees for philadelphia and points south. But along with that, it will be foggy almost all day. Little bit of drizzle and clouds don't look to break like they did earlier this afternoon. At least a little bit. Cold front towards our northwest that will slide in overnight. That will bring some showers late sunday into monday. And then we have the chance to remain a bit unsettled through tuesday. The colder air is going to come in waves. So it's a gradual transition back towards winter but we've got some showers some of which may bring snow as colder air gets wrapped into this system by the day on tuesday. Temperatures will be in the 40s but falling into the 30s with that chance for some flurries much the colder air will settle in across the area thursday through saturday so turning chilly again. Temperatures will be back into the 30s and 40s but that is after all normal for mid january so what looked maybe a few days ago like a significant cold blast is now just going to return our temperatures to where they should be for this time of year. So a least some drying and nice sunshine will return with that. Again for tonight, 42 the low in the city. 37 in the burbs with that dense fog and some areas of drizzle. For tomorrow, we've got the clouds blanketing the area almost all day. Fog will try to lift by mid morning but it stays damp kind of wet and mild temperatures in the upper 50s. Your seven day forecast shows monday is mild but we've got the showers coming in, too. So it remains unsettled through ABOUT TUEStAY. Tuesday transition day as the cold air really comes in. We can see some rain and snow showers. Nothing too significant at least that's the way it looks right w. Drying out there by wednesday and as we do so, temperatures fall. Back to where we should be with highs in the 40s and lows in the 20's with some sunshine. Next weekend it doesn't look nearly as mild. But it does look nice. That brisk wintry weather returning. Nothing too cold, though, joyce,. We don't really see any snow in the cards except for that chance for a few snow showers on tuesday.

>> for just the third time in about 20 years jeffrey lurie is without a head coach. His first higher ray roads took some time but was finally given THE JOB FEBRUARY 2nd, 1995. Andy reid, however, took only 14 days to find before lasting 14 years in philadelphia. This time around, doesn't feel like the search is going to end any time soon. That's because it look like another candidate turned down the eagles. Notre dame announce dad brian kelly is staying in south bend becoming the third college coach to say thanks but no thanks.

(Josh) Y'all done messed up now. Me going to the semifinals validates everything that I stand for and everything that I came to this competition to do. I feel completely unstoppable. I'm gonna win. 
(announcer) And christine, a 32-year-old student from texas. 
(Christine) Coming here means realizing a culinary dream that I thought I could never achieve. In the history of masterchef, we've never had a blind contestant. Amazing accomplishment. Thank you, sir. 
(announcer) She was considered the underdog. 
(Gordon) Christine, last pick again. Yes, chef. 
(announcer) Even by herself. Who's going home? It's probably gonna be me. Stop doubting yourself. 
(Gordon) It looks stunning. 
(announcer) But as her confidence grew... Christine. Christine. Christine. 
(announcer) There was no stopping her. Are you really blind? Yes, chef, I am. 
(Christine) I just want to be an inspiration to people that they can get what they want. If they really put their mind to it, they can overcome anything. I'm definitely here to go all the way and win masterchef. Welcome. Congratulations. You are the best three home cooks in america. But only one of you can be the next masterchef. 
(Joe) It's time for your final mystery box challenge. 

[00:30:02]


(Gordon) On the count of three, you'll lift that final mystery box. One...Two... Three. 
[gasps] Oh, my god! What? 
[chuckles] Can I touch it? 
(Graham) It's a cookbook. Your cookbook. Oh, my god. It's my cookbook, with my big freakin' mug right there on the front. It says "masterchef season three winner." It's almost too much to take in. 
(Graham) For two of you, these blank cookbooks will be a nice souvenir of your time here at masterchef. But for one of you, all of those pages will be filled with your recipes. And thousands of copies of those books will be on store shelves across the nation. 
(Gordon) Christine, who would you dedicate your very own cookbook to? Um, I think to my mom. Why your mom? Because she was a really good cook, and she passed away when I was 14. And she never left me any recipes. And I've been trying to recreate them since. 
[laughs and sniffles] 
(Gordon) Sounds amazing. Becky, who would you dedicate your cookbook to? My parents, because they've always inspired me to follow my dreams, even when other people didn't think I could do it. 
(Gordon) Josh, who would you dedicate your book to? Without a shadow of a doubt, my mom. Why? She's a...Ama-- she's an amazingly strong woman. And she's my biggest fan. 
(Gordon) Today, there are no twists and no curve balls. You're going into the pantry and choosing any ingredient you want to make an entree worthy of your very own cookbook. And since there are only three of you left, we will be tasting each of your dhes, and the best one will get a huge advantage in the last elimination test before the grand finale. 

[00:32:04]


(Gordon) You've got five minutes to shop in the amazing pantry for the ingredients to make your signature dish absolutely shine. So knock us out. Your 60 minutes starts... Now. Off you go. Let's go to the proteins. The proteins? In theory, this seems like a dream. Go into this beautiful pantry, choose whatever you want, and make a great meal. But I'm actually more nervous than if they would have just given me something. It's gonna be me and christine in the final two. Becky, she doesn't have what it takes to just take it to the next level. She's not even cooking from the heart anymore. We've let them off the leash. Yeah. We're giving them a chance to really find their voice. 
(Joe) We want food that's them on a plate, and I think that's what we're gonna get today. Like this? Yes. Hey, becky, what are you making? Hello. I'm making pan-fried loup de mer. And I'm gonna have a sunchoke puree with that. So why is this dish gonna be in your cookbook? Um, I'm just--i'm really a fan of fresh fish. And I'm also a big fan of just cooking with beautiful ingredients. And I think that that's really something I want to be associated with. Christine. How you feeling? Hi, chef. I feel nervous. The dish today-- what is it? A type of noodle stir-fry with scallops. Um, josh, becky-- which one would you want to see in the final alongside you? I'm gonna have to say becky because I think she deserves to be there. Good luck. Thank you. What are you making for us? I'm making an indian-style chicken curry. I made a curry blend with some whole spices and some aromatics. So this could be a signature recipe for your book? It really could. That looks good. Yeah, it does. Smells great. Thanks. How's the fish coming along? Uh, it's coming along. It looks like you're struggling a little bit. Yeah. Is that all the fish? Yeah. The other filet I used in the fish stock... You put a filet in the fish stock? It wasn't that pretty because I didn't butcher it very well, which I'm not proud of, but... That doesn't look like an entree. You know it's not an entree. That's the first time I've ever seen anyone put a filet in the fish stock. I'm a little nervous now that you don't think this is gonna be enough for an entree. No, I don't think, I know. Okay. 

[00:34:22]


(Gordon) 15 minutes to go, hopefully to woo us with the best dish you've ever cooked so far in this competition. There's, like, no room to mess up at all. It's intense. It's, like, so intense. The level of concentration on all their faces is quite extraordinary. You have each person bringing a unique kind of culinary skill. Christine, whose cooking vietnamese--her culture. Josh, who's showing an incredible ability to build flavors. And you have becky, who's gonna be light, fragrant--elegance and beauty on the plate. My worry about becky's dish is I don't think there's gonna be enough on there. Not only was she butchering the loup de mer, but I mean, she was tcheringit. So she's got these two tiny little filets. I hope there's enough of becky's dish for meo taste. 
(Gordon) Uh, yeah. I'm completely redoing my dish. I'm gonna switch it up, so instead, I'm gonna make a fish soup, and I hope that it'll be enough. I just gotta focus right now. If you have a misstep, you've just gotta rise above, and that's exact what I'm doing right now. It's not over till it's over.

(Gordon) 30 seconds to go in your very last mystery box challenge. One stunning entree that could be the centerfold of your very own cookbook. Come on. Ten, nine, eight, seven. Six, five, four, three, two, one, and stop... All of you. Well done. Okay, as you know, we're gonna be tasting all three dishes. And the winner of this mystery box challenge, it comes with a huge advantage. Let's start with josh. Let's go. Okay. What ithat? Curried cornish hen with basmati rice. And this is a dish that you can see within your book? Yes, I definitely believe this dish will be in my book. It's delicious. I mean, it's beyond delicious. It's phenomenal. It's got that blend, that fragrance, that ground garam masala. It's not too spicy. It's got the heat. The richness as well. Well done. Thank you. High five. That is-- that is killer. Thank you. That is so good. Thank you. Not only has it got that heat and that spice, but I mean, the sauce is thick enough so you get a little bit with each bite. Really smart cooking. Great. Thank you. Good job. Remarkable. This dish shows the best of who you are as a person, and your ability as a cook. No doubt. Congratulations. Thank you, che well done. Wow. Thanks. I think josh definitely can keep his cool in the kitchen. He's confident, and I think he talks the talk, and I think he can walk the walk too. All right, the next dish we'd like to taste belongs in the cookbook of christine. Christine's dish looks great, as usual. Her scallops are seared beautifully. I don't even understand how she gets that type of caramelization being blind. She's really tough competition. I love to see that wok come out. Yeah. So I did a stir-fry with some rice noodles, shallot, garlic, ginger, soy sauce, fish sauce. And then seared scallops that I seasoned with a little bit of salt and chili oil. It's really a complete sensation because it's kind of salty, sweet, rich. The noodles have a great texture to them. It's very intense. How do you know how much of something you put in when you put it in a bowl? Um, I kind of measure it out in my hands, and then I put it in. How about liquids? I just kind of guess and adjust. You taste and then adjust? Yes. Exactly. Wow. Oh, they taste incredible. Thank you. And the flavor of the scallop shines through. Good job. Thank you, chef. I mean, there's two things I can wish right now. I wish you could see this bowl of food, and I wish your mother was standing next to me tasting it because it's a true testament of where you've come in this competition. Thank you. Absolutely delicious. Well done. Thank you. Step, step. Okay, becky, please bring your dish. Tell me about this dish. I made pan fried loup de mer fish soup with sunchoke puree, roasted fennel, and a vinaigrette with charred jalapeno and scallions. I meit's a pretty small portion for an entree. Yeah, the filets were gonna be too small, so I ended up taking the fish that I used to make the stock, and I turned that into, like, a fish soup with roasted fennel. The fish itself, I love the crust on it, but ultimately, it's a little dry. Really? Slightly overcooked. I don't know. It's seasoned well, but it's not a cohesive dish. It doesn't scream who you are. I guess I think that the type of food that I grew up eating is not very, like, sophisticated, so I think that, for me, I'm trying to maybe do too much than I can right now. And I was just thinking about what I should be doing to, like, for you guys, and to beat them, and I just completely lost it, and I don't have a good excuse. There's a lot riding on your shoulders, and you've been a frontrunner. And right now, uh, you're definitely not, especially with a dish like that. It was the wrong thing to pick fo challen 

[00:43:33]


(Gordon) Doesn't quite make sense, does it? 
(Graham) No, and then you look at christine's scallops. Jo knew right away he was doing a curry. 
(Gordon) He had a blend of spices that were delicious. We've ranked the dishes from first place, second, and third. And that will determine who gets the biggest advantage in your final elimination test. The person who cooked the dish at the bottom of the pile was becky. It's down to christine and josh. The person who prepared and cooked the best dish... got glasses. You paid...Wow. Hmmm. Let's see if walmart can help you find the same look for less. Okay. See? Walmart has all these leading eyewear brands and styles. Rockstar! Really? Yeah. Oh, wow! Oh, black frame looks good on you. Yeah? You can get a complete pair starting at just

(Graham) The person who prepared and cooked the best dish tonight... Christine. Yeah, it's about freakin' time! That dish was phenomenal. Thank you. Absotely mind-blowing. How do you feel? Eat. I'm glad I won the last mystery box. I'd be pissed off if this sucker won, man. 
(Gordon) Christine, well done. Thank you. 
(Becky) Going into this elimination is essentially the most pressure that I've ever felt. I have to come back. I have to redeem myself now. Okay, un next is your final elimination challenge. Let's all go into the pantry, and you can find out what the advantages are. Please, let's go. 
(announcer) In the final elimination challenge, all three home cooks will each make one dish, with the best two moving into the grand finale. You are about to find out the consequences of winning and losing that final mystery box challenge. Christine, once you've heard what the three very different ingredients are, 
(announcer) In the final elimination challenge, all three home cooks will each make one dish, with the b josh, for co in second, you get to pick from those remaining two ingredients. Of course, that means, becky, you don't get a choice. 
(Gordon) The theme of tonight's final elimination challenge is... Legs. And the first legs are... Leg of lamb. A classic cut of meat, but difficult to cook. The next legs used to belong to... Chicken. 
(Graham) Used in every cuisine and culture around the world. And the third and final-- personal favorite of mine. I absolutely love them... Hello, kermit. Frogs legs. Wow. So, christine, what legs are you going for? I have to think about do I play to my strength, or do I pick something that leaves someone else to get screwed on? Hopefully I can do both. Maybe the simplest and the least expensive, but I think I can do the most with them, so I'm gonna go with the chicken legs. Wow. Josh. Think very carefully. 

[00:50:48]


[sighs] So essentially, I am picking for me and for becky right now. I mean, this is a huge advantage. What are you thinking? Um, I don't think becky's ever cooked with frog legs before, so I'm gonna have to choose the leg of lamb. Becky, when was the last time you cooked frogs legs? Um, that would be never, chef. When was the last time you ate frogs legs? Again, never. Wow. You all have ten minutes now to shop for anything else you need to make a dish that can get you to the mastercheffinale. That ten minutes starts now. 
(Josh) This is the last dish before the final, so you have to play to win. Now is not the time to be 
[bleep] AROUND WITH FROG LEGS. 
(Becky) I have to cook something with these frogs legs that's going to show the judges that I belong in the finale. And I have no idea how to cook with these things. Okay, we've got a surprise for you, and it's waiting back in the masterchefkitchen. 
[cheers and applause] Who is that? Who is that? It's everybody! Come on! Go stand in front. Are you serious? Wow. These are the home cooks that you conquered to get here. 
(Gordon) Welcome back, everybody. Shut up. They are gonna cheer you on into the finale. Seeing all these familiar faces cheering us on, it gives me hope, and it really does lift me up a little bit. I was questioning myself, but I know that all these guys are behind me, and it really helps with my attitude. Magnificent monti, who do you think, right now, has it to win masterchef? I think this is a girl's game to lose, but I think christine will win. Frank, who do you think is gonna win this competition? There's no question in my mind-- I want becky to win because she has a huge passion for food. Ryan...How have you been? I've been very good, thank you. Who will win masterchef? Josh will win masterchef. 

[00:52:59]


(Joe) Well, it's great to have you all back here in the masterchefkitchen. Please head up to the balcony. Show your support for the final three. 
[cheers and applause] You three, on to your stations, please, thank you. Two of you will be going on to the mastercheffinale. Becky, christine, and josh, your time starts...Now! everywhere. In our homes, our minds. We can share every second in data dressed as pixels. A billion roaming photojournalists... Uploading the human experience. And it is spectacular. So why would you cap that? My iphone 5 can see every point of view... Every panorama, the entire gallery of humanity. I need to upload all of me. I need, no, I have the right to be unlimited. Only sprint offers truly unlimited data... For iphone 5. computer day, you'd think I want to stay away from it at night. Truth is, I like to stay connected with friends. But l that screeme can really dry me out. So I use visine. Aah. It revives me, so I can get poked, winked, and -- ooh -- party all night long. Only visine has hydro a unique blend of three moisturizers that soothe, restore, and protect to keep me comfortable for up to 10 hours. Pirate party, here I co-- uh, honey? Visine with hydroblend. Find it in these visine products. ?????? ?????? ?????? 
[ growling ] ?????? ?????? ?????? ?????? 
[ crunch ] ?????? ?????? 
[ woman ] HONEY, HAVE YOU SEEN OUR CAT? ?????? ?????? nope. Becky, christine, and josh, your time starts...Now. This is the last dish before the finals. We're about to start cooking, and I'm about to take these girls down tod. Where's my chef's knife? I worked my ass off to get here to top three. I overcame obstacles that I didn't think I could overcome, but now I believe in myself. I definitely deserve to be in top two. 

[00:57:45]


(Becky) Josh and christine and i-- we're all in the top three for a reason. But I don't want to just be in the top three. I came here to leave the winner, with that trophy in my hand. Christine got the first pick. She chose chicken. Which one would you have picked? Definitely, for me, it would have been the chicken. I think it's the move versatile. You can use the skin, the bone, the meat. 
(Gordon) Joe. I would have definitely done a roasted lamb, deglazed with anchovies and red wine vinegar. So good. 
(Graham) That sounds great. I would have gone for the frogs' legs. Dusted with lemon powder, a little bit of cayenne, and a little touch of paprika. I think I used the advantage to the best of my ability because I've never cooked frog legs, so I wanted to stick with something I know and can be tasty. I actually picked lamb legs for myself because this complements my style of cooking. I think it's great that becky got the frog legs because she's gonna be out of her comfort level. The pressure right now is on becky. She's never tasted a frog's leg. She's never cooked frog's leg. Josh was trying to trip me up for sure, you know? But I've got to believe in myself, and I've gotta focus right now and not mess up. We're competing to enter into the final two-- the finale of masterchef. I want to see complex dishes, I want to see technique. I want it all. All right, christine, what's the dish? I want to do just, like, southern fried chicken. But how are u gonna refine it in a way that it stands out and lands that place in the final? Just fry it to perfection with the right batter, and then serve it with a cream kale that tastes good. You know, the balance of the texture of the two different components together? Good luck. 
(Joe) Josh, what's the dish? What's the dish? Carimanolas. Can you explain what a carimanola is to me? I'm gonna take a yuca root, boil it, smash it. Yeah. I'm gonna put some chopped corn in there, and cilantro. Then I'm gonna stuff it with braised lamb meat. And you've made this before? I have. This your dad's recipe? Um, well... My dad made me eat it-- we used to go to panama when I was younger. Now you're gonna make us eat it. Have you got enough time to make it? I do. You do? You sure. Yes. Yes. Usually, a leg of lamb braises for seven hours. My strategy is to braise the lamb in a pressure cooker. It's the only way I can get it done in an hour. I think it's gonna come down to the wire. All right, guys, let's go. Whoo!

=======================================================

I'm Laura Linney, and this is Masterpiece Classic. Come war and peace, Downton still stands and the Crawleys are still in it. 
LINNEY: Downton Abbey is back... I'm looking forward to all sorts of things. 
LINNEY: In this special two-hour season premiere. Nothing succeeds like excess. His lordship's in trouble. What?! I'm warning you. Don't-- no one must know. We must act now. 
LINNEY: Downton Abbey season three, beginning tonight onMasterpiece Classic. Captioning sponsored by VIEWERS LIKE YOU Funding forMasterpiece is provided by... not a job, this is a joy.

Support is also provided by Conrad Prebys and Debbie Turner and by the following: And by: The Dowager Countess of Grantham says that a family must never be the topic of conversation. But ever since we met the Crawley family and their houseful of servants, we haven't been able to stop talking about them. In fact, they're so irresisble, they ought to be classified as a controlled substance. We've been waiting for news about them ever since Matthew and Mary kissed under the stars in 1920, and as Mary's mother, Cora, the Countess of Grantham, says, "There is nothing more tiring than waiting for something to happen." Well, we don't have to endure the wait any longer. Tonight we come back to the spellbinding magic of Downton Abbey. Is there any news of Sybil? She's still not coming. She insists they can't afford it. 

[00:03:48]


ARCHBISHOP: Mr. Travis, can we move forward? If I could just ask you to come down the aisle again? Can we get the troops organized? That means me. It seems rather hard on poor old Travis when he's doing all the work but the Archbishop gets the glory. 
MARY: Papa was the one who wanted a Prince of the Church. I'd have settled for Travis. Mmm. 
MARY: Is there really no way we can get Sybil over? It seems ridiculous. On the contrary, it's a relief. Branson is still an object of fascination for the county. We'll ask him here when we can prepare the servants and manage it gently. He's making a problem where none exists. No one could care less were Branson at the wedding or not. You must think country life more exciting than it is if you imagine people don't care when an earl's daughter runs off with a chauffeur. Well, the fact remains, she hasrun off with a chauffeur and they'll have to get used to it. Mr. Travis, are we ready? Any moment, Your Grace, any moment. Can we? Please? That treacle tart just hit the spot. Thank you, Mrs. Patmore. So Mrs. Hughes and Anna are getting the place ready to let? That is the plan. 
THOMAS: I'm surprised Anna held on to that house. I thought they confiscated the profits of murder. Mr. Bates had the wisdom to transfer it to her before the trial. I don't think I'd have allowed it, Mr. Carson. Then we must all be grateful you were not the presiding judge. I still think it's funny, given that he's a convicted murderer. May I remind you, Mr. Barrow, that in this house, Mr. Bates is a wronged man seeking justice. If you have any problems with that definition, I suggest you eat in the yard. 
ISOBEL: I suppose you agree with Robert. Then not for the first time, you suppose wrongly. The family must never be a topic of conversation. I'm afraid Sybil's already made the Crawleys a permanent topic. All the more reason. If we can show the county he can behave normally, they will soon lose interest in him. And I shall make sure he behaves normally because I shall hold his hand on the radiator until he does. 

[00:06:04]


ISOBEL: Well, I don't know this young man aside from "good morning" and "good night," but he strikes me as a very interesting addition to the family. Oh, here we go. And why should he be "normal," as you call it? I say he should come here and fight his corner. I like a man of strong beliefs. I think I'll send them the money. Please don't. Robert's expressly forbidden it. He'd be furious. But it can't be as bad as... Look, I'll come and see you. Tomorrow. No, I insist. Right, goodbye. Papa? What's the matter? Nothing's the matter. What should be the matter? How was London? We got it all done, but I couldn't have managed without my helper. Have you eaten? We had a bite on the train. Well, sit down anyway, have a cup of tea. 
MRS. HUGHES: I'll start on the final lists for the wedding tomorrow morning. I've got the last of the wine deliveries coming on Tuesday. How will you manage without a footman? I agree. But I haven't time to find one now. I've had a letter from my sister asking after a job for her son, and... Miss O'Brien, we are about to host a society wedding. I have no time for training young hobbledehoys. 
(bell ringing) Her ladyship is ringing. Well, I don't see why not. I'll ask his lordship when... 
(door opens) There you are, so I'll ask you now. Ask me what? Carson's in need of a footman and O'Brien has a candidate. Alfred-- Alfred Nugent, m'lord. He's a good worker. 
CORA: I think it sounds perfect. Robert? Whatever you say. My dear, I have to go up to London tomorrow. I'll be catching the early train. That's very sudden. Do you want them to open the house? No, I'll come straight back. What are you going for? It's nothing to bother you with. 

[00:08:24]


ANNA: It's all there. ery entry. Where did you find the book? Behind the bureau. We moved it out to clean and there it was. Vera must have dropped it or something. So what do you want me to do? Make notes on all the names. Close friend, relation, workmate, tradesman and so on. Then I'll copy those and I'll send them with the book to Mr. Murray. Haven't you anything better to do? I have not. Because I'd rather work to get you free than dine with the king at Buckingham Palace. So what news have you got? What news could I have in here? @@ Oh, I've acquired a new cellmate. To be honest, I'm not sure about him. Well, just remember what my mother used to say: Never make an enemy by accident. Now, do you think you can get the notes done before my next visit? I don't see what can come of it. Probably nothing. And my next idea will probably lead to nothing, and the next and the next. But one day, something will occur to us and we'll follow it up, and the case against you will crumble. Do you never doubt? For just one minute? </ I wouldn't blame you. No. I don't doubt that the sun will rise in the east, either. You're too tall to be a footman. No footman should be over 6'1". 
O'BRIEN: That can't be, can it. Since he's already been taken on. But what have you done? I was a hotel waiter after I was discharged from the army, but they've cut back. I think to get a job as a waiter shows real initiative. I suppose he can speak for himself. 
O'BRIEN: Why? Is he on trial? This isn't an interview, is it? Not when he's already got the job. 
CARSON: No, it is not an interview, Miss O'Brien, but he is on trial. And if he cannot match our standards, he will be found guilty. I mean to try, Mr. Carson. As long as you do. Right, go upstairs and get settled in. Your aunt will hopefully find you a livery that fits. 

[00:10:46]


MARY: Just at the start, so we've place to sleep after the honeymoon. You can't object to that? 
MATTHEW: No, it's nice of them, though I doubt I'll get used to taking you to bed with your father watching. He's so relieved we're getting married, he wouldn't mind if you carried me up naked. Careful, I might try it. 
(both chuckle) I don't want to move to London or anything. I'm not kicking against the traces. Just testing their strength. I want us to get to know each other, to learn about who we both are without everybody being there. Well, it's quite a big house. It's a lovely house. It's your home, and I want it to be my home, too. Just not quite yet. Chancery Lane. Yes, sir. I've spoken to Frobisher and Curran, and since I am a trustee should the estate ever need one, we felt I ought to be the one to tell you. You make it sound very serious. I'm expressing myself badly if you think it is not serious. Why did we invest so much? Lord Grantham, it was you who insisted we should. If you remember, we advised against it. But war would mean a huge expansion of railways everywhere. Every forecast was certain. Rail shares were bound to make a fortune. Many did, but your principal holding, which was very large indeed, was in the Canadian Grand Trunk line. It was the main railway in British North America, for God's sake. It wasn't just me. Everyone said we couldn't lose. We knew hard times were coming for estates like Downton, and this investment would make it safe for the rest of time. Charles Hays was the presiding genius, and since he died, the management has not... 
(sighs) The fact is, the company is about to be declared bankrupt, and the line will be absorbed into the Canadian National Railway scheme. Are you really telling me that all the money is gone? I'm afraid so. The lion's share of Cora's fortune? I won't give in, Murray. I've sacrificed too much to Downton to give in now. I refuse to be the failure, the earl who dropped the torch and let the flame go out. I hate to state the obvious, but if there's not enough money to run it, Downton must go. Unless you break it up and sell it off piecemeal. I couldn't do that. I have a duty beyond saving my own skin. The estate must be a major employer and support the house or there's no point to it. To any of it. Morning. Lady Edith! 

[00:13:58]


(chuckling) Hello. Hello. What are you doing here? I'm meeting a train, but I'm too early. Oh. I mustn't hold you up. Oh, I'm not doing anything. I thought I'd get away from wedding panic. Don't you like weddings? Don't be silly, of course I do. Only I've talked of clothes and flowers and food and guests until I'm blue in the face. 
(chuckles) Yes, weddings can be reminders of one's loneliness, can't they? Sorry, I don't know why I said that. So, how's it going? Is your grandmother coming over from New York for it? She is. And Sybil? Is she here yet? As a matter of fact, she wasn't coming, but I think she is now. Mary had a letter this morning. Papa doesn't know yet. He will be pleased. I do hope so. So you'll live at the big house when you're back from honeymoon. Not live, stay. We'll stay there until we decide where to go. It'll be on the estate, I should think, or in the village. Not here? No, but I shall expect you and Mrs. Bird to look after Mrs. Crawley. You'll not be taking me with you, sir? Only I thought you'd be needing a proper valet, once you're married. I've always thought of you as more of a butler who helps out as a valet, not the other way around. Well, I'd be happy to be a valet, sir. Especially in the big house. We won't be in the big house for long. And to be honest, Molesley, I want to live more simply after the wedding. And besides, Mother absolutely relies on you. That's very nice to hear, sir. Thank you. 
THOMAS: You must be exhausted, m'lord. You can't have spent more than two hours in London. It was sufficient. The new footman arrived while you were gone. What? Yes. He got the cable this morning and came straight over. Very eager. And very tall. But when did...? Never mind. Did you know about the new footman? Of course. He's already here. Why did no one tell me? What do you mean? We talked about it last night. In my room. Well, nobody else must be taken on. Absolutely no one. Until things are settled. What things? How's the wedding going? I suppose it's costing the earth. Mary was never going to marry on the cheap. Oh, no Nothing must be done on the cheap. I feel quite nervo. Don't be. You've got the sll and you've got the willingness. But he hasn't got the experience. He's right. Pay no attention. You've a nice manner, Alfred. You're not vain like Thomas. They'll like that. 

[00:16:51]


(banging) What's the matter with you? I'm fed up. They promised me promotion. She said they'd get a new kitchen maid and I'd be Mrs. Patmore's assistant. Well, if they really promised, you should withdraw your services. What do you mean? Like go on strike? But don't say I put you up to it. But what was in the letter? Just that Sybil's coming after all. She'll be here on Wednesday in time for dinner. Will she be coming alone? Don't make trouble, Mother. Can I do it? If you wish, m'lady, of course. Are you really that tall? Yes, m'lady. I thought you might have been walking on stilts. 
(chuckling softly) When does Grandmama arrive? She gets into Liverpool on the 15th, so she'll be here the day before the wedding. I'm so looking forward to seeing your mother again. When I'm with her, I'm reminded of the virtues of the English. But isn't she American? Exactly. Can I help myself? Oh, you want to as well, m'lord? To be honest, I think you'll find that we all want to do it as well. 
(softly): What do you think you're doing?! You're not in a hotel now. Did you train in a hotel? I did, ma'am. I'd say so. 
ISOBEL: That will be useful, won't it, Carson? Are you all set for the wedding? 
MARY: Of course he is. Carson's motto is "Be prepared." I'm afraid Baden-Powell has stolen it. But you have all the help you need? Well, I wouldn't fight the idea of a second footman, m'lady. 
MATTHEW: I don't know about the rest of you, but I sometimes think it's time we lived in a simpler way. I agree. Much cattle, much care. Always supposing we have the choice. 
VIOLET: Oh, don't say that. It's our job to provide employment. An aristocrat with no servants is as much use to the county as a glass hammer. 
(laughing) I knew this would happen. Typical. What's typical? That I'd wind up looking after Mr. Matthew. That's all I need. He hasn't thought it through. I'm sorry to say it, but he hasn't. Are you worried for your job, Mr. Molesley? Me? Oh, heavens, no. No, no, no, I'm essential to Mrs. Crawley. She relies on me-- that's what he said. Essential. Oh, yes, we're all essential... until we get sacked. How was it? Alfred was confused. He thought he'd been transported to the Hotel Metropole. Cheer up. You'll get the hang of it. Will I? Oh, you're still here, Mr. Molesley. I know. I only walked over for a cup of tea and a chat, and I've outstayed my welcome. Nonsense. Why not have a bite with us? They won't be leaving for a half-hour or more. No, I'd better get back. I wouldn't want them to get home and me not be there to let them in. 

[00:19:44]


O'BRIEN: No, you wouldn't. Not when you're essential. Then why is he coming all the way here? Why not say it on the telephone? I have no idea. If Mr. Swire's lawyer wants to see you and it's urgent, it means he's left you something. I doubt it. I would have heard long before this. Anyway, I hope not. Why? 
ISOBEL: Matthew, do come on. The chauffeur's freezing to death, and so am I. Are you looking forward to the wedding? What do you think? I'm looking forward to all sorts of things. Don't make me blush. 
ISOBEL: Matthew! 
(birds chirping) 
(engine stops) Dearest Papa. Tell me, did you send the money? Please say yes. What money? Hello, Tom. Welcome to Downton. I hope I am welcome, your ladyship. 
MARY: Of course. 
MARY: Alfred, would you take the luggage for Mr. Branson? There's tea in the library. Thank you. Hello, Mr. Carson. 
ISOBEL: Was that Mr. Charkham I saw leaving? Yes. He said to make his apologies. He was late for his train. What did he have to say for himself? I don't know where to start. Basically, it seems that Reggie Swire did not wish to divide his fortune. So when Lavinia died, he made a new will with a list of three possible heirs, of which I was the third. Why didn't the first name succeed? He died before Reggie. In the same epidemic that killed Lavinia. But at first they thought that the second heir, a Mr. Clive Pulbrook, would be easy to trace. How much money are we talking about? A lot. A huge amount, I had no idea. You could never have told it from Reggie's way of life. Lucky Mr. Pulbrook. Well, this is it: Some time before Reggie's death, Pulbrook traveled to the East, to India, to some tea plantations he owned there. And? He's never been heard of since. They've made inquiries. They've sent an agent out to visit his property. There's no sign of him. I'm sorry, I won't, and that's flat. Then you'll have to do it, Mr. Carson. I am not dressing a chauffeur. He is not a chauffeur now. Anyway, you don't have to dress him. Just see he's got everything he needs. I am not often as one with Mr. Barrow, but no. Then Alfred must do it. Alfred? He wouldn't know what to do beyond collecting dirty shoes outside the door. Well, he'll have to learn. Is it an Irish tradition? What? She means not changing. Of course it isn't, Granny. It might've been. You don't change on the first night of a voyage. 

[00:23:32]


BRANSON: No, m'lady, I don't own a set of tails. Or a dinner jacket, either. I wouldn't get any use out of them. Well, I hope you own a morning coat since you're here for a wedding. No, I'm afraid I don't. 
SYBIL: We live a completely different kind of life, Papa. Obviously. Could you lower it a bit, please, Mr. Carson? 
MARY: You should buy a Downton wardrobe and leave it here. Then you won't have to pack when you come. What a good idea. I'm sorry, but I'm afraid I can't turn into somebody else just to please you. More's the pity. Oh, no, why should you change to please us? 
MATTHEW: What is the general feeling in Ireland now? That we're in sight of throwing off the English yoke. Do you approve of the new act? Would you approve of your country being divided by a foreign power? 
ISOBEL: Won't it bring home rule for southern Ireland nearer? Home rule on English terms, presided over by an English king. Is keeping the monarchy a problem? Would it be a problem for you to be ruled by the German Kaiser? 
(glass breaks) Carson, are you all right? I have been very clumsy, m'lord. I do apologize. Is it true that Irish gardens have more variety than ours? 
EDITH: Oh, yes. Don't you remember Lady Dufferin's ball at Clandeboye? The gardens there were heavenly. I thought them very down on him. That is because you know nothing. And wasn't he down on them? Insulting our country, insulting the king. I thought it was a miracle his lordship held his temper. But it must be hard, Mr. Carson. To sit up there with people he used to drive around. 
BRANSON: It is hard, Mrs. Hughes. Please sit down. Is there something we can do, sir? I just wanted to come down to say hello. I wouldn't want you to think I'd got too big for my boots. That's nice. 
ANNA: I hope you and Lady Sybil are well? We are, thank you. And we've been following the story of Mr. Bates. Mary keeps us informed. Still, I mustn't interrupt your dinner. Thank you for coming down. He's settled into his new life. "Mary keeps us informed." Well, he knows her now. What's that got to do with it? His lordship would never call her "Mary" when talking to me. Never. If he wants to play their game, he'd better learn their rules. Tomorrow, let's ask the servants to come up and dine with us. It'll make things easier. 

[00:26:04]


MARY: You must get him to stop calling Granny "m'lady." And Mama. We need something that doesn't sound too stiff and grand. "Lady Grantham," of course. And he can call me "Lord Grantham." That doesn't sound stiff or grand at all. One step at a time. So what did the lawyer want? I presume he turned up. He did. And it's rather complicated. But you were right, it was about Reggie's will. So he's left you something. Never mind that now. Just sit down and tell me about the relations that are coming for the wedding. I want to unramble them in my head. Go to bed when you're done. I'll go to bed when I'm ready. What's happened to you? Have you swapped places with your evil twin? I'd like to know where the new kitchen maid is. That's what you promised. They've got a new footman. Where's the kitchen maid? I know and I'm sorry. But I spoke to Mr. Carson tonight, and they won't be taking anyone new on. Except a footman. I don't know how Mr. Carson managed it because his lordship's put his foot down. But you are called my assistant now, and you've seven shillings extra every month. You've still kept me here with a dishonest representation. Oh, dear. Have you swallowed a dictionary? Somehow none of it seems to matter when we're in Dublin. Class and all that just seems to fade away. I'm Mrs. Branson, and we get on with our lives like millions of others. But here he feels so patronized, and he hates it. But you don't regret it? No, never. He's a wonderful, wonderful man. I just wish you knew him. Darling, we will know him. We'll know him and value him, I promise. Anyway... I best go upstairs and make sure he's not too suicidal. Good night. Oh, by the way, I don't know if Mama's told you, but the whole Grey family is coming tomorrow night. 

[00:28:11]


(gasps) Including Larry? Crikey. You'd better warn Tom. Oh, and Sybil, if I weryou, I wouldn't tell Papa about being "Mrs. Branson." 
(chuckles) But who are the Greys? And why does it matter that they're coming? The father, Lord Merton, is Mary's godfather, but Larry Grey used to be keen on me when we were young. Were you keen on him? No, I don't think so. I n hardly remember, to be honest. So what are you saying? Nothing, particularly. But we could run into Ripon and find some tails. We have the money. I won't spend more of that money. All right. But please don't talk about Ireland all the time. I just want to make things easier for you. For me or for you? Don't disappoint me, Sybil. Not now that we're here. 
MARY: Shall I order the car? I don't think I can refuse a lift with Mother and then make the poor man go out again. I'll walk. It might rain. Then I'll get wet. Now come and kiss me. So if they can't find Mr. Pillbox, what will you do with the money? Pulbrook. And they will find him. But if they don't? Then I'll decide what to do. Or we will. Because I can't keep it. No, of course not. 
CORA: Why were you so heavily invested in one enterprise? Wasn't it foolish? Has some of my fortune been lost? Some? All. Or almost all. 

[00:30:30]


(gently): Oh, my dear. 
(sobbing) How terrible for you. It's not so good for you. 
(laughs) Don't worry about me, I'm an American. Have gun, will travel. Oh, thank God for you, anyway. You know what? I'm glad we have a wedding to celebrate. Let's make sure it's a great day. If it's to be our last, let's make it a wonderful last and enjoy our lovely home and the lovely people we've spent our life among. A bit early for drowning your sorrows. I thought it might be better if I moved down to the pub. You're not serious. I can't go through too many more dinners like last night. You don't make it easy for them. Do you really think you can recruit Cousin Robert for Sinn Fein? I don't know what gets into me. I can sethem staring, and I know they don't want me here. Well, don't include me. Or Mary. She wasn't too keen on the idea of a chauffeur for a brother-in-law. Forget that; she's a pragmatist. She could be a tough fighter, too. Let's hope she's not tested. Now forget this and walk back. We're brothers-in-law with high-minded wives. We'd better stick together. It's all there. Friends, though there weren't too many, tradesmen, acquaintances... But I can't see what you'll get out of them. I do not believe when Vera decided to kill herself she never mentioned it to another living soul. We know she left no note. I wish to God she had. But why are you sure it was suicide and not murder? Well, I know you didn't kill her. And what's the alternative? A thief broke in, cooked an arsenic pie and forced her to eat it? It's not a very likely scenario. You can see why they convicted me. I'm going to write to everyone in the book in case she said or, please God, wrote anything that could suggest a desire to die. But how long will that take? Why? Are you going somewhere? I should have gone into cooking. I used to watch them in the ks and I could pick it up in a trice. Why didn't you, then? Oh, it's a hard ladder for a man. For every Escoffier or Monsieur Car????me, there's a thousand dogsbodies taking orders from a cross and red-faced old woman. Who's this you're discussing? Hello, Mrs. Patmore. I didn't see you standing there. Obviously not. My Mum and Aunt Sarah thought I'd be better off as a butler, so that's what I'm trying for. I think you're right. I know I'd rather be giving the orders. To a cross and red-faced old woman. Yes, we know. There. Is that what you meant? Yes. Perfect. Slightly new, but not too different. We'll see if Sir Anthony notices. I know they all think he's too old for me, but he's not. Bates is older than you and you're as happy as lovebirds. Our situation is hardly ideal, but yes, we're very happy together. Which is all that matters. As I keep telling them. I've no time to talk. His lordship's not come up yet. Well? What is it? I was hoping you could help young Alfred to find his way about. As a footman, you mean? As a valet. He's looking after Mr. Branson now. Though I dare say a chauffeur can dress himself. But you could tell him what he needs to know. Give him an advantage. Why? What's the rush? You've heard Mr. Matthew has turned down Mr. Molesley? Blimey, you don't want much, do you? Can you remember what I had to go through to be a valet? Of course. I watched it, didn't I? But young Alfred is to make the great leap in one bound? Well, I'm sorry, Miss O'Brien, but I'm not convinced. If you'll excuse me. 

[00:35:11]


(door closes) It's infuriating, but there's nothing he can do. I don't agree. I think it's feeble. He should will himself not to be ill and then collapse the next day. Whom will you ask instead? I'm not sure. I've known Sybil all my life. So you can imagine how curious I was when I found out you'd be here tonight. I never thought we'd meet in person. As opposed to what? In spirit? Well, you see, to us, in maring you it seemed like Sybil had left Downton Abbey forever. If you know what I mean. I know exactly what you mean. Did they lose your suitcase on the way over? How maddening for you. No, my suitcase arrived safely, thank you. Along with my manners. He's still dressed as the Man from the Prudential, I see. Yes, it's nice to have someone from the real world, isn't it? Hello, Mama. Can I tempt you to one of these new cocktails? No, no, I don't think so. They look too exciting for so early in the evening. Don't you think so, Carson? Better avoided, m'lady. I think so. What a pleasure it is to see you out and about, Sir Anthony. I want to say can I be of any help, but you don't seem to need any. He doesn't need help at all, do you? He won't let me do anything. Mustn't be a nuisance, you know. Are you coming to the wedding? Of course! Well, if you really want me. I do. I really do. You look very nice. Have you done something jolly with your hair? 

[00:37:14]


(giggles lightly) 
(glass clinks) I say, what the devil? What is it? Dinner is served, your ladyship. How's it going? Awkward. Mr. Branson's well away and Lady Sybil doesn't like it much. I don't understand it. He's only had one cocktail. Maybe he was drinking before he came down to calm his nerves. No, I don't agree, and I don't care who knows it! The black-and-tans are there to restore order, are they? Why don't they just murder the entire population? Then you wouldn't hear a squeak out of any of them! Is there any way to shut him If I knew how to control him, he wouldn't be here in the first place. Are you interested in Irish politics, Lord Merton? Well, I was only just saying that I thought... He's interested in Irish repression! Like all of you! Look, old chap, of course this stuff matters a great deal to you... Yes, it does matter-- this "stuff." It matters a very great deal. What's so funny? Nothing. I'm just enjoying this vivid display of Irish character. Please, Tom, we don't need to wear everyone out. Why? What's the matter? Am I not being polite enough? Wait a minute! This was down to you, wasn't it? I don't know what you mean. Yes, you do. I saw you. You put something in his drink, didn't you? Just before we came in. That's not true, is it, Larry? What a beastly thing to do. Oh, come on, Edith. That's not like you. You could always take a joke. The bully's defense. Listen, everyone! Mr. Grey has given my brother-in-law something to make him appear drunk. Could it be drink? No, not drink. Some horrible pill. Sybil, take him upstairs. Il ne manque que ??a. 
CORA: Tom has been the victim of a cruel prank, which I know you will all be kind enough to forget. Forgive, perhaps. Forget, never. Is this true, Larry? I don't know why you're all getting so hot under the collar. He's only a grubby little chauffeur chappie, in case you've forgotten... Be silent this instant, sir! I apologize for my son, Mr. Branson. Unreservedly. I only hope you recover before the wedding. I hope so, too. Since I want him to be my best man. Bravo! 

[00:39:29]


ISOBEL: Well said! Do you really mean it? Honestly? I've told you before, if we're mad enough to take on the Crawley girls, we have to stick together. Thank you, Matthew. Thank you so much. 
EDITH: That was rather marvelous of you to expose Larry Grey like that. You saved the day, really. I wouldn't say that. Matthew saved the day. No, it was you. I do hope we'll be seeing a bit more of you once the wedding is over. Well... Wouldn't you like that? Oh, I should like that very much. Much more than I probably ought to. 
(laughs softly) Edith, let Sir Anthony go. Good night, Papa. Well, that's the last of them. Where are the others? They've gone to bed. So has Edith. And so should we. Golly. What a night for the county to feed off. But it was good of Matthew to show solidarity. I suppose so. We're going to need all the solidarity we can muster. When wyou tell the girls? I think I should tell Mary now. No, not before the wedding, surely. I must. They're disagreeing about where they should live, so it'd be wrong for me to keep it from them. Then they can discuss it on the honeymoon and decide more sensibly. Do you think we should say something to your mother when she gets here? No. She'll go into state mourning and cast a pall over the whole proceedings. Thank God she missed tonight's drama or we'd never hear the end of it. Don't worry. She'll bring enough drama of her own. Mmm. 
CELL MATE: It won't work, you know. And if you don't admit your guilt, they won't let you go when the time comes. How can I admit what isn't true? Why do you have to be so pious? You're a touchy fellow, aren't you? Don't push me, Craig. Is that a warning? Yes. Yes, it is. I'm warning you. I'm not sure about the hat. Is it supposed to look crooked? Don't listen to her. I love it. You're not to change a thing. Anna? I think you look lovely, m'lady. 

[00:42:16]


(knock at door) Stop, wait! Who is it? 
ROBERT: Your long-suffering Papa. I suppose he can come in. What's this for? Going-away. How does it look? Expensive. Twice the national debt, I'm afraid. 
(chuckling) But I know you don't mind. Can I have one moment alone to give Mary my blessing? That's lovely. Shoo, everyone. Go on. Bless me. Of course. But there's something I feel I ought to tell you first. I wanted to wait until you got back, but I don't believe I can. That sounds rather ominous. Hello, Mr. Molesley. I got a message to call on Mrs. Crawley. Very good, sir. If you'd like to give me your hat and coat, sir. Are you going up to the house to welcome the Queen of Sheba? Oh, I think so. Are you? No. I'll pay homage at dinner. I've always admired the way Mrs. Levinson is never overawed by the whole set-up at Downton. Was Napoleon overawed by the Bourbons? 
(door opens) 
ISOBEL: Come in, Tom. May I call you Tom? Of course. Good afternoon, m'lady... That is, Lady Grantham. I'm glad to find you here, because... I want to apologize for last night. Oh, there's no need. We know it was not your fault. You weren't the first drunk in that dining room, I can assure you. Only the first Republican. Well, you've got me there. Why was it you wanted to see me? 
ISOBEL: We've asked Molesley to look out Matthew's old morning coat. He is confident he can make it fit. That's very kind, ladies. But you see, I don't approve of these costumes. I see them as the uniform of oppression and I should be uncomfortable wearing them Are you quite finished? I have. Good. Please take off your coat. Molesley, do help him. If you'll just slip it off, sir. Shouldn't he put the waistcoat on first? What's going on? They're forcing me into a morning coat. He has no say in it? No, he doesn't. And nor do you. Well, what do you think, Molesley? It'll need lifting a little here, m'lady. I'll move the buttons so. I think the shoulders look odd. 

[00:45:24]


(engine stops) Come war and peace, Downton still stands and the Crawleys are still in it. Cora! Mother, how lovely to see you. As wrong as it is. Robert, aren't you going to kiss me? With the greatest enthusiasm. Tell me, where does this comem? I hired it in Liverpool. Why? I thought it might be a gift from the U.S. government to help get Britain back on its feet. Carson and Mrs. Hughes, the world has moved on since last we met. And we have moved on with it, Madam. Really? It seems so strange to think of the English embracing change. Mrs. Hughes, this is my maid, Reed. Sybil, tell me all about the arrangements for the birth. We do these things so much better in the States. Edith, still no one special? Well, well, never mind. You must take a tip from the modern American girl. Ah, Mary, dearest Mary. Now, you tell me all of your wedding plans and I'll see what I can do to improve them. What's the matter with you? Mrs. Patmore knows. 
REED: Should I tell you Mrs. Levinson's requirements during her stay? No, tell her. Yes, Miss Reed. How can I help? Well, to start with, I will need goat's milk in the mornings. Goat's milk? Fancy that. She drinks only boiled water. Really? In England, that is. Shouldn't Daisy be doing this? I ought to take the tea up. I'll have it ready in a moment. No fats, no crab and nothing from the marrow family. 
MARTHA: Do explain again how exactly you are related to all of us, Mr. Crawley. Rather distantly, I'm afraid. My great-great-grandfather was a younger son of the third earl. My, I'm going to have to write that down so I can study it. Look at our page in Burke's. You'll find Matthew there. Good. Because I would so like to understand why he gets to inherit my late husband's money. 

[00:47:36]


(laughs nervously) I know, it's funny, isn't it? 
(laughing lightly) Not everyone shares your sense of humor. But surely it doesn't matter now that they're getting married. In fact, we'd better turn him out or it'll be bad luck for tomorrow. 
CORA: Quite right. You must be the chauffeur I've heard so much about. I am, ma'am. Tou's a journalist now, Grandmama. Oh, well, well! I've heard of those journeys on my side of the water. It's very pleasant to hear of them happening here. It's all right, Mama. You can leave us unchaperoned. After tomorrow, all things are permitted. Don't embarrass me. Bye, Matthew. Get a good night's sleep. How many moments of Crawley history has this room seen? With many more to come. I hope so. In fact... What happened in the search for Mr. Pumpkin? Swire's heir? Have you heard anything? Yes, Charkham sent a telegram. I've got it here, actually. Oh. "Convincing proof of Pulbrook's death, stop. Investigating date." Well, what does that mean? Well, if Pulbrook died after Reggie, then his heirs get the money. But if he died first, then I do. But that's absurd! What right have his heirs to inherit anything? Well, darling, what right have I? And frankly, what difference does it make? I shan't keep it if I get it. Well, actually, you will. Because something rather terrible has happened. You see... Apparently Papa has lost a great deal of money. Enough to ruin him. Enough for us to lose Downton. God, I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. Yes, but surely, if Mr. Pulbrook did die before Swire, then we're saved. Darling, I don't think you understand. Reggie Swire would have put me in his will because he believed I was his daughter's one true love. So you were. Yes, but... But I broke Lavinia's heart and she died. He never knew that. How could I possibly allow myself to profit from her death? To dine in splendor because I took away a woman's will to live? So you're prepared to destroy us in payment for your destroying her? Darling, please! You know I would do anything for this family. Anything except help us. Except save Papa from living out the rest of his days in humiliation and grief. And what about us? What about our children? Oh God, Matthew, how can you be so disappointing? Mary, please... No! Don't you see what this means? Don't you see what a difference this makes? It means that you're not on our side, Matthew. It means that deep down, you're not on our side! 

[00:51:02]


ANNA: How are you getting on with your new companion? 
BATES: I don't like him, but so far I've kept it to myself. So, who are the bridesmaids? You don't care about all that. You're wrong. It's the stuff of my dreams. The panic thner won't be ready, or a frock isn't ironed, or a gun wasn't cleaned. Do you know where you're going for the honeymoon? Oh, I want to talk about that. They'll stay in London with Lady Rosamund for a couple of days, just to get used to each other... 
(laughing) And then they go to the south of France. I'll hire a replacement in London and then I'll come home instead. Lady Mary won't mind. I'll pay. And why would you do that? Well, to be near you, of course. Don't you understand? While I'm in here, you have to live my life as well as your own. Go to France, see some sights, get us some memories. But I wouldn't be home for a month. And won't we have something to talk about? Go. I insist. For my sake. I was so afraid I was going to be late. To think... Oh! Violet. Oh dear, I'm afraid the war has made old women of us both. Oh, I wouldn't say that. But then I always keep out of the sun. How do you find Downton on your return? Much the same, really. Probably too much the same. But then I don't want to cast a pall over all the happiness. How could you ever do that? Tell me, what do you think of young Lochinvar, who has so ably carried off our granddaughter and our money? Do you approve of him? Not as much as you will, when you get to know him. Hmm. Has he gone home to change? Oh, no, we won't see him again tonight. The groom never sees the bride the night before the wedding. Nothing ever alters for you people, does it? Revolutions erupt and monarchies crash to the ground and the groom still cannot see the bride before the wedding. You Americans never understand the importance of tradition. Yes, we do. We just don't give it power over us. History and tradition took Europe intoorld war. Maybe you should think about letting go of its hand. There you are. I see you've said hello to Grandmama. She is like a homing pigeon. She finds our underbelly every time. Dreadful! 

[00:53:47]


ROBERT: No, it wasn't me. Someone sent Sybil and Tom the price of the tickets to come over. 
SYBIL: Does it matter who it was? It meant we could be at the wedding. Of course, I wish it had been you, Papa, but I don't mind. I thank them, whoever they are. Well, I'm very glad you're here but it wasn't me either, I'm sad to say. Well, I lo a mystery. Who could it be? My guess is Cousin Isobel. She always likes to stick her oar in. I'm going to ask her. For heaven's sake, it was me. You? But it wasn't your writing. No, Smithers did it. Like all ladies' maids, she lives for intrigue. You wanted me to come here? I wanted Sybil and her husband to be here for Mary's wedding, yes. Why keep that secret? 
VIOLET: It was silly, wasn't it? I'm very touched. I'll admit it. 
MARTHA: How democratic. It make think maybe I've been mistaken in you. I am a woman of many parts. After all, Branson't... I mean, Tom. You are a member of the family now. You'll find we Crawleys stick together. Not always. Mary, what is it? Oh, nothing. It's just... Oh, Mary, dear... 
(door opens, Mary walks out) Oh, there you are. That's all for this course, don't you think, Daisy? Is Daisy all right, Mrs. Patmore? Oh, yes. She's being such a big help. Now, I think we should check the pudding, Daisy. Don't you agree? 
CORA: It's nerves. Everyone cries at some point before their wedding. But what was the quarrel about? 
EDITH: I'm not sure. I know she accused him of not being "on our side." Well, I hope she's wrong, or that could be rather serious. 
ROBERT: Of course he's on our side. It's ridiculous. I'll go and see him. No, I'll go. I'm his best man. I should be the one to go. What? I know what it is to marry into this family. I'm not comparing myself to Mr. Crawley, but he is another kind of outsider. 

[00:55:57]


ROBERT: Well, I hardly... 
MARTHA: Well, why not? He's the one who'll lose his job if the wedding's cancelled. I see what you're doing, you know. What's that, then? Not responding to my protest. Oh, "Not responding to my protest." Very elegant, I must say. Who've you been talking to? Thomas? Well... Oh, just give me the cloth and I'll dry. But suppose he never gets the money? It's not about money. It's that he won't save Papa when he could. But he has to be true to himself. That's the point. He puts himself above the rest of us, don't you see? What I see is a good man, m'lady. And thnot like buses. There won't be another one along in ten minutes' time. 
BRANSON: It seems big, but it's not big. And if it happens and I get the money? I can't do what she wants. It's strange for me to be arguing about inherited money and saving estates when the old me would like to put a bomb under the lot of you. But? But you're meant to be together. I've known that as long as I've been at the house. And at first this kept you apart and then that kept you apart, but please don't risk it a third time. Because I'll tell you this: You won't be happy with anyone else while Lady Mary walks the earth. Call her Mary, please. Never mind what I call her. I t I'll call you if you let this chance slip through your fingers. 
(gentle knock at door) 

[00:58:07]


MATTHEW: I just need a word. No, go away. I'm undressed. You can't come in. One word. Come to the door. 
BRANSON: Please just give him this chance. 
MATTHEW: I won't look at you. It'd be unlucky if you did. Only if e getting married. Which we are. My darling, I refuse to quarrel about something that hasn't happened and probably never will. That's what Anna says. Then she's right. My darling, I'm sure we will fight about money and about Downton, about how to rear our children, about any number of other things. Then shouldn't we accept it? Matthew, I've been thinking, and I'm not angry now, truly I'm not. But if we can disagree over something as fundamental as this, then shouldn't we be brave and back away now? No. It's not because you're afraid of calling it off? Because I'm not. No. It's because of something Tom said. That I would never be happy with anyone else as long as you walked the earth, which is true. And I think you feel the same about me. Can I kiss you? Because I needo. Very much. No. It's bad luck to look at me. What about if I close my eyes and you do, too? All right. But you mustn't cheat. Good night. Right. I'm off to collect Matthew. You look very smart. I hope so, because I'm extremely uncomfortable. Branson... That is... Tom. I want to thank you for what you did last night. I'm grateful. I mean it. They're both strong characters. I'd say we have plenty of slamming doors and shouting matches to come. Forgive me, I was about to be indignant, but of course you have a perfect right to speak as you do. I hope you mean that, too. I do. Now hurry up. 

[01:01:30]


CORA: You'd ask, wouldn't you? If there was anything you wanted me to tell you. I mean, I'm sure you know. More than you did. And relax. There isn't anything I need to hear now. Because when two people love each other, you understand, everything... ...is the most terrific fun. 
(laughing) Careful, Mama, or you'll shock Anna. I'm a married woman now, m'lady. 
(laughing) I think we should go. What about Anna? How are you going to get to the church? They're waiting for me in the wagonette. I'll see you there. I know mine was a wild, runaway marriage, darling, and yours is the one everyone wanted, but what's so thrilling is that this is every bit as romantic. Thank you. For always being so sweet. Love and position, in one handsome package. Who could ask for more? Never mind Edith. Well... Very, very good luck, my beautiful daughter. Now you've a great big motor car all to yourselves. Just think of that! So we expect you to behave as if you were quite grown up. You can do that, can't you? Have you got everything you need? Yes. Come on, then. Be careful of your dress. 
(children giggling) Settle down. All right? Don't do anything I wouldn't do. 
CHILDREN: Bye! Bye-bye! Have you got everything you need? We do. Now, be off with you and enjoy yourself. I wish we were going. And who'd get the food ready for when they come back? Still, fetch your coat and we'll see her off. Right. See you in a minute. We're just leaving now, m'lord. As soon as we've got Anna. 

[01:04:07]


ANNA: Here comes the bride! Will I do, Carson? Very nicely, my lady. Thank heavens you got everything settled. You had me worried. It's not quite settled, I'm afraid. He won't get off that easily. But you're happy? I am. And what about you? I'm so happy. So very happy, I feel my chest will explode. 
(organist playing "Jesu, Joy of Man's Desiring") It's so lovely that you're here. Come behind us. I can't, I'm not family. But you almost are. Morning. Thank you. Molesley. I'm very grateful to you for keeping Mr. Branson up to the mark. We both are, aren't we? We certainly are. Thank you, sir. This is a proud day, Mrs. Hughes. I don't know if I'm proud, but I'm very glad you're happy, Mr. Carson. You're next, darling. You'll see. Will I? It's so encouraging to see the future unfurl. As long as you remember it will bear no resemblance to the past. 

[01:06:23]


(cheering, church bells ringing) 
(cheering) Good luck. 
(organist playing processional) You me. To be honest, I wasn't completely sure you would. I'm glad to hear it. I should hate to be predictable. 
(both laughing softly) Who will groan first when they see it, Granny or Papa? 
(laughing) I should think they'll howl at the moon in unison. 
(Mary laughing) 

[01:08:32]


(engine stops) 
ROBERT: What in God's name is this? Well, I never. 
CORA: Where did this come from? I ordered it on the way through in London, picked it up on the way back. It's an AC. Well, at least it's English. Welcome back, my darling. How was the honeymoon? My eyes have been opened. Don't I know it. Now come on in. 
MARY: Did Anna get back all right? 
CORA: Yes. Who's that for? And why are you doing it down here? It's for Mr. Matthew. It was creased and I brought it down to iron. You're never looking after him. What about Mr. Molesley? He's staying on at Crawley House. Then why wasn't I asked? Mr. Carson thought it best. Did he indeed? I wonder how that came about. And if you are learning how to do your job, you should never open a shirt in a room like this where it might be marked, let alone put studs in it. Do that in a dressing room and nowhere else. Thank you. Yes, thank you, Thomas, for always trying to be so very helpful. 
(dressing gong rings) So how did you enjoy the South of France? It was lovely, but almost too hot, even now. I think it's such a shame they close things up during the summer. I love the sun. So we can see. Oh, you couldn't be in Cannes in the summer. No one could bear it. I could. 
(softly): Just how long is she here for? Who knows? 
VIOLET: No guest should be admitted without the date of their departure settled. You won't get any argument from me. There's a hideous pile of post, I'm afraid. I've put it on the hall table. Don't look at it tonight. What have you been up to? As a matter of fact, I've found myself a new occupation. But I'm afraid Cousin Violet doesn't think it's quite appropriate. Can we talk about it afterwards? 
MARTHA: Are there still forbidden subjects in 1920? I can't believe this. 
(chuckling) I speak of taste, rather than law. Oh, it's not my taste. What about you, Cora? I agree with Mama. Some subjects are not suitable for every ear. Oh. Pas devant les domestiques? 

[01:10:40]


MARTHA: Come on, my dear, Carson and Alfred know more about life than we ever will. Can't we stop this? How? She's like a runaway train. Shall we go through? 
MARY: What about poor old Strallan? Have you seen anything of him? I don't know why you call him poor or old when he's neither. Isn't it dangerous to let this Strallan nonsense simmer on? To be fair, I don't think it's coming from him. Then ask him to end it. It'll be more effective than if we try. Oh, she ate it, then. I'm never sure about Americans and offal. I think she'd eat whatever you put in front of her, that one. What a gob. Thought Mr. Carson was going to put a bag over her head. Oops! Mrs. Levinson knows you make fun of her. But she makes fun of you. Then we're all square, aren't we? The chimney isn't drawing properly. This oven's not hot enough. Ooh, a bad workman always blames his tools. You're busy. No, I'm not. Well, we're eating in half an hour, but it's all done. Well, if you could spare a minute. This is very good. I hope you didn't open it for me. Certainly I did. To welcome you into this house as my son. I can't tell you how glad it makes me. Robert, I want us always to feel we can be honest with each other. Of course. Because Mary's told me about your present difficulties. 
(sighs) She was right. Losing Downton will affect you both more than anyone. I wonder if she's told you about the will of Lavinia's father? Well, yes, your father toldall about it. But I cannot understand why so much money was put into one company. I couldn't agree more. And now we're to be turned out of Downton... Even Lloyd George can't want that. I'm not sure he's a good example. The point is, have we overlooked something? Some source of revenue previously untapped? If only we had some coal, or gravel, or tin. Well, I can think of someone who's got plenty of tin. So you help women who have fallen over? Not quite. Cousin Isobel helps women who have had to degrade themselves to survive. There's a center in York. Oh, no addresses, please, or Alfred will be making notes. 

[01:13:17]


MARTHA: So what do you do for these women? Well, first we like to send them away. To rest. I should think they need it. And then we try to find them alternative employment. The war destroyed many households. In thousands of families, the breadwinners are dead. So you want me to contribute? You don't have to give money after every conversation, Mother. No? Isn't that what the English expect of rich Americans? But why can't you benefit from the will? You've done nothing wrong. When Swire made it, he didn't know I'd broken his daughter's heart. It was to reward my fidelity, when in fact I betrayeher. If I kept that money, I would be no better than a common criminal. I see. Well, if that's how you feel, then there's no more to be said. I'm ever so sorry, m'lord. I thought you were out of here. Yes, we should be. Please. We're going now. Well, it's a lump, all right. There's no point in dithering about that. What are you going to do about it? I don't know. Well, I do know. Tomorrow you'll make an appointment with the doctor, and we'll see what he's got to say. But what if it's... Stop. If it is-- and I'm not saying it is-- it's best to know now. I suppose so. 
(crying) Now look. You'll not be alone for a minute if you don't want to be. But we have to get it seen to. And then there's expense. If you must pay money, better to a doctor than an undertaker. 
(sobbing) If that's an example of your bedside manner, Mrs. Patmore, I think I'd sooner face it alone. It seems rather shocking for Anna to have to find me en d??shabille. I'm made of stout stuff, sir. Don't worry about that. Are you seeing Bates today? I am. And I can't wait. 

[01:15:32]


MARY: Well, give him our best wishes. I'm sorry, it still seems odd to be found in your bed. But very nice. Oh, as nice as nice can be. I'm going to see Jarvis today and find out what houses are available. Do you have to? When these are our last days here? I thought something might have turned up when we were away, but it seems it hasn't. Would you rather wait until we have to go and find a new house then? After all, darling, you are the one who's pushing us out. 
STRALLAN: But Mary's only just got back from honeymoon. It's her family time. But you are... Please stop saying I'm family when I'm not. I'll be there for the big dinner next week. What is it? I know you don't mean to hurt me, but... Of course I don't. That's the last thing I'd ever wish to do. Then why do you shove me away? I don't want to, not at all, but... If you're going to talk about your wretched arm again, I won't listen. It's not just my arm. I'm too old for you. You need a young chap with his life ahead of him. But your life's ahead of you. Oh, my dear, if only you knew how much I'd like to believe that. Then it's settled. You're not going to push me away anymore, and you are coming for dinner tonight. at's all there is to it. How'd you get on with Vera's book? I had a few answers waiting for me when I got back, and two returned "address unknown." Who from? Let me see... One was a Mr. Harlip, I think. And the other was Mrs. Bartlett. Harlip doesn't matter. He was a cousin in the north. She never saw him. But Mrs. Bartlett's a shame. She lived round the corner, she was very friendly with Vera. I'll find her. Don't worry. Tell me about France. Did you eat frogs' legs and dance the cancan? No. But I bought a garter. You have no other symptoms? Not that I'm aware of. You're not feeling ill or tired? I can't swear to not feeling tired, but nothing out of the ordinary. Very well. Well, I'm just going to conduct a preliminary examination. Do you mind if I stay? I should prefer it. What have you got there? Mr. Matthew's tailcoat. What do you think that is? Hmm, hard to say. I've tried it with all the usual things, but I can't shift it. I'll give you a tip if you like. Would you, really? But keep it to yourself. I don't want to give away all my secrets Oh, there you are, my dear. Good morning, Granny. I've been looking for you. Now, I want to know if we're serious. About getting that woman, about asking your other grandmother, to come to our aid. She's made of money, and there's only Mama and Uncle Harold to share it when she's gone. We can't wait that long. She looks as if she'll bury us all. No, we must act now. We must make her feel it is her duty to save Downton. But how? What can we do? Well, get her to sense its value, of its vital role in the area. You're her granddaughter. This will be your house if it survives. Surely you can make something of that, if she has a heart at all. We'll come for tea this afternoon. Then we can begin. Believe me, there are several stages to go through before there's any cause for despair. What... stages? When you come back in a day or two I will remove some fluid from the cyst. With any luck, it'll be clear and that will be that. How will you do it? With a syringe. Will it hurt? Since he has to do it whether it hurts or not, I don't see the point of that question. What I want to know is, what happens if the fluid is not clear? It will be sent away for analysis. Because it may be... cancer. It may be cancer, but I am fairly certain it is not. There you are. It's very, very unlikely. Isn't it, Doctor? If the doctor treats me like an adult, Mrs. Patmore, why do you insist on treating me like a child? Does this seem slow to you? Not really. Mrs. Levinson is going to the Dower House with the others for tea. I think he likes me. He's being friendly, that's all. Are you all right? You seem to have been slaving away for hours. I want to be up to date with it all before I go back into the office. Anything from Mr. Swire's lawyer? You can read it if you like. 

[01:21:30]


(sighs) So you are definitely Reggie's heir? Looks like it. But if they have to get a death certificate out of the Indian authorities, it won't all be settled by Tuesday. Good. Why is it good? The delay may give you time to change your mind. Stop punishing me, Mary. Please. If I accepted the legacy, I would be taking money under false pretenses. I'd be stealing. Your father understands, now why can't you? I don't think he understands at all. He just doesn't want to beg. Anyway, I'm off to Granny's for tea. I'll see you later. I do love you so terribly much. Yes. I know you do. 
CORA: So what's Harold doing now? His id??e fixeisyachts. Bigger yachts, faster yachts, something with yachts. Is he happy? He's much too busy to find out. It always seems so strange to me that Cora has a brother. Why? You know how things work here, Mother. If there's a boy, the daughters don't get anything. 
VIOLET: There's no such thing as an English heiress with a brother. Why do we never see him? Oh, Harold hates to leave America. Curious. He hates to leave America. I should hate to go there. You don't mean that, Granny. When we're both so drawn to Anerica. Indeed, indeed we are. Never more than now, when the bond between the Crawleys and the Levinsons is so strong. 
CORA: That's nice. If you mean it, Mama. I do. It is marvelous the way our families support each other. You mean you needed the Levinson cash to keep the Crawleys on top. I'm not sure we'd put it that way. I am quite sure we would not. But I hope you do feel that Mama's fortune has been well spent in shoring up an ancient family. Well, you gotta spend it on something. What happened here? I... I just... You just what? There was a mark in it. WellI know there was a mark in it, but you didn't need to burn it away. What have you done? Well, I'll go down in my dinner jacket. You can send it to my tailor in London in the morning. Come on, nobody's died. Just find the dinner jacket. Mrs. Hughes, there don't seem to be any glasses laid for the pudding wine. Oh, are they having one tonight? It's on the menus. I don't write them for my own amusement. No, I dare say not. Mrs. Hughes, I am trying, and so far failing, to persuade his lordship to bring the staff levels back up to snuff. But until he does, it is vital that you pull your weight. 

[01:24:37]


(sighs) Newport's not a jungle, not at all. But it is a little less formal. Well, Matthew obviously wants you to feel at home in his play clothes. 
(chuckling) Don't blame me for this. I'm afraid Alfred and I had a bit of a disaster earlier. Why, what happened? Somehow the poor chap managed to burn a hole in my tails. But don't worry. It can be mended. Careful, Carson, steady the Buffs. Beg pardon, m'lord. I rather like dinner jackets. And I agree with you: sometimes it's nice to be informal. Especially when a couple is alone. 
MARY: But people like us should lead the fight to keep tradition going. If you mean we can never change, I can't agree to that. Nor me. I think accepting change is quite as important as defending the past. 
MARY: But the role of houses like Downton is to protect tradition. That's why they're so important to maintain. Don't you agree, Mrs. Levinson? We must do everything in our power to keep houses like Downton going. Sure, if you think it's worth it. So who's coming to dinner next week? Some locals. We thought you'd like to see Downton on parade. That's right, Grandmama. I'm glad we've planned a dinner. We can show you the real point of Downton. 
ALFRED: I don't t to say, Mr. Carson. 
O'BRIEN: What's going on here? Alfred has embarrassed the family. He forced Mr. Matthew to appear downstairs improperly dressed. Oh, you make it sound quite exciting. I will not tolerate vulgarity, thank you, Miss O'Brien. I'm sure Alfred didn't mean to, Mr. Carson. I asked Thomas how to get a mark... Oi, oi, what's this? The stuff you gave me to clean the tails burned a hole in them. No such thing. I gave you some soda crystals, that's all. If you used them wrongly, it's not my fault. This is what comes of making him run before he could walk. If you want me to stay away from her, of course I will. I know it sounds harsh... Please, Robert. I understand completely. Lady Edith is your daughter and you don't want her involved with some cripple who is far too old. Now you're the one who's harsh. The trouble is, she calls round regularly. I can hardly ask for her not to badmitted. I suppose I could write to her. I hope you won't feel we can't be friends after this. But let's leave it f while. I'll duck out of the dinner next week. It might be best. Thank you. That's the one you should have taken. Soda crystals. But he didn't give me that. He pointed to this one. I promise. You don't have to promise. I believe you. So you think he's not ready? He's just a lad, m'lord. He can see to the odd visitor, but permanent valet to Mr. Matthew? It's too much. Actually, I'm pretty sure Mr. Crawley would rather manage on his own. They wouldn't like that downstairs, m'lord. I was afraid you'd say that. So what would you suggest? Ask Mr. Molesley to join us. It'd be kinder to Alfred in the long run, kinder than asking more than he can give. How is that poor footman? I thought Carson was going to eat him alive. Very glum. To be honest, he has been a clot. I'll have to send the coat up to London. Well, get it done quickly. This dinner has to be the grandest of the grand. What do you hope to show her? Why Downton matters. Why it mustn't be allowed to fall apart. Hasn't Cora had her share of the Levinson gold? I thought what was left was headed for your uncle. It's not so laid down in America. He's as rich as Croesus as it is. So you mean to fleece her? Since you're the one to get us out of this hole if you wanted to, I won't take any criticism, thank you. Will she do it? Granny means to make her, or die in the attempt. Now stop talking and kiss me, before I get cross. Well, you heard him. With any luck, you'll know at once. I wish you could get those maids under control. They've broken one of the serving dishes this time, and with the dinner next week! We're short of a footman, we're short of a kitchen maid and one house maid, at least. That's if Anna is to be a proper lady's maid, which is what Lady Mary wants. Well, naturally. She likes things done properly. For heaven's sake, we can't do things properly until either his lordship allows us the staff we need or until you and the blessed Lady Mary come down from that cloud and join the human race! I can only suppose that you are overtired. I bid you good night. You see, she's... Good night, Mr. Carson We will discuss the dinner in the morning. And no, Mrs. Patmore, you may not tell him. Have you finished with Mr. Matthew? I have, he's in the dining room. Very good. You won't need to attend to him again. Mr. Molesley will be coming up from the village. Has Mr. Matthew complained? He didn't have to. It's not your fault. We've hurried you along too fast. You mustn't feel badly. This is Thomas's doing. But don't you fret. I'll make him sorry. I'm on your side. 

[01:30:31]


(laughs) I'm glad somebody is. No Mary? She says she's a married woman now, so she can have breakfast in bed. I'm sorry about your tails. 
MATTHEW: Carson's sending them up on the London train this morning. They'll have to put a new panel in. 
ROBERT: We thought we'd get Molesley to come and look after you. He knows your ways. I'm perfectly happy to... I think it best if he comes. I do need to talk to you about the other staff we need, m'lord. 
(silverware clanking) Not now, Carson. But you may send for Molesley if Mrs. Crawley has no objection. 
(silverware drops) Edith? Oh, Papa, how could you? 
(sobbing) Golly. Do you know what that was? I'm afraid I probably do. I'm sorry, but quite enough of my father's money has already been poured into Downton. Why should Harold lose half his inheritance because of our folly? So it's all Papa's fault? Well, it isn't my mother's and it isn't my brother's. I don't see why they should pay for it. We're still going to ask. What are you so afraid of? If we sell, we move to a smaller house and a more modest estate. We don't have to go down the mine. You don't understand. Mary, a lot of people live in smaller houses than they used to. Which only goes to show that you're American and I am English. I shall be Countess of Grantham one day, and in my book, the Countess of Grantham lives at Downton Abbey. 
(bell tolling) 
ISOBEL: What job might you be suited to? Because we're not simply here to give you food. We must try to find you your place in the world. Do you want to speak to me? Yes, Mrs. Crawley, I do. Have you come for our help? You're very welcome if you have. Wait a minute. I know you. You were the maid who brought your child into the dining room at Downton that time. I'm sorry, this has been a mi I thought I was ready to ask you, but I'm not. I'm not ready. Ask me what? 

[01:33:09]


(door opens) 
(sighs nervously) I'm sorry to keep you waiting, ladies. The fact is it's not quite as simple. Oh, my God. Mrs. Patmore, will you please leave the hysteria to me? I'm afraid the test was inconclusive. I had hoped that the fluid from the cyst would be clear, but there are traces of blood in it. Not enough to confirm the presence of cancer, but a little too much to exclude it. So what happens now? I send it away for analysis. And this stage will take some time. How much time? Anything up to two months. Oh, my... Until then, please try ake it a little more easily. Sit down and put your feet up, if you can. Ooh, the chance'd be a fine thing. Would you like me to say something to Lady Grantham? No, thank you, Doctor. I'll speak to her myself, if I need to. Thank you. 
(crying) My darling girl. What's this? I think you know what it is, since you asked Sir Anthony to write. Edith, you do understand that I only ever want what's best for you. And you're the judge of that. In this, I think I am. Sybil marries a chauffeur and you welcome him Downton. But when I'm in love with a gentleman, you cast him into the outer darkness. She has a point, Robert. Strallan is certainly a gentleman. Well, besides which, Edith tells me he has a house, he has money, he has a title, everything that you care about. You make me sound very shallow. Aren't you? When you make me give him up because he has a bad arm? Oh, it's not the only reason. He's a quarter of a century too old. Did she tell you that? Your daughter is sad and lonely, Robert. I don't mean to interfere, but... Don't you? If you ban him from Downton, I'll only go to his house. I mean it. I don't believe he'd see you. Then I'll just wait outside until he does. How can you not like him because of his age? When almost every young man we grew up with is dead! Do you want me to spend my life alone? I didn't say I don't like him. I like him very much. So do I, Papa. Oh, so do Please ask him back. He writes he's not coming to Mama's dinner, but please make him. Please, please, please. Oh, all right, then. I've found Mrs. Bartlett. I wrote ck to the tenant of her old house explaining, and they've sent me a forwarding address. I don't hy they didn't before. Just because you know where she is doesn't mean she'll talk to you. Why not? Audrey Bartlett was the nearest thing Ve to a friend. That's why I want to meet her. Maybe, but when she looks at you, she won't see the real Anna Bates. She doesn't have to like me. I need her to be honest. I'm going to write and ask for a meeting. I can get to London and back in a day. She won't agree. I've the rent from the house so I can make it worth her while. Why do you think Vera didn't go and see her instead of sending that letter? What do you mean? When Vera was frightened about your visit, she wrote that letter, saying how scared she was, instead of walking round to see her friend. Maybe she did both. So what's the news at home? I shouldn't tell you, really. I haven't told any of the others. It's breaking the code of a lady's maid. 

[01:36:53]


(whispering): His lordship's in trouble. It seems they may have to sell. What? Sell Downton? That makes me sad. I wouldn't have thought there was much that could touch me in here, but that does. 
(panting) 
(knocking at door) It's never come. They promised and promised and I thought it was sure to be on the 7:00, but it's not. Well, I'll just have to wear black tie. But Lady Mary, she'll... These things don't matter as much as they did. Lady Mary knows that as well as anyone. Thank you. I know I'm early... 
MARY: Granny! Come and see what we've done! Ooh, excuse us. What do you think? Nothing succeeds like excess. When shall we tackle her? After dinner. We'll get her on her own. She won't want to see all this go. Not now she knows it's for her own granddaughter. She won't. Never mistake a wish for a certainty. Let's hope she won't. 
DAISY: Mrs. Patmore... What is it now? It's smoking. The range. The wind must be in the wrong direction. Just rake it through. Where's Alfred? Why? Where's Alfred?! I think he's in the servants' hall. Where are they? Where are what? His bloody evening shirts, that's what! Where have you put them? I haven't touched his evening shirts. Why would I? Have you done this? Thomas, why would I know anything about his lordship's shirts? When I find out... Keep your histrionics to yourself and hurry up about it. Her ladyship's already in the drawing room. Are you telling me his lordship's not even dressed? You can't have lost them all! I haven't lost any of them, m'lord. They've... they've been taken by someone, stolen, pinched. Why would they do that? To get at me, m'lord. Are you not popular downstairs? Oh, I wouldn't say that, m'lord. But you know how people can be. They like a little joke. Well, I'm sorry, but this is quite unacceptable. If you uncover the culprit, refer them to me. But for now, what are we going to do? Good evening, Sir John. It can't be going out! Well, it is. There must be a block in the flue. But the dinner's not cooked. We haven't even put in the souffl??s. 

[01:40:17]


DAISY: There'll be no souffl??s tonight. 
MRS. PATMORE: And the mutton's still raw. What in heaven's name is going on? I'll tell you what. We've 20 lords and ladies in the drawing room waiting for dinner, and we've got no dinner to give them. Oh, my God. Why are you not in white tie? Darling, please forgive me. I'm afraid they never sent my tails back. You are not in white tie either. What have you come as? I'm so sorry. Thomas has lost all my dress shirts. Why is he still here? I thought you'd given him his marching orders. I had, but my dear mother-in-law intervened. I've a good mind to tell her... No, no, no, not tonight. She must have it all her own way tonight, don't you think? Oh, you two are dressed for a barbeque. I feel like a Chicago bootlegger. I don't even know what that means, but it sounds almost as peculiar as you look. Robert, come quickly. What is it? Apparently the oven's broken down. 
ROBERT: It can't have done. What does that mean? To cut a long story short, it means we have no food. Oh! Funny clothes and no food. It should be quite an evening. Thank you, Mother. Nothing's cooked, and nothing's going be cooked. But surely... Shall we just tell them to go home? No, Cora, please, come on. They've come for a party and we're going to give them a party. Carson, clear the table. You go down to the larders, you bring up bread, fruit, cheese, chicken, ham, whatever's edible. We're going to have an indoor picnic. They are going to eat whatever they want, wherever they want, all over the house. Are you quite sure, madam? It's not really how we do it. How you usedto do it. Oh, come on. It might be fun. I agree. We'll all pull together and it'll be great fun. Yes! Now, I know what we need. 
MARTHA: Does anyone here play the piano? Oh, Mama, this is so exactly not what we wanted the evening to be! If it's the end of your undignified campaign, I won't be sorry. We can't just give up. Certainly not. Do you think I might have a drink? Oh, I'm so sorry. I thought you were a waiter. Slice that finely, and fetch some parsley. And cut the dry bits off. 

[01:42:27]


ALFRED: You're good to lend a hand. 
REED: I don't mind helping. I think it's good to do other things sometimes. I know you do. 
MOLESLEY: There's not much left of this. Better cut it in squares and put it with the ham. You're very smart in your new valet's outfit. Alfred, go and check the meat larder. Bring anything back you think a human being could swallow. Chop, chop, Mrs. Hughes. We can rest later, but not yet. But Mr. Carson, would you just... Mr. Carson's quite right. There's not a minute to lose. Psst. Do you want to know a secret? Those shirts that Thomas thinks you stole? I saw who took them and I know where they are. Who did take them? Never mind that. But I followed. I'll show you if you want. Why are you being so nice to me? Because I like you. And you can say it? Just like that? I'm an American, Alfred, and this is 1920. Time to live a little. I thought you were just trying to find something out for Mrs. Levinson. What would she need to find out when she can read them all like the palm of her hand? She won't help, you know. Help with what? Never mind. Just kiss me again. 
MARTHA: Now all of you, find whatever it is you want to eat and take it wherever you want to sit. Anywhere? Anywhere all over the house. If any of you have ever wanted to explore Downton Abbey, this is your chance. I'm sorry if it's all a bit casual. It's exciting, Lord Grantham. I feel like one of those bright young people they write about in the newspapers. Thank you, Lady Manville. Cheer up. She won't be here forever. But how much damage will be done before she goes? ?????? Let me call you sweetheart ?????? ?????? I'm in love with you ?????? ?????? Let me hear you whisper ?????? ?????? That you love me too ?????? ?????? Keep the love light glowing ?????? ?????? In your eyes so true ?????? ?????? Let me call you sweetheart ?????? ?????? I'm in love... ?????? ?????? With you. ?????? 

[01:45:16]


(some laughter, applause) 
MRS. HUGHES: Is there anything for our supper? I've hidden a veal and egg pie. Oh, I wish you'd let me talk to Mr. Carson. I don't want to be a sick woman in his eyes for the next two months. Or a dying one in the months to come after that. 
(sobbing) Shh, shh... I know it'll be all right. No, you don't. But I appreciate the sentiment. 
STRALLAN: Are you absolutely sure you won't wake up in ten years' time and wonder why you're tied to this crippled old codger? Only if you keep talking like that. Do you know how much you mean to me? You have given me back my life. That's more like it. And you're certain you won't wait? To give you the chance to change your mind? Don't worry. I can get it organized in a month. Shall we tell them tonight? No, no. I'll come back in the morning. 
(sighs happily) Alfred, can I ask you something? Why do you like that American girl? Steady! Who says I do? Don't you? All right, I suppose I do. And it doesn't matter that she's fast or that you won't see her again after she's gone home? So what? She made me feel good about myself, Daisy. I feel good for the first time since I came here. That's what matters to me. Alfred, hurry up. I need you to take round the claret. All through the rooms? Won't they spill it on the floor? If you ask me, we are staring into the chaos of Gomorrah. But we have to give them more wine, and you are going to help. What's that? I've to take it upstairs, for his lordship. Then be quick about it. But of course I'll help you any way I can. Thank heaven. Oh, it seems our family owes Downton's survival to the Levinsons not once but twice. No, I'm so sorry, but you've misunderstood me. No, I cannot rescue Downton. It's a shame if it has to go, but I can't. But why not? Because your grandpa tied the money down. He felt that the Crawley family had quite enough. But you said you'd help us. I can entertain all of you in Newport and in New York and I can add to Cora's dress allowance, but that's all. My income might be generous, but I cannot touch the capital. Besides, Mary, the world has changed. These houses were built for another age. 

[01:48:05]


(exasperated sigh) Are you quite sure you want to continue with the bother of it all? Quite sure. If I were you and I knew I was going to lose it, I should look on the sunny side. Both of our husbands tied the money up tight before they were taken. Lord Grantham wasn't taken. He died. I suppose it's scrap sandwich for the servants tonight. Mrs. Patmore's kept something by. Who put them back? What? The shirts. Who put them back? 
O'BRIEN: Oh, they're back, are they? You mean you overlooked them in the first place. Don't tell me what I mean, Miss O'Brien. I'm warning you... Listen to yourself. You sound like Tom Mix in a Wild West picture show. Stop warning me, and go and lay out his lordship's pajamas. 
(laughing) What are you laughing at? Seems those missing shirts went for a walk and now they've come home. Really? Have they? You didn't see nothing. I agree. Because if you did, I'll cut you. 
(choking) Don't ever threaten me. I forgot I was sharing a cell with a murderer. Don't forget it again. 

[01:50:15]


MARTHA: This evening has made me homesick for America. It's time to go. I don't suppose you want some whisky to take to bed? Oh, but I'd love one. No water. Thank you. I'm sorry I can't help you keep Downton, Robert. That's what Mary wanted. Ah. I thought there was something. You know, the way to deal with the world today is not to ignore it. If you do, you'll just get hurt. Sometimes I feel like a creature in the wilds whose natural habitat is gradually being destroyed. Some animals adapt to new surroundings. It seems a better choice than extinction. I don't think it is a choice. I think it's what's in you. Well, let's hope that what's in you will carry you through these times to a safer shore. 
CARSON: Is everything all right? Certainly. Was there something you wanted? The kitchen managed well tonight in difficult circumstances. His lordship sent his thanks. Was the evening a success? The odd thing is, I think it was. Though for me, everyone sprawled on the floor, eating like beaters at a break in the shooting, that's not a party. It's a works outing. Where's the style, Mrs. Hughes? Where's the show? Perhaps people are tired of style and show. Well, in my opinion, to misquote Dr. Johnson, if you're tired of style, you are tired of life. 

[01:52:25]


(chuckles) Good night, Mr. Carson. You'd say if anything was wrong, wouldn't you? I know I've been a bit crabby, but I am on your side. Thank you for that. You've just missed an admirer. Mr. Carson says you did well tonight. Did you tell him? No. And what is there to tell? One day I will die. And so will he and you and every one of us under this roof. 
(sighs) You must put these things in proportion, Mrs. Patmore, and I think I can do that now. 
LINNEY: Next time... 
EDITH: Something happening in this house is actually about me. 
ROBERT: Of all of them, Anthony Strallan is the most traditional choice. Edith is beginning her life as an old man's drudge. 
CARSON: So it is cancer. Don't say anything. 
MARY: So this is the moment when you receive a huge fortune that can save Downton and you give it away. Darling, I hope you can understand. I'm trying. Downton Place. 
VIOLET: What about me? Where am I to go? We still own most of the village. Perhaps I could open a shop.

I'm Laura Linney, and this is Masterpiece Classic. Violet! 
LINNEY: Previously... Are you really telling me that all the money is gone? I'm glade have a wedding to celebrate. Welcome to Downton, Tom. I'm not dressing a chauffeur. I want him to be my best man. 
ROBERT: I'm so very happy. 
ANNA: I'm going to write to everyone in the book in case she said anything that could suggest a desire to die. 
ISOBEL: I know you-- you were the maid who brought your child to Downton. 
DR. CLARKSON: I'm afraid the test was inconclusive. 
EDITH: I know they all think he's too old for me, but he's not. You've given me back my life. So you are definitely Reggie's heir. How could I possibly allow myself to profit from her death? Have we overlooked some source of revenue? I cannot rescue Downton.

[00:03:44]


(chuckling) See, I told her everything would come right, but she wouldn't believe me. I still can't. Something happening in this house is actually about me. The dress came this morning. I was rather sad you decided against Patou. I would have paid. Lucille was safer. We don't want her to look like a chorus girl. How's Anthony? Excited, I hope. Desperately. Just when he thought his life would never change, he's going right back to the beginning. Oh, what an invigorating prospect. I hope you've got your shirt ready for tonight. In case you're interested, I've hidden a couple so I won't be caught out that way again. Why should I be interested? That goes for you, too. What have I ne? Take no notice. 
MRS. HUGHES: Anna? Are the flowers do? Yes, I'll check them on Saturday morning and lose anything that's going over. I've kept back a few in bud. I'll be home for the dressing gong. Oh, we'll manage. Still no word from the doctor? 
(door closes) 
(whispering): I'd have told you if there was. By heck, they don't mind stringing it out. Shall we go and see him? 
MRS. HUGHES: Why? I'm sure if he knew anything, he would have said. How are you today, Mr. Molesley? Oh! Very well, thank you. You were talking the other night about your friend's daughter. Is she still looking for a place? She is. You read about the servant shortage in the newspapers, but she can't find a situation for a lady's maid. Not one. She'll end up as a housemaid if she's not careful. Oh, we can't have that, Mr. Molesley. But if I were to tell you something, you must promise not to breathe a word of it downstairs. Miss O'Brien doesn't want it known. How will they advertise it? I don't know exactly. "Desirable nobleman's mansion with surrounding estate and properties." Where will you go? We have some land further north at Eryholme, on the border with Durham. It came with my great-grandmother. The house is pretty and we might make something of it. We could always rename it Downton Place. Who lives there now? A tenant, but we can come to an arrangement that keeps him happy. Let's take a picnic there tomorrow. Take a break from the wedding on Edith's last day of freedom. Molesley's in the hall. He wonders if he might have a word. I'll come through in a minute. Not with you, with Mama. 

[00:06:15]


MARY: Molesley? Your ladyship, may I have a word? Of course. M'lady, might I be allowed to put forward a candidate as Miss O'Brien's replacement? What? 
MOLESLEY: When the time comes. 
ROBERT: Is O'Brien leaving? I hope I've not spoken out of turn. Only I didn't want to let it go and miss the chance. I thought you knew. Of course I know. Thank you, Molesley. I'll be happy to listen to recommendations when, as you say, the time comes. Thank you, m'lady. Well, I must confess I will watch her departure with mixed emotions. 
MARY: Mine are fairly unmixed. Did you have a clue? Not a clue. How very disappointing. But, in a way, it raises the big question: when do we tell the staff that the end is nigh? It makes it sound so final. I'm afraid it is final. Well, don't spoil Edith's day. Let us get through the wedding first and then tell them afterwards. 
CARSON: Oh, Dr. Clarkson? Do you have a minute? Uh, one minute, yes. Do you mind if we... Only I know that Mrs. Hughes is sfering from a condition and I wondered if there was anything I could do to help. You can help by lessening her duties. That's really all I can say. But you can't tell me how serious it is? I'm afraid not, even if I knew, which I don't, yet. Good day to you, Mr. Carson. And it can't wait until after the wedding? I'm sorry. Of course, you must go. Thank you, m'lady. Right. I think that's everything. Shall we go down? I had a telephone call from Charkham earlier. Charkham? Reggie Swire's lawyer. It seems the death certificate has arrived from India. He wants to bring it here. Well, can't he send it? He wants to bring it. He was quite definite. 

[00:08:29]


(sighs) I've told him he can come tomorrow. There's nothing going on particularly, is there? You know there is. We're taking a picnic to Eryholme to see the house we have to move into. I'm surprised you of all people can forget that. 
(sighs) Well, he's coming in the morning, I won't put him off. 
(exasperated sigh) So this is the moment when you receive a huge fortune that could save Downton, and you give it away. Will you choose where to give it? How can I? I'd give it all to Papa. My darling, I hope, in some small part of you, you can understand. I'm trying. Really, I am. But I can't pretend I'm doing very well. 
(door closes) Will there be anything more, m'lady? No. Unless you have something you want to tell me. What might that be, m'lady? I won't prompt you, O'Brien, if you're not ready to say. Did she tell you why? No. Maybe she doesn't want to until she's settled where she's going, but she has let me down. We should go. Strallan won't be late. He never is, worse luck. Oh, I know you're not happy, but Edith will be in the same county. Loxley is a nice house, and the estate will give her plenty to do. She'll be a nurse, Cora. And by the time she's 50, she'll be wheeling round a one-armed old man. Alfred,do you ever think about that Miss Reed, what was maid to her ladyship's mother? Don't know-- maybe, sometimes. I couldn't get over how outspoken she was. But you liked that, didn't you? I suppose I did. It felt... modern. She said what she felt, even though she was a woman. I did like it. Maybe I should be more outspoken, say what I really think. Are you waiting down here till they come in search of the pudding? Uh, no, Mrs. Patmore. Can I do something for you? Well, I'd better get back upstairs, but, uh, while you're here... I saw Dr. Clarkson today. Oh? I'm worried about Mrs. Hughes. We're all worried, but I don't think he should have told you. He said it would help if we lessened her workload. I'm sure it would, but she won't be pleased he's been talking about her before it's been confirmed. So it is cancer. Not until it's confirmed. Don't say anything. She'd hate to think the doctor had told you. He didn't tell me, Mrs. Patmore. You told me. 

[00:11:24]


(sighs) I must say, it's a relief to have some men in the family at last. Lady Edith... I mean, Edith tells me th're very interested in politics. Well... Tom is our tame revolutionary. Every family should have one. As long as you are tame. Tame enough for a game of billiards. What about it? Can you tell them where we've gone? We're getting used to Tom, and I hope you will too. We haven't spoken, really, since it was all settled. I want you to know that I quite understand why you were against it. Yes. Well... I just hope you believe that I mean to do my level best to make her happy. I do believe that. It was never at all personal, you know. No, of course not, no, it's just because of all this and... I'm far too old. Anthony, the thing is done. There is no point in raking it over. But are you happy about it? I'm happy Edith is happy. I'm happy you mean to keep her happy. That is quite enough happiness to be going on with. 
EDITH: You will let us have five minutes on our own, Papa. Please. Very well. But don't tell your grandmother. I couldn't bear it if we spent the whole evening discussing hunting and whether or not the Marlboroughs are finally getting a divorce. No, no. Are they? Yes. Oh. You know, I first met the Duchess of Marlborough at a ball of Lady Londonderry's, '96. Just after she'd come over from America. She was the loveliest woman I'd ever set eyes on. Of course you weren't even born, my darling. I was. Just not walking very well. Mmm. And before long, you'll be wheeling me around when I can't walk anymore. Please understand, I don't love you in spite of your needing to be looked after. I love you because of it. I want you to be my life's work. There's been a last-minute change of mind about the wedding menus. Couldn't Mrs. Patmore do it? Mrs. Patmore has given me her new order list. She's done her job, it's time for me to do mine. I just don't want you to get tired. Who have you been speaking to? No one. What do you mean? Nothing. I don't mean a thing. Now let me get on. Is baked Alaska a bit ambitious for the dinner after the reception? How many will there be? About 40, I'd say. The rest will have gone home. What is it? Mr. Mason's asked me to the farm. Well, say there's a wedding on. You can go when things have settled down. Now, come and sort out this benighted picnic. Now, this is a simple stitch, but strong and very useful in a drama. When do we get summat to eat? As I was saying, you should start it about, well, I would say about half an inch away from the center line. Oh, I'm glad you've come back. I do hope you've come for our help. You'd be so welcome if you have. You wouldn't say that if you knew what I am, ma'am. I'm past help. Nobody's past help. And if you mean by that that you are a prostitute, well, then you should know that it is true of every woman who has come here to rebuild their lives. And I'm helping them, and I very much hope that I can help you too. That's right, why not come in and help us rebuild our lives? 

[00:15:17]


(women laughing) That's not why I'm here, Mrs. Crawley. That is, I am a... what you said, but I don't want help. Not for myself, but... The trouble is, every time I make up my mind, I change it. I'm sorry, this has been a mistake. Oh please, please, don't go, not again! 
(laughing) It must be strange to receive a letter from a dead man. It's very strange. 
MARY: We're leaving. I'm sorry, Mr. Charkham, to snatch him away. That's quite all right, Lady Mary. There will be papers to sign. Yes, I expect there will. Papa's asked Anthony to meet us t so we can all face the future together. He's bringing Isobel and Granny. It's hard for your grandmother. Matthew, it's torture for all of us. And if I ever look as if I'm finding it easy to lose my home, then I am putting on an act. Are you sure you can manage this? Quite sure, Mr. Carson. There's nothing hot. It's not a shooting lch. Give them some champagne first, and that'll allow you the time to set it out properly. I'll manage, Mr. Carson. What's this place we're visiting? It's one of his lordship's houses, though I'm curious as to why they're going there today. Maybe he likes to keep a check on things. Maybe. 
MATTHEW: We'll see you there! Off you go. 
ROBERT: Mrs. Vanneck, she was a cousin of Granny's. Do you want to come with us? Yes, thank you. Might I have a word, m'la? Yes, of course, what is it? This is a slightly awkward request, what with the wedding tomorrow. Tell me. Mrs. Hughes is very tired. I wonder if it might be possible for you to divert some of her work my way? I don't understand. What do you mean, "tired"? 

[00:17:17]


ROBERT: Cora! Carson? The fact is, Mrs. Hughes is ill, my lady. She may be very ill. I'm extremely sorry to trouble you with this at such a moment, but I don't want the wedding to sink her. Of course not. But, my heavens, how will we manage without O'Brien and now Mrs. Hughes? Miss O'Brien? She told Molesley... Cora, please! I'm coming! 
(baby crying) Mrs. Bartlett? I've... I've brought the money. Well, it's your loss, because I've got nothing to say. All I want to mnow is if Vera ever... Oh! So you were on Christian name terms, were you? You do surprise me. ...if Mrs. Bates ever suggested she was depressed or unhappy? Of course she was unhappy. Her husband had left her and gone off with a trollop. He changed, you know. She was scared of him by the end, and now we know she had good reason. When did you last see her? You'd better come inside. 

[00:19:20]


(whispering): Bates. Psst. Watch out. What do you mean? Search your room, search your bed. They've set you up somehow, your cellmate Craig and his mates. Stop talking! Just do it. 
MRS. BARTLETT: Their door was open, so I looked in. She was cooking, but she had to post a letter, so she walked me down the street. She said Bates was coming back later for his tea. She was terrified. She was in a strange mood-- jumpy and fearful, but determined. remember she'd made pastry and she was scrubbing it out of her nails like she didn't care if she took the skin off. So after she posted the letter, she went home on her own? She did, poor soul. And I never saw her after. I can remember her now, walking away down the street. It was raining. No, not raining, more like drizzle. And the gaslight seemed to catch in the drops and make a sort of halo round her. A halo? Really? You can laugh. When did you hear she was dead? Next day. So I knew it was Bates. When I heard the verdict, I thought he'd swing. And he should have, if the country hadn't gone soft. 
(sobbing) 
VIOLET: This is very good of you. Oh, nonsense, you were on the way. I do wish you'd let me sit in the front. No, no, I prefer it. I've ridden in the front seat many times. Aren't you a wild thing! Oh, it's quite safe. There's never been a safer method of travel. Nor a faster one. Edith's the speed fiend. She likes to go at a terrific lick. Do you think you'll be able to keep up with her? I'll try. What's this place like? Eryholme, is it? Do you know it? Well, a little. My late husband kept the shooting there, and we'd sometimes have luncheon in the house. Is it nice? Nice enough, as a retreat from the world. I wouldn't have thought it suited to much else. Downton Place. How lovely. Won't it be a bit cramped? You do realize that for most people it looks like a fairy palace? 

[00:22:00]


SYBIL: You'll be able to run it with a much smaller staff. 
ROBERT: This is it. I doubt we'll need more than eight servants tops, so it'll be very economical. What about me? Where am I to go? We still own most of the village. Oh. Perhaps I could open a shop. Good idea, Granny. What do you think Eryholme needs? Well, if it's like everywhere else, good manners and some decent conversation. Well, there you are, then. You should have a roaring trade in minutes. 
(all chuckling) How's everything going? Very well, I think. I think it's rather unfair that Mary should have an archbishop to marry her and you've got poor old Mr. Travis. Oh, I don't mind. It was such short notice and he was all booked up. And I prefer it, really, to have the man who christened us. What had Charkham come for? He gave me a letter from Swire. It seems he left one for each of the three potential heirs, when and if they inherited. Mine is the only one to have been delivered. And what did it say? I haven't opened it. I can't decide whether I will. Why wouldn't you? Because I know it will be a paean of praise. How Lavinia could not have found a better man, et cetera. And you don't want to read that? Since she could not have found a worse one, no, I don't. I already feel bad enough, and if I read his words, they will stay with me forever. 
(kitchen utensils clattering nearby) Mrs. Crawley? We're back from our delicious luncheon, and, um, I was on my way home... You had a maid at Downton, Ethel Parks. I was here when she brought her son into the dining room. Who could forget that? Do you have an address for her? I do, if she's still there. You see... You see, I saw her this morning. And I'm afraid she's fallen into a bad way, a very bad way. Oh, dear. I am sorry to hear that. If you'd like to come with me, I'll fetch it for you. Thank you. 

[00:24:33]


(keys jangling) 
(door opening) Get up, both of you! Against the wall! Mr. Turner, search the bunk, please! Nothing here. What? Clean this mess up! Bastards. There's a lot of bastards in here. I expect you're tired. It's a long day, up to London and back again. Was it worth the journey? Not really. 
CARSON: Miss O'Brien, might I ask what you've confided in Mr. Molesley but have kept from the rest of us? I don't know what you mean. Mr. Molesley appears to have given her ladyship the impression that you are planning a change of some sort. What's this? I... I'm sorry. I thought her ladyship would know. Know what? That you're leaving. I beg your pardon! How dare you make such an assumption? Isn't it time for the dressing gong, Mr. Carson? It certainly is. Thank you. But... Excuse me, Mr. Molesley. I've got work to do, even if you haven't. I'll deal with you later. You're in the soup. I wouldn't be in her bad books for a gold clock. You must have said something Molesley misinterpreted. But I don't say anything to him, m'lady, beyond "pass the salt" and "get out of the way." There must have been something. I'm afraid I do feel let down, O'Brien, I really do, and right on top of the wedding... 

[00:26:57]


(knocking at the door) You sent for me, m'lady? Yes. Thank you, O'Brien. Mrs. Hughes, I understand that you're not well. Whom do you understand that from? Because if the doctor... It wasn't Dr. Clarkson. It is not confirmed that I am ill, your ladyship. I've had a test and I'm waiting for the results. But I am perfectly capable... Mrs. Hughes, I only want to say one thing; that if you are ill, you are welcome here for as long as you want to stay. Lady Sybil will help us to find a suitable nurse. I see. I don't want you to have any concerns about where you'll go or who will look after you because the answer is here and we will. I don't know what to say, m'lady. There isn't anything more to say until we know where we stand, one way or the other. Thank you. If they complain it's dull, tell them it's a miracle there's cheese at all the day before a wedding. I'll send for you and you can tell them. You said you wanted to be more outspoken. That's not quite what I meant. Alfred, get that cheese up, come on! He thinks I don't know, but of course I do. We'll spend two weeks in Rome, then Florence, then Venice, so I couldn't be happier. And what about Loxley? Is there masses to be done? It's not too bad. It's not too bad downstairs. The bedrooms are killers. Well, don't do anything too fast. It takes time to know how a house works. I really think you should go to bed. No bride wants to look tired at her wedding. It either means she's anxious or been up to no good. I won't sleep a wink. Tonight or tomorrow. Sybil, vulgarity is no substitute for wit. Well, you started it. 
(giggling) I think you have to read it. I don't agree. It's like when someone you love dies. Don't look at them dead if you don't want that image in your brain forever, because it'll never leave you. What about if I read it? I think I should burn the damn thing. 

[00:29:14]


MOLESLEY: Miss O'Brien? Please understand that I didn't mean any harm. Well, why make it up in the first place? I didn't make it up, I was told. Who told you? Well, Mr. Barrow mentioned it, but I think it was an honest mistake. No, it wasn't honest and it wasn't a mistake. But don't worry about it. I can tell it wasn't your fault, Mr. Molesley. So we'll forget about it, shall we? And when you see Mr. Barrow, you can tell him that I may make some honest mistakes myself in the future. Why not sit down and eat with us? Oh, I couldn't do that. 
CARSON: Daisy will not sit down because the invitation is not in your gift, Alfred. She eats with Mrs. Patmore in the kitchen. 
ALFRED: Fancy a game of something later? Daisy's busy. Anna? I want to write a letter. Sorry. I'll play. Let's see how we feel. 
MATTHEW: What do you mean you've read it? I didn't think it was right to destroy a man's last words without reading them. I felt it was wrong. It wasn't your decision! Well, I made it my decision! Do you want to hear what he says? No. To start with, Lavinia must have written to him on her last day, only hours before she died. That's nonsense, there was no letter found in her room. Be that as it may, she wrote to him after she tried to persuade you to call off the wedding and you wouldn't. This is quite impossible. 
(exasperated sigh) "She loved and admired you "for this sacrifice of your own happiness, and she commended you to my care." I can't listen to any more of this. You must! "I have few intimates "and so I've decided in her name to add you to my list of heirs. "I think it unlikely that I'll outlive both the first two, "so there is little chance of your reading this letter, "but if you do, and if the money has come to you, "know it is with my full knowledge of what transpired. "Please do not allow any grief, guilt or regret "to hold you back in its employment. "God bless you, my boy. Reggie." Are you sure you didn't write it? I assume you know his hand. enough to test a forgery. Besides, she couldn't have written to him without our knowing. I'm not accusing you of faking it, but I suspect someone has. So it won't change your mind? Not yet it won't. 

[00:32:04]


(knocking at the door) Time you were in bed. It's a big dayrow. I'll just finish this. Is it something I can do for you? No. Did you say anything about me to her ladyship? I don't know what you mean. Why? Don't worry. She was very kind, and I was touched. As you know, I don't worship them all, like you do. I wouldn't put it like that. But this time, I freely admit it, I was quite touched. 
(birds chirping) Ah. I'll change for the wedding after luncheon. Very good, m'lord. Did it surprise you when you heard O'Brien might be on the move? Not really, m'lord. She's always been a dark horse. It seems she's changed her mind, but I dare say we'd recover if she went. Oh yes, it'd take a lot more than that torive us out of Downton. Am I interrupting? No, please. I just want to ask you all something. M'lady, I'm sorry I've not been up. Don't worry, I'll change properly after luncheon. But I had to catch you when you were all together. How can we help, m'lady? It's a funny thing. Mr. Crawley has heard that Miss Swire sent a letter on the day she died. If so, someone must have posted it for her, and we wondered if it were any of you? 
CARSON: I'm afraid not. Given that the poor lady passed away that same day, an incident of this sort would have been reported to me or to Mrs. Hughes. That's right, m'lady. I see. Well, thank you very much. What were that about? 

[00:34:22]


ANNA: Lady Mary wanted to know if anyone had posted a letter for Miss Swire. Oh, I did that. 
CARSON: Daisy? What did you say? Poor Miss Swire's letter. She'd written it and she asked me to put it into the box in the hall. Why? at were you doing in her room? Making up the fire. We started talking and she said she'd written a letter. She was ever so nice. I still get sad when I think about her. And it didn't occur to you to tell me? Tell you what? Never mind. I am grateful to you, Daisy. You cannot know how much. Well, this is the last of them. I'm glad they've hurried it so she can be married from Downton. Are you? I should have thought a little sober reflection uld not have gone amiss. Mama, let's try to be positive. Of all of them, Anthony Strallan is the most traditional choice. Robert, Edith is beginning her life as an old man's drudge. I should not have thought a large drawing room much compensation. Why dwell on that now? Because I want the pleasure of saying I told you so. I don't think so. One of the maids will supervise the oven and Alfred's sent to manage the wine. It's a shame they have to miss it. 
MRS. PATMORE: Not really; they've not been here long enough to know Lady Edith. Now, the moment you feel tired you're to tell me and I'll take over whatever it is you're doing. Oh, will you, now? Are you sure you want to come to the church? You could stay here and have a lie down. It would be so nice if people would wait to learn if I really am ill before boxing me up. I don't know what you mean. I don't know anything about any illness. Don't you? I see. Who told him? I don't know. Maybe he just picked it up somehow. He's worried about you. He's a good man. He's a hopeless liar. Well, that's quite nice really, isn't it? I've had a message from the doctor. He'll have the results tomorrow. I'm to call in the afternoon. Try not to worry. I'll try, but I won't succeed. 

[00:36:51]


(door opens) That's it. I'll put the hat on later. Go straight to Lady Edith. You look marvelous. I feel marvelous. That is, I feel marvelous because we don't have to leave Downton. Lavinia did write to her father and it was posted from this house. In otherds, every word Mr. Swire wrote in that letter was true. Daisy posted it, the kitchen maid. I see. Do you, my darling? I hope so, because if you try to find one more excuse not to accept the money, I'll have to beat you about the head. 
(laughs) e. 
(sighs) I do have one condition, however. Make it a good one. Let's not steal Edith's thunder. I'll tell Robert after it's over and she's left on honeymoon. Now, that I can live with. You look beautiful. All of us married, all of us happy. And the first baby on the way. Why don't we get the photographer to take a picture of the three of us when we get to the church? He looks as if he's waiting for a beating from the headmaster. Do you think I should reassure him? How? He's done it before, so he must be in possession of all the facts. Perhaps the first Lady Strallan was a difficult act to follow. Or a difficult one to repeat. 
(flash explodes) Well, fashionably late is one thing... We're going in. Edith, I know we haven't always got along and I doubt things change much in the future, but today I wish you all the luck in the world. Thank you. 

[00:39:10]


(sighs happily) Thank you very much. 
(organ playing processional) Good afternoon. Good afternoon, my sweet one. 
(music stops) Dearly beloved, we are gathered... I can't do this. What? I can't do it. You know it's wrong. You told me so yourself several times. My dear chap... No. I never should have let it get this far. I should have stopped it long ago. I tried to stop it. What are you saying? I don't understand what you're saying. Edith... Edith, I can't let you throw away your life like this. What do you mean? We're so happy, aren't we? We're going to be so terribly, terribly happy. 
STRALLAN: But you are going to be happy. I pray that you are. But only if you don't waste yourself on me. Anthony, it is too late for this. Might I suggest we all take a step back? No, let him go, let him go. You know he's right. Don't stop him doing the only sensible thing he's come up with in months. Thank you, Lady Grantham. But Granny... No, no, it's over, my dear, don't drag it out. Wish him well and let him go. I can't. Good-bye, my dearest darling. And may God bless you. Always. 

[00:41:33]


(sobbing) 
(guests murmuring) 
(crying) 
(crying) When everyone gets back, can you clear all this away? I want it gone before Lady Edith comes downstairs. Flowers, glasses, everything. And ask the outside staff to help put back the carpet and the furniture. Yes, m'lord. 
(door opens) 
(sobbing) Is there anything I could say to make it better? No. Look at them. Both with their husbands, Sybil pregnant, Mary probably pregnant. Oh, just go. I mean it. Go. Perhaps you should go. Oh, Mama... You are being tested. And do you know what they say, my darling? Being tested only makes you stronger. I don't think it's working with me. 

[00:43:36]


(sobbing) What should we do now? There's nothing we can do, beyond removing all signs of a wedding and holding her hand while she recovers. She will, of course. Meanwhile, it's time to face the business of leaving Downton. Without the wedding to hide behind, there's no reason not to get on with it and astonish the world with the extent of my wretched failure. Actually... Mary and I intended to make an announcement at dinner. What announcement? What about? You don't have to leave. I'll explain it later, but I'm going to give you Reggie's money. I'll accept it, and I'll give it to you. Don't be silly. You're not going to give me any money. But I am. You don't want to leave. Nor does Mary. Nor do any of us, for that matter. I still won't take your money. What I will allow is for you to invest in the place. If we stay, you'll share the ownership. It'll be your house, your estate, as much as mine. We will be joint Masters. But... And if you won't agree, I will sell and it'll all be your fault. 

[00:45:48]


(sighs with relief) I never thought I'd feel sorry for an earl's daughter. All God's creatures have their troubles. Anna? Yes? Do you think it's right that women should say what they think? Speak out about romance and everything? Well, things are changing for us. And the vote won't be long now. So I suppose they must get used to us speaking our minds, but... But what? With most of the men I've ever met, if you started to court them, they'd be so terrified, they'd run a mile. Has she had something to eat? Anna took up some sandwiches... but she didn't touch a thing. That reminds me. Carson, I don't want Lady Edith to see any of the wedding food. Mrs. Hughes and Anna are taking what's left down to Mr. Travis tomorrow, m'lady. For the poor. If the poor don't want it, you can bring it over to me. How can we help Edith? You can help her by finding her something to do. 
ALFRED: Is this all we're getting? Just these picketty bits? Hardly. These are canap??s, Alfred. For your first course, some truffled egg on toast, perhaps? Some oysters a la Russe? Then what? There's lobster rissoles in Mousseline sauce or Calvados-glazed duckling, or do you fancy a little asparagus salad with champagne-saffron vinaigrette? When I think how you've gone to such pains... Never mind me. What about the pain of that poor girl upstairs? 

[00:47:53]


O'BRIEN: Jilted at the altar. I don't think I could stand the shame. Then it's lucky no one's ever asked you, isn't it? 
ANNA: Poor thing. How will she find the strength to hold up her head? 
DAISY: I swear I'd have to run away and hide in a place where no one knew me. I think she's well outf it. How can you say that? I mean it. She's young, she's not bad looking. She could do much better than that broken down old crock. 
CARSON: Sir Anthony may have betrayed a daughter of this house, but he still does not deserve to be addressed in that manner by a footman. 
MRS. HUGHES: Oh, I think he does, Mr. Carson. Every bit of that and worse. Well, maybe just this once. Right. What's it to be? Lobster, duck or asparagus? Is there any cheese, Mrs. Patmore? 
(door opens) What would you like me to get you? A different life. Let me bring you up some breakfast. No. I am a useful spinster, good at helping out. That is my role. And spinsters get up for breakfast. 
(knock at the door) Going out? Just into the viage. I have to fetch something. Can I help? I'm going down later. No, thank you. This is an errand I have to do for myself. Ready? As ready as I'll ever be. We can be sure of one thing: I won't be cured by standing here. D'ywu want... No. Everything all right, Miss O'Brien? Oh, yes. Everything's all right with me, but it'll be all wrong with you before too long. Mark my words. Oh? And how is that, Miss O'Brien? I don't know. Not yet. But it will be. You can be sure of it. Hello, Ethel. How did you find me? I asked Mrs. Hughes. I would so like to help you. Please. Won't you let me? You don't understand, Mrs. Crawley. I didn't come looking for help, not for myself. I'm past all that. Why did you come? 

[00:52:24]


(baby babbling) I've got to go. Thanks for trying, ma'am, but there's no point. It's all up with me, I'm done. Well? Is it or isn't it? It's not cancer, no. It's a benign something-or-other, nothing more. 
(relieved sigh) Don't mention that you've said anything. She doesn't know that I know. I won't say a word. Did you tell him? I would prefer to say I put him out of his misery. 
(singing) 
CARSON: ?????? Dashing away with the smoothing iron ?????? ?????? She stole my heart away ?????? ?????? Dashing away with the smoothing iron ?????? ?????? Dashing away with the smoothing iron ?????? ?????? Dashing away with the smoothing iron ?????? ?????? She stole my heart away. ?????? 
(chuckling) 
LINNEY: Next time... 
ANNA: I haven't had a letter from Mr. Bates in weeks. I worry he wants me to make a new life without him. Am I to answer to you both? I have made an investment in the estate, that is all. Where's Sybil? You abandon a pregnant woman in a land that's not her own while you run for it? Other men have normal families. No family is ever what it seems from the outside. 
SYBIL: There's no time to talk, but tell them I'm all right. Sybil? Hello?

=======================================================

>>> From washington, "the McLAUGHLIN GROUP," THE AMERICAN Original. For over three decades, in part by american petroleum institute. 
>>> As a congressional staffer IN THE 1980s HE HELPED Negotiate the deal between president reagan and tip o'neill to save social security. Under president clinton, he presided over three budget surpluses in a row. So for all the talk out there about deficit reduction, making sure our books are balanc, this is the guy who did it. Three times. 
>> The white house chief of staff, jack lew, was nominated by the president this week to replace outgoing treasury secretary timothy geithner. Lew is a democratic veteran of washington, 30 years of service. Currently he is president obama's chief of staff. Earlier lew served as his budget director, and in that job he raised republican hackles. In fact, jeff sessions of alabama, the ranking republican on the senate budget committee, has already said he will try to block mr. Lew's confirmation, notably over a statement lew made two years ago. Lew was then omb, office of management and budget director. "Our budget will get us over the next several years to the point where we can look the each year." Speaking to this, senator sessions had this to say. "To look the american people in the eye and make such a statement remains the most direct and important false assertion during ng my entire time in washington, unquote. 

[00:03:09]


>> Question is jacob lew a shoe- in for treasury secretary or does president obama have a fight on his hand? 
>> I don't know if you would call him a shoe-in. He is going to be touched up a bit by the republicans but he is going to be confirmed. Does obama have a fight object his hands? You bet, but the fight is going to be over chuck hagel for secretary of defense. That is going to be a proxy battle between what you might call the know 0-conservatives, THE BUSH II FOLKS, McCAIN, Lieberman, lindsey graham, and the others and what hagel stands for, john, is non- interventionist foreign policy. We don't go to war unless vital interests are at stake. We put our own country first. I think this is going to be the battle royal in the coming months. 
>> Eleanor. 
>> Nobody is a shoe-in with the republican party that fails to defeat president obama for reelection but still seems determined to make him a failed president but jacob lew is as close to a shoe-in as there can be. The only complaint you hear is that he sn't spent enough time on wall street, and for a lot of democrats that's actually a positive attribute. So he will be confirmed. And I believe senator hagel will also be confirmed, although that's a bigger fight, and his remarks about israel that somehow he isn't tough enough on israel, his objection to sanctions was that they were unilateral. He now supports the current sanctions. He is certainly not antiisrael. Those arguments will be put aside. He is there to cut the budget, and he's the man for the moment. He has the appetite to do that. 
>> So this prospective appointment is bypassing wall street. Is that good play by obama? 
>> Well, in the first four years of the -- of his administration, the first term, his great job was to keep the financial sector from collapsing. So he had someone intimately familiar in tim geithner with wall street. In the second four years his great job is balancing fiscal issues, and he has in jack lew somebody who, as eleanor said, knows the budget up and down, tremendous respect, a great negotiator. Keep in mind, jack lew is something that people don't understand. He is a liberal fiscal hawk. He's a liberal deficit hawk. He's got very strong views on the safety net and funding of government but he really does believe in doing what can be done to reduce deficits ?Ee.'S coming at that time beginning of president obama's second term. Second terms are rough. They eventually lead into lake duckery. People jump ship who are working for him. Sew needs a strong group to handle the deficiencies that are inherent in a second term. You understand me? 

[00:06:03]


>> I understand. I think that's right. 
>> Now, is lew the guy that can do this for him? Can he protect him and keep him alive in the sense of politically alive, of course, and keep him vibrant as president? 
>> Look, up to a degree, he can do that. But ultimately still most of the major policy is at the desk of the president. When he said that he was the man who was responsible for three surpluses under bill clinton, let me tell you, bill clinton had three different programs to reduce the budget deficit and bring about that. So it was a presidential decision. It's not the decision of the budget director. Having said that he is widely recognized as being outstanding budget director. He is not widely recognized for understanding the world of finance or knowing the people in the world of finance but let's hope we don't have another financial crisis, although with the kind of deficits we are running, we are vulnerable to a financial crisis. 
>> But he appears to be a person you can rely on. 
>> Yes, without question. He knows the budget, as people say, inside and out. He's a very solid guy. His word is taken at its face value, and he knows how to deal on 1. New york university, executive vice president and coo. That means pryears, 2010 to 20 126789 he's been chief of staff for this year. I guess last year and this year, and that's about it. 
>> We have our own wikipedia here on the set. 

[00:08:03]


>> We all want to be introduced to this guy. Do you want to say anything about lew before we go on to hagel? 
>> Go to hagel. 
>> I'm very glad to welcome you back. This is your washington monthly. I must commend you on this terrific magazine devoted to a large extent on what sprang from the career of abraham lincoln, raised history in obama's second term. Good luck with the 150th anniversary of the emancipation proclamation. 
>> Thank you. 
>> I commend you. this. Okay. Hag gel over hagel. 
>> He would be the first person of enlisted rank to serve as secretary of defense. One of the few secretaries who have been wounded in war, and the first vietnam veteran to lead the department. 
>> President obama announced this week his choice for secretary of defense. Former two-term senator from nebraska, chuck hagel. Get this. Unlike president obama, the democrat, hagel is a republican. Hagel voted for the war in iraq in 2003. Senator hagel became a vocal critic of the war's management. Also, israel backers are incensed by senator hagel's words really israel. Hagel said, "the jewish lobby intimidates a lot of people up here. Not an israeli senator." Republican senator lindsey graham is no fan of chuck hagel. 
>> Chuck hagel, if confirmed to be secretary of defense, would be the most an tag aning to antagonistic. He has said not only must we negotiate with hamas this is an in your face nomination to all of us who are supportive of israel. 

[00:10:16]


>> Anti-hagel television ads are now airing. 
>> While president obama says all options are on the table for prevent ago nuclear iran, hagel says military action is not a viable, feasible responsible option. President obama, secretary of defense chuck hagel is not a responsible option. 
>> Question. Would president obama have nominated hagel if president obama truly believed that hagel was anti-israel? Pat. 
>> No, he would not. And hagel is not anti-israel. What he is, he puts his own country first, and he's tired of these resolutions the israeli lobby brings up and tells him to sign on. This is a gay, john, who has fought for his country and bled for his country and puts his own country first. He does believe in this. Like nixon, like ike, like reagan, like bush i, he believes in talking to our adversaries and enemies. That includes cuba, iran, hezbollah, and I don't know how you prevent a war unless you talk to both sides. 
>> That's what candidate obama said in 2008. These two men are very much in sync. I'm not the first to say this, this is really a band of brothers. The president, vice president biden, john kerry secretary of state is and chuck hagel, if they're all confirmed, they all served together on the senate foreign relations committee. So they really know each other, and they are in sync in a way that I don't think we've seen a team like this before. This isn't a team of rivals. 
>> Beginning to sound like good ol' boys. By the way, where are the women in this administration forth coming? 
>> Hillary is gone. 
>> There's valerie, john. Leave it alone. 
>> Solis is leaving. 
>> Can I finish? 
>> Yeah. 
>> Hillary is gone. All the other jobs were occupied by white man. I don't think this president feels the compulsion to look like a benatante. If the republicans want to argue that the president's cabinet isn't diverse enough, have at it. 

[00:12:33]


>> Did you see the group with obama with the sleeves rolled up? They were all boys. Out of 14 or 15 people gathered around. Not one woman. 
>> I think valerie jarratt's leg was in there. 
>> She was not. 
>> She actually functions as chief of staff. If anybody questions where the center of power is in the white house, a lot of it is around valerie jarratt. 
>> So you think the gripes by feminist groups -- 
>> I understand the disappointment but they're not going to be disappointed in the end. 
>> Thoughts on this, mort? The subject is hagel. 
>> I feel I'd much rather talk about women, but if you insist, I'll talk about hagel. Look, I think he's a very well respected senator. The point about it is, I think implicit in what was just referred to, obama is very comfortable with him. The major appointments are people he's very comfortable with and knows well personally, and I think that's the kind of person he wants to surround himself for his second term. 
>> Now, you know netanyahu. This is not privileged information, but what conclusions would you draw from a hagel nomination? Netanyahu might conclude the u.S. Is not serious about keeping open the option of a pre-emptive strike. Do you hear me on that? 
>> I think netanyahu knows exactly what his problems are in that part of the world, and he will do his best to deal with them without going to war. Doesn't mean he has an eauy hand to play but he also is going to have to deal with this administration which probably is not the most friendly administration to the israelis that he's had to deal with, but that's his challenge. He's got to find a way to deal with both the critical threats that israel is facing, and an administration that doesn't really believe there should be force used in this whole process. 
>> Exit question. 
>> I don't know that anyone thinks force should be used. It's a last resort. 
>> There are people in this city that do think force should be used. 
>> Paul, do you have thoughts on this? 

[00:14:34]


>> This is a great debate to have. Chuck hagel, putting him out there forces washington to grapple with budget cuts on defense and how to do them right so that we cut but don't run, and he's the perfect foil for that. He will be, I think, elected, appointed. 
>> He will put the debate right on -- I think a good debate is should we really go to war with iran, and under what circumstances. We really ought to have it all out before that decision is made, and I think the hagel nomination is the place to do it. 
>> Is there any doubt in your mind that we have practically sworn as a nation be an ally with israel, as israel is with us? 
>> The american people, the whole country believes that israel is a friend and ally of the united states. I was with nixon. He rescued israel even though they weren't a formal ally. People believe that but they disagree on the agenda of netanyahu. 
>> Sought doesn't mean we are unaqifly allied with or support the programs of netanyahu. 
>> That's been true of every israeli prime minister. Not every policy of every prime minister was supported by the united states. That's where the prime minister of israel better make sure that he knows where the united states is coming from, and i suspect that this president is not going to abandon israel. 
>> We've got to get -- 
>> clarify what I said. The president and the obama administration does not want to use forcing a gains iran. But that option is e two. Gun control. National and state. 
>> There is nothing that has pricked the consciousness of the american people, there's nothing that has gone to the heart of the matter more than the visual image people have of little six-year-old kids riddled -- not shot with a stray bullet, riddled, riddled, with bullet holes in their classroom. And the public demands we speak to the. 

[00:16:43]


>> This week in the wake of the shooting in newtown, connecticut, that left 20 elementary school children and six adults massacred, vice president joe biden and president obama's request, led a task force to address the broad, sensitive, and inflammatory issue of gun control. Gun groups like the national rifle association, presented views to the biden task force which has addressed specific proposals. Notably, reinstate the assault weapons ban that expired in 2004 and close loopholes. Quire standardized universal criminal background checks and mental health background checks at gun shows and through private dealers. Support for what the obama- biden team is doing at the federal level was echoed by governor cuomo in new york, on and for the state level. 
>> Set an example for the rest of the nation. Let them look at new york and say, this is what you can do! Pass reasonable gun control in the state of new york! And I say to you, forget the extremists. It's simple. No one hunts with an assault rifle. No one needs 10 bullets to kill a deer! End the madness now! 
>> The point of governor cuomo's plan, single standards for background checks, notably to bar convicted felons. Ban large capacity ammunition clips. Ten rounds or more. Regardless of manufacture date. Strengthen penalties for illegal gun carriers or for those who carry guns on school property or those engaged in violent activity. Confiscate guns from owners deemed dangerous by mental health professionaline fit tons own a firearm. Do you think governor cuomo -- I say this respectfully -- waking up in the middle of the night hearing "hail to the chief"? Do you think this is an indication of what his plans are four years from now to run for president? 

[00:19:00]


>> I can't imagina new york governor thinking some day he might be president. It's beyond my imagination, john, but I'll make the adjustment if I have to answer your question. Yes, he does. 
>> What did you think of what he said? 
>> Listen, he's going toget this through. He igoing to get a big change in gun control through new york state. He's got the capability to do it, he knows how to handle his legislative body. I think he is going to get it through. And it will set an example for the rest of the country which in my view is long overdue. 
>> Do you think this is going to become normative, this approach of governor cuomo, where he's insisting on gun control? Will it be normative for the other 49 states? 
>> It's happening in colorado, in illinois where they're tightening up. 
>> Why do you say just democratic states? 
>> Well, I don't know that there's too many republican states that are going the same 
-- 
>> yeah, but a lot has transpired. 
>> I know a lot has transpired. It will not get through. 
>> Even today? 
>> It won't get through to the congress of the united states, in my view. Dianne feinstein is going to grandfather in all of these assault weapons already in people's hands. One million, john, are on back order. Sales of these bushmaster things, these armalite rifles, have doubled in the last month. This whole campaign that turned around and focused on it has boosted gun sales. 
>> Let eleanor in. 
>> That's such a facetious argument what. You're saying, they're all out there so therefore we can't stop going forward. 
>> The reality is you are not going to get gun confiscation, so they can only do something going forward, but aside from just banning the sale of assault weapons, you can, as you pointed out in the setup, ban the sale of these large magazines. If you are a sportsman, you do not need 10 shots to kill a deer. You're a lousy shot. So this sun necessary, and most sportsmen and members of the nra -- 

[00:21:05]


>> another point, criminologists will point out it is new guns that criminals like. They don't like guns stored in people's houses. Most guns that wind up in gun crimes are new guns. Anything you start now is going to have a positive effect. 
>> The payback -- 
>> let pat in. 
>> Half the people who own these armalite rifles are cops and veterans. Also you get kids watching these videos, and all of these movies, they see these guns roman romantacized. When has barack obama says, i don't want any guy in my cabinet who doesn't -- 
>> this point is well taken. Portrait aggression plays a real role in the psyche of younger people, and older people, too. 
>> It doesn't justify it. 
>> We should watch our motion pictures and our television and other entertainment operations, the video games. 
>> All the more reason why we should control the distribution of guns, the sale of guns 
>>> issue three. Assad's call to arms. 
>> Syria's present, bashar al- assad issued a call for a quote unquote total national mobilization. To defeat syrian nationals rebelling against him. The conflict is nearly two years old. It is estimated to have killed more than 60,000 people. Assad's speech hammered home how far out of reach a political answer is to the civil war now raging. The u.N., By the way, is describing the hostility as a civil war. Assad was addressing an audience of loyalists in the opera house in central e e e e e e e e e e importance of total mobilization. "Syria will only exit this calamity by converting this energy into a total national mobilization to save the country from the clutches of a crisis that has no precedent in this region." The address marked president assad's first address to the nation in more than six months. He denies there was a popular uprising against his family's rule. Now in he called the conflict and insurgency a handful of syrians and many foreigners, terrorists holding the views of al qaeda. They call themselves jihaddists and we are fighting them, unquote. Assad also called for a national dialogue that would include, quote, all elements of syrian society, unquote. Rebels have taken over significant territory but to date have not been able to break assad's regime's grip on most of the main cities. 

[00:24:01]


>> I think we -- 
>> question. The u.N. Says that the current conflict in syria is the u.N. Foreign intervention? A civil war. 
>> John, here's the point. The united states is going to the security council, and we've been blocked by the russians and the chinese. We have no authorization there. We have no nato authorization as of now. Frankly the americans and the israelies and the others are getting cold feet on the idea of assad going down because the people who are really rising in this revolution are jihaddists who are coming in from all over the world now, into syria, and also syria, the government there, has done a better job than people expected. People thought it was going to be gone, and they've done a better job of holding the cities and are maintaining it. 
>> What do you think of that, mort? 
>> I don't think anybody really has a clear idea of what's going on, on the ground. I was with one of the journalists who just came back from syria. He says that country is in turmoil. The existing government has a certain amount of control over arms and military force in that part of the world, but it's eroding at a very rapid rate, and there's going to be chaos. It seems to me what we have to do is to find a way to deal with the chaos and to find someone we can support who will succeed assad. 
>> You know the chemical weapon worries. It was connected to assad. The bigger chemical weapon worries is that if the rebels take over that government, they will have the possible usage of chemical weapons if an uprising rises against them. You follow me? Is that a more likely scenar, scenario two? What am I trying to say? Is it more justification for worry, number two, as opposed to number one? 
>> The issue is, we're going to stand by and do nothing, okay, the chances are that a rebel group will take over, and who knows what they will do. 
>> Who wants them to have -- 

[00:26:02]


>> we don't want them to have chemical weapons. We don't want assad to have chemical wessments and the whole world has warned assad against the use of chemical weapons. If he does use it he will be over. 
>> But is there now a lessening of the worry that assad will use the chemical weapons? 
>> I think we never know what assad will do to. Answer your question, does the civil war justify it, if we want to justify it, 
>>> out of time. Sorry.

Introducing new secret clinical strength stress response scent. 
>>> From nbc news in washington, the world's longest running television program, this is "meet the press" with david gregory. 
>>> Good sunday morning. The president's nominee to lead the defense department, former senator chuck hagel is under intense scrutiny and he as the white house try to push back against critics of his foreign policy views. This morning, someone who supports the hagel nomination, the former secretary of state, general colin powell, here to speak exclusively to us. General powell, good morning, welcome back to the program. 
>> Good morning, david. Good to be here. 
>> I want to start on chuck hagel. Why do you think he should be confirmed? 
>> Ink there are a number of reasons. First, I think he has had a very, very distinguished public service record that he can stand on. There are a lot of comments about different things he said over the years and I think he will have a chance to respond to all those comments as the confirmation hearings. But it might be useful just to stand back and take a look at this man overall a young man who volunteered to go to vietnam. They wanted to send him to europe, a nice, safe, place, he wanted to go to vietnam. He and his brother went. They were both wounded, he was wounded twice. Came back to vietnam, went to school on the gi bill, veterans administration. From there went to other things in life. He supported president reagan in his run for office and as a result of that, he received an appointment as deputy director of the veterans administration to show you the kind of courage this guy has and what he believes in he quit after one year because he felt the veterans administration was not doing a good job for veterans answered couldn't take that went back to private life. Started a cellular company. In those days, it was something rather remarkable and new. Made a fortune. Did very, very well. And he continued to serve. And while he was running that cellular company, he also was president of the uso, which was in trouble. So this is a guy who knows veterans, knows the troops, knows the uso. And when people say, well that doesn't necessarily make him a good candidate for secretary of defense, I will tell you who thinks that makes him a good candidate for secretary of defense, the men and women in the armed forces of the united states and their parents who know that this is a guy who will be very careful about putting their lives at risk, 'cause he put his life at risk. He know what is war is and he will fight a wars if the's necessary but a guy that will do it with great deliberation and care. Beyond that he went back to nebraska, ran for senate. Became a senator. Said he would only serve two terms. Only served two terms. And when he was elected the second time, he was elected with 83% of the vote. This is a guy respected by his fellow citizens of nebraska. Served here for a total of 12 years. And what did he do when he left the senate? He became an academic in georgetown, school of foreign service, teaching the new leaders. He also has been co-chairman of the president's intelligence advisory board. He is also on the defense policy board. This is a gentleman who knows all of these issues in depth. He is a fellow who speaks his mind. He sometimes gets in trouble with those who think he should not speak his mind but he says what he believes and he sticks with it. So the issues that are being raised now are important issues and that's why we have a confirmation hearing and I'm sure that chuck will be able to deal with those issues at the hearing. 

[00:03:19]


>> Let's go through a few of them. 
>> All right. 
>> On iran, he has been criticized for his views, he failed to label iran's revolutionary guard a terror organization, advocated direct talks with iran which have not borne fruit and as advocated taking force off the table when dealing with iran. Steve hayes in the weekly standard wrote nothing something in his blog this week, which i will put on the screen., Which i will put on the screen. How would he advise this president on how to overcome the threat? 
>> First of all, I don't think that is a correct assessment. Chuck hagel said nothing is off the table but one of the things he believes in is prospects for negotiation. We have been ready to negotiate under the right set of circumstances with iran for the last several years with our friends and allies so, force is the table but I'm glad we have people like the president and like chuck hagel who will be very careful when you start throwing around the terms -- 
>> he says it's not feasible. Do you agree it is not feasible. 
>> What is the not feasible? 
>> Military option? 
>>> Military option is always feasible, you tell me what the option is. Are we going to blow up tehran or go after facilities that might be well protected or hidden? And I think bob gates, the previous secretary of defense, who pointed out the difficulty of striking these places is a real one. So any military option is feasible in terms of dropping bombs but what is the result of that military attack? With respect to the revolutionary guard, he has reasons for why he didn't go along with that resolution at the time and that will be explored in the confirmation hearings. The last three weeks, we have had dueling op eds, dueling blogs and dueling different groups coming forward but most of the national security community in retirement that i know and many of the secretaries of defense and state I know, national security advisers, distinguished ambassadors, who served in the middle east think that chuck hagel is a solid guy who speaks his mind. He's a good supporter of israel. He has been there and the record will show that but he is not reluctant to disagree when he thinks disagreement is appropriate. 

[00:05:32]


>> You brought up israel. He referred to a jewish lobby saying it intimidates a lot of people on capitol hill what kind of thinking does that reflect? Can you understand pro-israel senators being concerned by that comment? 
>> They shouldn't be that concerned that term slips out from time to time. There was an article this week that the israeli newspaper, haaretz, occasionally used the same thing. So, chuck should have said israeli lobby, not jewish lobby and perhaps he needs to write on a blackboard 100 times it is the israeli lobby. But is there an israeli lobby. There are people who very supportive of the state of israel. I am very supportive of the state of israel. So is senator hagel and you will see this in the confirmation hearings but it doesn't mean you have to agree with every single position that the israeli government takes. 
>> Fair enough, but on a couple of measures, it seems very important, he seemed to feel so strongly about his views about israel that he was a distinct minority in senate. For instance, one of only four senators in october 2000 who would not sign a letter expressing solidarity with israel because there was an intifada going on. Only one of a few senators renewing the libya sanctions act. He came back from a trip in 1998, he was critical of israel and the associated press report it this wake the headline, senator blames israel for the peace impasse. St do what it can to re-energize the peace process. Israeli prime minister netanyahu, quoting hagel, stop the process, the israeli government continues to play games. What I feel more today is desperate men do desperate things. You take hope away I hagel said you where the palestinians are today. There is a sense among his critics that he views this in an even handed way, that they share the blame, israelis and palestinians for a failure to achieve peace. Is that his view? 
>> He should be able to give his views what he will do at the confirmation hearing. I don't believe there's moral equivalency between the two sides which is the suggestion of that article. 
>> He believe there is moral equivalency? 

[00:07:32]


>> You will haveo ask him what he believes. My judgment and knowledge of chuck and my discussions with chuck would suggest that he wants to see both sides come to the table and find a solution. He supports the peace process. But he is upper mostry, very strong supporter of the state of israel. He has voted for billions and billions of dollars of aid to israel. I have no question when it comes to challenges that have anything to do with putting israel at risk, chuck hagel will be on israel's side. Remember, he is working for a president. And he will follow the poll so i 
-- policies of that president. 
>> The renewed debate about iraq is also occurring. The "new york times" writes about that today. In his memoir, he writes something very poignant about the iraq war. He writes, "it all comes down to the fact we were asked to vote on a resolution based on half-truths, untruths and wishful thinking. I voted for this resolution that gave the president the authority to go to war in iraq. If all diplomatic efforts were exhausted and failed, unfortunately, it was not his intention to exhaust all diplomatic efforts. He is talking about the diplomatic efforts you were engaged in as secretary of state in the run-up to the war of iraq. 
>> We disagree with his characterization. We were basing all of our actions on a national intelligence estimate that the congss asked for and was provided to the congress by the cia. And all of us in the bush administration at that time accepted the judgment of our 16 intelligence communities. I present it had to the u.N. Three months before I present it had to the u.N., Congress passed a resolution, also supported by senator hagel and many other senators that would give the president the authority to go to war. Weren't half-truths is what we were being told by the intelligence community. We subsequently found out that a lot of that information was not accurate and that is very unfortunate but that's the way it unfolded. 
>> Was he wrong on iraq? 
>> With respect to what? 
>> With respect to what he ultimately called a huge foreign policy blunder? 
>> He -- that's his characterization and if people want to challenge his characterization, they will have that opportunity. 
>> In your judgment, was he wrong on iraq? 
>> I would not have called it that, I would have said what i think that the president had more than sufficient basis to believe there were weapons of mass destruction that were a danger to the world and possibility of those weapons going to terrorists. And so, he undertook military action. I think that was the correct thing to do and it was well supported by the intelligence. I think we did not execute the operation well. Once baghdad fell there was a feeling that was the end of it. It was not. It was just the beginning for it. 

[00:10:07]


>> He was controversial for comments he made gays, add said about a ambassadorial nominee during the clinton administration, he was aggressively gay and detract from his effectiveness. He apologized for those comments. 
>> The apology accepted by the ambassador. 
>> But he -- the question that has been raised is can he, as defense secretary, forcefully implement the reversal of don't ask, don't tell, at a critical time, especially when they have not resolved same-sex partner benefits, for instance? 
>> Don't ask, don't tell isn't there anymore. It doesn't have to be reversed. It's gone. And I think that what senator hagel will do as he has said as he wl certainly testify at the confirmation hearing, that he will fully implement don't ask, don't tell there are still issues that have to be resolved but I think he will go after these issues in a way that will be very consistent with the administration's position with the law and with the aspirations of our gay and lesbian men and women in military. He is not responsible for them. He is not responsible for them having a proper environment in which to do their jobs and that will include making sure that don't ask, don't tell and elimination of don't ask, don't tell is fully implemented. 
>> With regard to the military dget, he has called the military a bloated organization. Chairman of the joint chiefs, martin dempsey, said this week that we are on the brink of creating a hollow force. Would a secretary of defense hagel preside over the hollowing out of the defense department? 
>> The biggest concern with respect to who will league out is this sequester that's hanging like a sword over the department. That's what they had tried -- have to not let that happen but with respect to going in and finding things within the department of defense that perhaps you don't need or you can eliminate, if that's what you mean by bloat, I hope he does find bloat and gets rid of it. 
>> Do you agree with his characterization that it's bloated? 
>> Bloated doesn't necessarily mean the whole department is bloated. Bloated mean there is are probably things in the department that you can take a hard look at and determine whether or not you need it in light of the current situation and the strategy we are implementing. When I was chairman, we saw the end of the soviet union, completely different change in our strategic positioning. And we eliminated 1 million troops and cut the budget 25%. That's not the case now. But there's no reason why a secretary of defense should go into office thinking can't change anything, can't cut anything. You know, the people who say that, oh, that's terrible, he is going to try to find things to cut in the department are the same people saying we have got to cut spending, we have got to cut spending. Everything has to be looked at, entitlements, more revenue, yes, you have to look at the defense department to see if there are opportunities for savings. 

[00:12:51]


>> Bottom line, does chuck hagel get confirmed? 
>> I think he gets confirmed. Ultimately superbly qualified based on his overall record, based on his service to the country, based on how he feels about troops and veterans and families. I think he will do a great job as secretary of defense. And I think in his confirmation hearings, all of these issues that you have raised, others have raised, he will be prepared to deal w I have read some of the responses that he has already put together and I think would he make a version very spirited defense secretary in his position and be broadly confirmed. 
>> More broadly talking about the national security team. Interesting the president chose this political fight over chuck hagel. Declined to have it over susan rice. What was your view of her treatment in this whole process? 
>> I think it was not handled well. One of the problems with ambassador rice and chuck hagel, these signals come out saying this is who we are thinking about and you are left out there to dangle for weeks. Well, if this is who you are going to nominate you nominate them and let's get on with the procs. 
>> You feel like the president hung her out to dry? 
>> In both the susan rice case and chuck hagel case, if they were sure that is who they were going to nominate, I think it should have been done promptly but all these sort of test nominations that they send out there, I think just cause the media to naturally focus on it and potential opponents of that nomination just pile on. 
>> Outgoing secretary of state hillary clinton, she is facing pressure to testify on the benghazi matter. Do you think that benghazi episode is a blot on her record as secretary of state? Do you think it will affect her political future? 
>> I don't think so. I don't know what she knew about it or didn't know about it or where she was and so we will have to wait and see how the testimony goes. But I think she has had a distinguished record and I don't think this one incident, one of these things that those of us in government have been through many, many times, where suddenly an action happens late at night, you're surprised. Somebody gets killed. Something gets blown up. And then the afteraction reports start and everybody wants to know who was at fault, who was responsible? Why didn't keep this from happening? You can't keep everything from happening. Benghazi was a very, very difficult one in a difficult situation and maybe they shouldn't have been there in the first place. And I think that we have had a good review of that by ambassador pickering and admiral mullin and I don't know whether the congress in their examination of mrs. Clinton will find something that they find distasteful. I don't think it is a blot on her record. 

[00:15:25]


>> Do you think hillary clinton would make a good president? 
>> I think she would be good in whatever does. If she is interested on that or not, I will let her opine on that. 
>> The broader issue of the foreign policy team, as I was just reflecting on, the mess 
-- the message that it appears to send. The financial times in summed it up this way, hagel selection seals end to bush's policies. This does not look like a let's invade iran teams says bruce reidel, a long-time cia officer, advised presidents on counterterrorism. Looks like a fine alternative to military action team, primarily a political solution. It seems like it is a rebuke to neoconservatives, those in the republican party feel there is unfinished business in the middle east and continue to project american power. Do you view it that way? 
>> The first obama administration was also not an administration saying let's go find some place to bomb. Neither, for that matter, was president bush's eight years. We fought the wars that we felt were necessary. President bush worked hard to try to solve other problems through diplomatic means. And so I think it's a little too stark to make this kind of characterization. I, as you well know, always believed that we should try to avoid war. We should be willing to talk to friends and willing to talk to enemies. And try to find a solution that's peaceful. But when do you find it is necessary to use military force, use it with a clear political objective in mind and use it for a decisive result. That's the kind of attitude that chuck hagel will bring to the equation. We will be careful. He will give the president his best advice on the use or non-use of military force, how to solve the problem diplomatically. I'm sure he will be a great companion with mr. Kerry in that regard. It's a good team. I think it's a very, very good team. Now, a lot of my friends in the community who are of a more rightist persuasion, ones who have been hawking -- the hawks. 
>> The hawks, you think they are out of line in their criticism? 
>> No. It's their fair criticisms. They can make all the criticisms they want. When they go over the edge and say because chuck said jewish lobby is anti-semitic, it is disgraceful. We shouldn't have that kind of language in our dialogue but they are fully entitled to their views and didn't ever think they would go away and not be heard from again. But they have to remember one thing, it's president obama, not president McCain and not president romney that lost two elections. The american people have made it clear that they are not particularly interested in finding new conflicts to get into. And not particularly interested in saying, you know, sanctions are just a road bump on the way to bombing. We should be very, very careful when we sort of toss around theories of use of military for situations that might be resolved in other ways. The other thing I would like to say about iran, we don't want them to have a nuclear weapon, we are punishing them severely now with the sanctions. We ought to keep it up. Multilateral sanctions, whatever unilateral things we want to do. And also remember, this is a country in deep trouble, does not have a nuclear weapon yes. We don't want it to have one. But remember what we have. I still am an old-fashioned realist that says deterrence still works and they should know what the consequences to them would be if they ever were to use or cause us to believe they were going to use such a weapon if they had it and they don't have it yet. 

[00:18:53]


>> To mix in foreign policy with some politics, I'm struck when you talk about republicans as they. I know you insist despite voting for president obama twice now that you're still a republican. But as I go through your record on some social issues and even foreign policy issues i challenge to you say on what basis are you still a republican? Do you feel like this republican party has left you or have you left it? 
>> I think the republican party right now is having an identity problem. And I'm still a republican. I'm a republican who grew up along with george bush xli. I grew up with ronald reagan, cap weinberger, frank carlucci that republican party, the republican party of dick lugar and john tower. But in recent years, there's been a significant shift to the right and we have seen what that shift has produced, two losing presidential campaigns. I think what the republican party needs to do now is take a very hard look at itself and understand that the country is changed. The country is changing demographically. If the republican party does not change along with that demographic, they are going to be in trouble. So, when we see this in one more generation, the minorities of america, african-americans, hispanic-americans, asian-americans will be the majority of the country, you can't go around saying we don't want to have a solid immigration policy. We are going to dismiss the 47%. We are going to make it hard for these minorities to vote, as in the last election what did that produce in the court struck that down and most importantly, it caused people to turn out and stand in line because these republicans were trying to keep us from voting. There's also a dark -- a dark vein of intolerance in some parts of the party what I do mean by that? I mean by that that they still sort of look down on minorities. How can I evidence that? When I see a former governor say that the president is shuckin' and jivin', that's racial era slave term. When I see another former governor after the president's first debate where he didn't do very well, says that the president was lazy. He didn't say he was slow. He was tired. He didn't do well. He said he was lazy. Now, it may not mean anything to most americans but to those of us who are african-americans, the second word is shiftless and then there's a third word that goes along with it. Birther, the whole birther movement, why do senior republican leaders tolerate this kind of discussion within the party? I think the party has to take a look at itself. It has to take a look at its responsibility for health care it has to take a look at immigration, it has to take a look at those less fortunate than us. The party has gathered unto itself a reputation that it is the party of the rich. It is the party of lower taxes. But there are a lot of people who are lower down the food chain, the economic chain, also paying lots of taxes relative to their income. And they need help. We need more education work being done in this country. We need a solid immigration policy. We have to look at climate chge there are a lot of things that the american people are expecting and the republican party, as they get ready for the next election, really has to focus on some of these issues and not ignore them. Everybody wants to talk about who is going to be the candidate you better think first about what's the party actually going to represent? If it's just gonna represent the far right-wing of the political spectrum, I think the party is in difficulty. I'm a moderate but I'm still a republican, that's how I was raised. Until I voted for mr. Obama twice I voted for seven straight republican presidents. 

[00:22:16]


>> A couple of other foreign policy matters, what should the force, u.S. Force in afghanistan look like after next year? 
>> I think the president's on track here. We've done by 2014 the end of 2014, as much as we can with our troops fighting on the ground. So, we've raised up a large afghan army and afghan national police force. Let's continue to give them assistance. Let's continue to advise them. Let's keep our counterterrorism people in place because it's al qaeda that we are really after. Remember, we didn't -- taliban wasn't even on our list of enemies in the first few days after 9/11. Only when they refused to give up al qaeda. So it's going to be up to the afghan people and the afghan forces in order to deal with any insurgent taliban coming in. We can help them with intelligence. We can help them with weapons training, whatever they need but the burden of defending their country and keeping it from falling again to the taliban will rest squarely on the shoulders -- 
>> what about zero option? You leave any troops there? 
>> I have heard this rumor about zero option. I don't know there's any merit to it. You have to stay there. We have to have advisers. We have to watch where the money's going. We have to be able to conduct counterterrorism activities, so I would support a zero option but there's always a tendency in washington on these issues to say 2,000, 4,000, 10,000 that's not the right way to go about it. A military plan you determine what it is that we have to do. How many advisers do we need? What kind of military assistance group do we need? And then you determine what those numbers are. I don't know what those numbers are. The president has laid out some areas were we want to continue helping afghanistan after 2014 and now the military will have to put numbers to those missions. 
>> You know there's a renew deed bait with the film "zero dark thirty" about interrogation technique of terror prisoners. This film is based, of course, on the successful hunt to bin laden. And the debate harkins took me to a visit former vice president cheney made on this program and told tim russert at the time things that would become necessary. Let me show you that. 

[00:24:23]


>> Also have to work the sort of dark side, spend time in the shadows and the intelligence world. That's the world these folks operate in. And so the's going to be vital for us to use any means at our disposal, disposal, basically to achieve our objective. It is a mean, nasty, dangerous, dirty business out there and we have to operate in that arena. 
>> To extent that enhanced interrogation techniques played some role in tracking down the majorly the courier that led to bin laden, I choose my words carefully, do the ends justify the means? 
>> We have determined that enhanced interrogation technique, such as waterboarding, torture, not going to do it anymore. The military didn't do it in the first place. And since 2003, it hasn't been done at all. I really can't answer the question as to whether or not movie's correct or what others have said are correct. But we can't be a nation that is lawless, can't be a nation that simply ignores our obligations to ourselves, our obligations to our constitution, our obligations to our own moral standing in the world. And so be tough, if on occasion you have to do something, be prepared to answer for what you're doing. But as the president has said and before him, po president bush was also -- we do not torture people. 
>> The ends justify the means, got bin laden in the end? 
>> We do not torture people it is against american policy. 
>> I want to end with this -- 
>> you can always debate what torture is. I know what torture is. 
>> A final political matter that is very important at this particular point as the president thinks about. After the connecticut massacre, what's the solution? What kind of restriction should be put in place? 
>> It's a very complex issue and I'm anxious to see what vice president biden is going to come up with. You have deranged people throughout the country, unfortunately and they areart of the problem are. You have to be deranged to pick up a bushmaster or some weapon and go into a school and kill people. How do we deal with that part of the problem? Is there an issue with violence, on television, violence in our games? That has to be looked at w respect to guns themselves, I'm a gun owner, believer in the second amendment, I note amendment rather thoroughly, i note issue of a well-regulated militia. But at the same time, we also have a responsibility under the constitution and the bill of rights to protect our people. So, surely, should be able to find some meeting of the minds on this issue. Why can't we test everybody or have everybody run through a screen to make sure that they are responsible person before they are allowed to buy a weapon, either in a store or in a private trance action? Why can't we do a better job of registering things? With respect to assault weapons, I see no need for bushmasters in the hands of an individual person who might be deranged. Want to fire a bushmaster, go out to a range and fire a bushmaster. But whether or not it's in our overall interest to have these kinds of weapons in the hands of americans who might not be responsible is a question we have to answer. How much are we really giving up if we said this kind of weapon should not be readily available to anybody who wants to buy one? And so I think we are at a very important point in our national dialogue on this. The nra feels very, very strongly. Gun owners feel very, very strongly. The same time, the american people are concerned about the kinds of things that are happening in our society. Surely, we can't get the whole ball of wax, I hope that there will be a way to find something in this continuum of things we can do that we are able to do to demonstrate to the american people that this problem is being taken seriously.

>>> coming up, most american workers got their first paycheck of the new year on friday and they probably noticed it was a little bit smaller. What happened? Well, in order to boost the economy back in 2010, congress lowered the social security tax withholding rate to 4.2% instead of the usual 6.2% for 2011 and 2012. It was called a payroll tax holiday and meant more money in the average paycheck but as of JANUARY 1st, THE HOLIDAY'S Officially over 'cause congress did not extend it during the end of the year fiscal cliff debate.

>>> The time has come for me to return to my wife silvia, our three sons, six children and my walnut farm. Dealing with a different set of nuts. 
>> Got the feeling that panetta was waiting so long to use that term about how many nut there is are in washington. I can't possibly know what he is talking about. Back with our roundtable, joining me, former governor of mississippi and former rnc chairman, haley barbour, mayor of newark, new jersey i cory booker, mike murphy and chief foreign affairs correspondent, andrea mitchell. Welcome to all of you. Well, governor barbour, I want to start with you, because i thought that was striking, some of general powell's comments, particularly about the republican party. He has now twice support president obama. He talks about a deep vein of intolerance within the party. How did that sit with you? 
>> Well, general powell and i have been friends since he quit being a general and could be involved in politics. We don't see everything the same way but one thing very plain, republicans in this election did more poorly among hispanics, much more poorly among asian-americans and typically poorly among african-americans. We have to improve our standing among all of tse the good thing is with the right kind of policies and the right kind of effort, we will do that. Remember george bush, the last republican, got 44% of the public vote. Not like there's some 1,000-year history here. 
>> You once said that colin powell is in the mainstream of the republican party. Do you believe that today? 
>> I believe he is on the vast majority of the issues, i believe he see it is through his own prism. 
>> Mayor booker what do you think about that comment, particularly intolerance directed toward this president? 
>> First of all, I think he is spot on and I see the republican party moving away from the olympia snowes, lugers and jack kemp even, people with great ideas and putting a lot know the conversation. The rhetoric in this last campaign, I saw it in my community you turned off a lot of people, black, latino, women and guy. It was unnecessary. I turned on the tv, I sat up in my bed when I saw newt gingrich talking about marriage equality and how the republican party was going to have to start embracing some of these realities of the where the country is going or be left behind. And I think that's very, very true. And what I really would love to see though from both parties is stop speaking about how we can win ections and more importantly, how we can address the issues of america because the reality is if we focus on solving problems, that is good politics. Good policy. Good problem solving. Pragmatism always in my opinion, makes for good politics. 

[00:38:05]


>> Mike murphy, you have had a lot of these similar critics but your thoughts about colin powell this morning? 
>> I agreed from the way we ignored demographics but happy to hear he is still a republican, kind of off on a democratic bender for a few years, that was good news to me and I invite him to come back home and help us modernize and strengthen the party. We could use him. 
>> Bottom line, andreaitchell, you can come in on this, but one of the big questions on the table, the politics of the hagel nomination, does he ultimately get confirmed? 
>> Most likely yes. Presidents get their choices. We have seen cases such as john tower, where that didn't happen. There is a point where at times, if something is said at a confirmation hearing or something else comes out we wouldn't expect in this case, where the opposition can reach critical mass and was here on "meet the press" that chuck schumer indicated his ambivalence to say the least. He is a key player here. And if chuck schumer and other democrats decide that they are g to go against this, then they have got a real problem. Chuck hagel has been talking to almost I think 30 senators privately. He is working it very hard. You saw what colin powell said today he has other advocates, brent scowcroft, don ridge, others who have known him for many years and support him by, too is in a different part of the republican party. It's not just that he has difficult personal relationship but he really offended john McCAIN IN 2008. He didn't endorse barack obama but he traveled with him and that was a tacit endorsement going to iraq and afghanistan with obama and it really angered McCAIN. 
>> Governor barbour, one of the questions that andrea raised in discussions with us this week is how does somebody who has got such a tough relationship with republicans help this president lead big budget cut backs at the pentagon? Won't that be tough on capitol hill? . 
>> It remains to be seen. He wasn't picked to improve the president's relationship with republicans. Like general powell, not sure exactly why he was picked but as andrea said, normally, the presidents get their choices for the cabinet. These hearings, I think, will be contentious, particularly on iran, israel, hamas and hezbollah. We will see. I should tell you, chuck hagel and I have been friends since THE MID'70s WHEN WE WERE YOUNG Staffers. His wife was from meridian, mississippi. That maybe enough to help him. 

[00:40:15]


[ Laughter ] but the fact of the matter is this is going to be about substance and about some things that are part of america's future and senator schumer i think put his finger on that. 
>> This is really though, mike, about the fights the president wants to pick and the ones he is gonna win. 
>> Mm-hmm. 
>> We are seeing this already in this nomination process. 
>> I'm puzzled by all of this. I think the president has forgotten the campaign's over because we went through the fiscal cliff negotiation and it was a steel wall on any spending cuts which every expert said is a huge part of the problem and a huge part of the solution. The president shut that down. Now he has a pick and others, the job of defense secretary is going to be about managing budget problems because the president doesn't seem to have any interest in entitlements it is a contentious pick. We are going to have a five. I thk the president is favored to win and more votes in senate but fighting over secretary of 5- defense, that is not a way forward. That is the same thing of jack lew, totally qualified by the president seems to be digging in to fighting rather than getting solutions. That surprises me. 
>> Part of this nomination process has been done almost nothing but attract criticism. There is an issue of diversity in cabinet as well and the tale of the images that have been presented. The "new york times" image that was about a story about the lack of diversity among the president's senior team, put that picture up that showed during the debt fight all white men surrounding him, valerie jarrett apparently not visible there because dan fiver is standing in front of her. The white house released a counterpicture that pointed out that you had kathy remler, is there a problem with the president not pursuing more diversity, more women in his cabinet? Are you troubled by that? 

[00:42:16]


>> To me this almost seems swift voting, you look at the data and numbers, taking a person's strength and trying to create a weakness out of it. The ht has about -- the president has about 50% of white house staff are women. Which is twice a percentage that bush had and significantly more than clinton h appointments to the court, three women on the supreme court, two appointed by the president. 
>> Big cabinet jobs, white men. 
>> The cabinet is not fully fleshed out now. 
>> Big jobs. 
>> Please don't diminish cabinet-level position as certain ones big, certain ones not. For domestic policy guy with the city every day, things -- many cabinet positions are very important. But let's just focus in on two things. One that is very disingenuous to show that picture when 50% of the staff in the white house is women. Number two to me, very important to understand this is a president who has expanded health care opportunities for women a president who stood up on his first legislation, lilly ledbetter law. You look at his policies and his practices, he is changing the focus of this country. 
>> I think a lot of women, andrea, would disagree this is the idea of swift voting this administration. 
>> Let me say, that was a white house photo, that picture taken by the president's photographer, that indicated who was around him when he was dealing with the fiscal cliff negotiations, that's what that picture represented. At the highest levels of the white house and in the cabinet, you have men and they are white men. Now, the numbers -- we can plate numbers game but as another democratic president said during a transition in 1992, you bean counters, you women's groups who are counting heads, I'm gonna fill these jobs but they were at lower level he is. The fact is that men help elect the president. Women voted for the president in the greatest numbers but the men on his team were the predominant people. You have two women who are the white house deputy chiefs of staff leaving this week but two women and neither of them are being mentioned at any of these trial balloons to replace jack lew, I have to tell you I wrote a story about this week and i did not get one complaint. I get lots of complaints from the white house about things that I say and do sometimes it's correct. Sometimes I have to correct something. But not one person, and I talked to several people inside the white house, women, and they said, no, we didn't have any problem with what you wrote about this week. Women are not happy. 

[00:44:32]


>> I got a horse laugh out of it you see that picture, old, rich white guys, looks like romney voters. Going to have to rename the cabinet table, millionaire's row. A bigger indication here, the cabinet is getting smaller. He is not looking for opposing voices, no super stature people, like leon panetta, bob gates or hillary clinton. This is the yes, sir cabinet. We have big problems and shrinking to white house-centric. 
>> Described as a band of brothers cabinet this go-around, into the team of rivals. 
>> To me, it's even more -- it's beginning to look like a staff. Beginning to look like the president's staff. 
>> He will argue that he was elected. Why shouldn't he have the people around him. 
>> He has every right. A lot of presidents in their second term have become more and more isolated, listening only to the people that agree with them. That's republican president as well. 
>> Nobody was saying this in his first term, we know what that looked like, hillary clinton to valerie jarrett. Second term is not clear, all the seats not filled around the table. In addition this not a staff. Chuck hagel was a republican, is a republican, has diversity. Give him time to finish, fill out the staff and more importantly, I want to keep coming back to, is this election was fought over the issues that are important to america and women clearly saw that this is a president that will fight for, affirm and advance equality or justice. 
>> I want to get back to some of the issues, the fights he is picking, the fight he could win or lose in the second term. I want to talk about that with the group when we come back, right after this.My heart burns for you... ?????? I'm up next, but now I'm singing the heartburn blues.

Some people had changes in behavior, thinking or mood, hostility, agitation, depressed mood and suicidal thoughts or actions while taking or after stopping chantix. If you notice any of these stop taking chantix and call your doctor right away. Tell your doctor about any history of depression or other mental health problems, which could get worse while taking chantix. Don't take chantix if you've had a serious allergic or skin reaction to it. If you develop these stop taking chantix and see your doctor right away as some can be life-threatening. If you have a history of heart or blood vessel problems, tell your doctor if you have new or worse symptoms. Get medical help right away if you have symptoms of heart attack. Use caution when driving or operating machinery. Common side effects include nausea, trouble sleeping and unusual dreams. It helps to have people around you... They say, you're much bigger than this.

The but the problem almost everything done is already against the launch the governor of connecticut said they had the fourth strictest gun law in the united states. 
>> Didn't have a magazine ban, a high-capacity magazine ban. 
>> What we are talking about here is something really a awful, glad there is start to be attention on the mental health side, a tough, tough, tough issue. But look, if you make it a crime to have a gun, only criminals will have guns that's just a fact. 
>> We bump up against the issues of the second amendment or first amendment when you get to video games, mike that is somehow going to have to be resolved. The optics were there in terms of a big, inclusive approach. Does the president want this fight? 
>> It is difficult. Democrats historically backed away in the past ten years from gun control politics. I will say, this as usual, the easily political bumper sticker stuff that might make people feel good is the least effective stuff. What works is the hard thing. We have 300 million guns on the street. In you profile the crazy, young adolescent males, we need to change the health laws. There are privacy issues. We got to fight that five. It is easier to control a small number of crazy people than 300 million guns already out there 

[00:50:59]


>> but this debate is so tiring to me because we always are talking about the wrong issue. So, there are over 30 people murdered every day, almost a virginia tech every day in this country. Which would lead this debate is pragmatic, consensus and data. The reality is, in my streets, majority assault weapons, hey, i would support an assault weapon ban but only affect a small percentage of the murders in this country. Right now, we have 74% of nra members that agreeh pragmatic changes to gun safety laws that would stop murderers in my city, murderers in chicago, murderers in los angeles, which are the murders that are happening all over our country right now. Let me just give you a specific example. Let me give you the specific solution. Right now. If you were on the terrorist no-fly list and can't get on a plane and fly to newark, you can go gun shows, buy trunk loads full of weapons. We have traced the guns killing people on my streets and coming from the secondary market. Everybody, gun owners, over 80% of gun owners america say you should not be a able to just go anywhere and buy a gun without a background check. You fix that data shows if you're a woman murdered in this country, 50% of those women are murdered by someone they know. In places that have shutdown these secondary markets, they have been able to drop that 40%. If you want to keep people safe, let's not waste political capital on the margins -- 
>> you were right about the gun show loophole, everybody ought to get a background check. I'm for that. 
>> Just do that would make people safer. 300 million guns in circulation, if you don't address mental health, down the -- 
>> this is where you're wrong, one thing you're wrong, one thing you're right. Legal, law-abiding citizen does not kill people. I look at all the shootings in my city and could only find one that is done where somebody had a gun legally. I'm not worried about you buying a gun, you buying a gun. Where people need to stop about all the guns in circulation they don't concern me. The guns that concern me, the ability for a criminal with mal intent. 

[00:53:04]


>> You can't say the crime in your city not guns only in circulation that might have been bought legally and solved. 
>> If you shutdown the -- 
>> there's no time machine. 
>> Ways to shutdown the secondary market. Say lose your gun, you should to report that mental health issue, to have 19 states in america have less than 100 people reported as mental health bars from bringing guns into the federal database that is a problem. That is a problem. 
>> I have been told the president is going to do the big things. He is going to do the assault weapon ban. He is going to do the background checks, he has spoken of this. Not going to back off on it. Whereas some of us thought frankly watching joe biden and talking to people around a this task force that he was not going to go there, when this gets reported to the president, very quickly, by the end of this month, he is going to take some very big steps. It is a fight he wants to take on clearly. They may not get it. The politics aren't there yes. But he is going to at least engage congress on. 
>> I have a couple of minutes and a couple things want to get to quickly. First of all, for you, mayor booker, you are taking on some of these big debates and might take them on in the senate. You filed your papers to run for the senate in new jersey to take on a senator lautenberg. Is that what you intend to do? Will you run? 
>> Again, you have to file the papers even to do research on the issue, even to travel on the issue. So, we are complng with the law before we do any exploration of the senate run. We have got to file an account. That is my intention. It is over a year away. A lot is going to change between now and then. 
>> Senator lautenberg called you self-absorbed and disrespectful. One of his spokespersons did. Excuse me. The idea you have not worked out with senator lautenberg what his plans are. Any missteps in terms of that? 
>> No again this is really early. We have reached out to him. Even had a trip down here to speak with him but he wasn't able to speak. Right now the senator, who i support, needs to focus on the debt ceiling, focus on funding for sandy. I have two very good senators in the senate, we are going t support that. This campaign is over a year away. You know new jersey has to focus on a governor's race and legislative race. For know do it good exploration, due diligence for running I have to file. 

[00:55:13]


>> Not ruling out challenging? 
>> Not ruling out anything but premature to be speculative. 
>> I don't want us to leave without taking on a topic that has been big this week, if you saw the new york times with the hall of fame voting reflecting the steroids era, there it was. The inductees, a blank page, the likes of barry bonds, sosa and others were not inducted. Now you have got haley barbour, lance armstrong, preparing to do an interview, famously win over THE tour de France but has lost those titles because of doping accusations. It appears that he may make some confessions here, like to be reinstated, according to some of the reports be to be able to compete in the olympics or triathlons and the like. How does this work? Public mea culpas and reinstating his good name? 
>> Well, it doesn't do anything about excessive federal spending. We know it. 
>> Do you have a view on it? 
>> Well, look, the doping deal is very good for america. For the people that are making the decisions say you got to play by the rules if you want to get the benefits. Now, that's just the way it ought to be in our country. Some of those people I thought were -- some of those ball players, baseball players i genuinely admired, crazy about, but people ought to be held the standard of the rules. 
>> Yeah. 
>> I'm tired of the contrition culture, he is guilty and disgraced his sport. I don't think armstrong ought to get any quarter at all. Ought to be banned for life. 
>> Anybody disagree? 
>> I want to say the real story here is the kids who look up to these people and I see what's going on in high school football culture, see what's going on at the college level. It anguishes me deeply what children now are thinking, that this win at any costs culture is what we are creating as opposed to sportsmanship, honor and integrity in our sports. 
>> Hear hear for the hall of fame. Baseball should not be diminished by the inclusion of these players. They have disgraced themselves. They have not disgraced the game, which is the greatest game. 
>> You know what would only enhance baseball and not diminish it finally the veterans committee would vote steve garvey into the hall of fame for his prowess, his durability and he is my favorite baseball player of all time.

>>> This morning my question as tina fey and amy poehler take the stage tonight, are we in a golden era for women in comedy? Plus, when it comes to education is no boys allowed the next best thing for girls? And the mother who los her son to gun violence twice. First, want to know what joe biden plans to do about the guns? Me, too. I'm going to ask his son. Good morning. I'm melissa harris-perry. Biden's report to the president comes a week after meetings in search of some common ground among all the sides of the gun control debate. The usual suspects, firearm retailers including a reluctant walmart, gun violence survivors who shared their firsthand experiences, gun control proponents and gun control opponents pushing for expanded rights. The de facto leader of that opposition, the national rifle association issued a statement after their sit-down with the vice president. Their solution? To dig in deeper on the all guns all the time ideology and put armed guards in every american school. The nra promises to marshall their formidable, political and financial resources to fight any new reforms every step of the way. They will do so with the support of allies in congress, most notably republicans on the house committee who continue to propose limits on assault weapons. No surprises there. By now, we are familiar with the political players and per am ters with the debate that feels as old as the second amendment itself or at least we think we are. Because history tells us a different story. It tells us that all of our uniquely american relationships to guns, who is allowed to have them, who feels threatened by them and how our laws seek to find a balance between the two extremes have never been fixed. In fact, that history reflects a series of ever evoling, conflicting contradictory points that have been characterized not by policy, but panic. Panic over perceptions of who is with us and who is against us. This time, it is a panic inspired by the fear a madman will walk into a public space and kill indiscriminately. I want to go back a bit. Nearly five decades. There was a prominent organization that defended a strict interpretation of the second amendment and the right of individual americans to use guns to protect themselves when the state could or would not. The name of that organization was the black panther party. They may have been the farthest thing from what the founders imagined when they wrote well regulated militia in the second amendment. A militia depending themselves against the tyranny of the state by taking up arms was their mission. It was started by two men in 1966. The panthers took up arms in response to random and indiscriminate violence perpetrated against black people in california by the oakland police in an america catching up to the promise of the civil rights legislation. Members of the organization received training from experienced instructors and how to maintain and shoot guns. They carried them openly in public in compliance with the police and the laws at the time. Go as far as to police the police to patrol them as the police patrolled oakland residents. The response was broad and decisive. A republican state assemblyman proposed a state law that would make it illegal to carry a loaded weapon in any city in california. The law created to disarm the black panthers would affect all gun owners in the state of california. In a dramatic showdown, they responded with their version of nra lobbying on capitol hill. They showed up with shotguns on the state capital building in sacramento. They were prevented from entering the chamber, their message was received loud and clear. It was signed into law by someone who seems an improbable advocate for gun control. This guy. No, your eyes are not fooling you. That is republican party demagogue ronald reagan, a supporter of what was at the time one of the strictist gun laws in the nation. The panic over black people with guns mag fied in cities like detroit in the shooting deaths of bobby kennedy revoked a policy response from the government. President lyndon b. Johnson signed the gun control act of 1968. 

[00:05:45]


>> We have come here to sign the most comprehensive gun control law ever signed in this nation's history. 
>> As we await tuesday for vice president biden's recommendaons, the president's respond and the outcry from either or both sides, we are well served to keep in mind in recent history, there's no clear liberal or consensus on gun policy. Our freedoms, cherished as they are must be balanced by civic responsibilities. At the table today, dan gross, tracy meres, law professor at yale university. Thanks to all of you for being here. 
>> Thank you. 
>> I want to start with you in part because I tell this story, a story that I think has been lost even though it's recent history. I worry as we enter into the new conversation about guns and the possibility of getting common sense gun legislation that we will miss this has not always been a partisan issue and hasn't been id logicallymarketed. What do we learn from this history? 
>> History is long standing. It goes back far beyond the black panthers. During the fugitive slave law resistance, frederick douglas resisted slave catchers. We see it moving up through the 1960s. Your point about the black panthers is interesting. It's a stage where in my scholarship I have described at the dichotomy. The leadership and grass roots made a distinction. They thought it was a crucial resource for black folks. Up to the point of the radical resistance of the black panthers, that dichotomy was vividly upheld. The panthers sullied that process. The book I'm working on talks about that phenomena in more detail. WHAT WE FIND UP UNTIL THE 1970s Is a clear endorsement by martin luther king and everyone in the movement. 

[00:08:18]


>> As you put on, this is a path that goes way back, right? We might be able to say, look, we would be a better and safer country if there's no second amendment. We might be able to say it's not part of our tradition, but it's not where we are. We are in a place where wherever gun control legislation we are going to implement and institute is in this context. Talk about civically responsible gun ctrol legislation at the time we talk about the second amendment. 
>> Here is the crazy thing. This is not a partisan political debate in the discourse of america. 92% of americans support things like background checks to keep guns out of the hands of criminals, felons, abusers, dangerously mentally ill. That has nothing to do with the second amendment right. 74% of nra members support criminal background checks. The only place where this is a heated partisan debate is in the halls of congress and sometimes, in the media when they pit two extreme sides against each other. It's not the conversation the american public wants to have. They don't want a conversation about putting more guns in schools. The gun lobby puts out out there with the hope of dragging it into the uncivil conversation contrary to any solution that would keep guns off our streets and out of the hands of dangerous people. 
>> The teachers with guns, right, this image of teachers actually standing there being trained with guns scares me -- like this is exactly the wrong direction for this conversation. 
>> It scares teachers to death, too. >> Right. It feels like it is based on who the good guys and bad guys are. We are responding to newtown, basically. We have to arm teachers because in this case, teachers would have done something different. We can't assume teachers are always the good guys. We don't want to give them pensns but we want to arm them. 

[00:10:27]


>> Nobody else is responding that way. A few people on the extreme of this, that is not the conversation the american public wants to have. It's not the conversation they want us to have on this show. Themt to talk about the things we can do to prevent gun violence and the respect for the second amendment. They can co-exist. 
>> We should be proactive. If we look at two things, short term fixes, which is the gun, we have long term solutions the potential shooting and victim. We have to do both. Not just gun legislation on tuesday to look at the recommendation. How do we do assault weapons bans andlose loopholes? How do we look at young people who might be potentially dangerous. We have to look at how do we stop that. From the beginning, not just how do we get rid of guns. 
>> This is the challenge. It's in response to the kinds of gun violence that is actually not -- in other words, it is the teenagers being shot in the streets of chicago. 
>> Two points on that. One, I like your point, michael, about making it broder. One way is recognize the issue for what it is, public health. When we think of it as public health, we pay attention to the fact there have been 4 million firearm injuries in the last 40 years. They include not only the good guys and bad guys, but suicide, accidents and the like. The fact that because of some of the nra activism we haven't been able to do the research to figure out the parameters and scope and details of the problem. I think that's one. It's kind of like, the abortion debate, to bring something else high profile in. There's a problem between characterizing it on pro-choice on one hand and pro-life on the other rather than a concept of reproductive justice. 

[00:12:31]


>> In the broader sense. We have a lot more to say. We are going to spend the whole hour on this issue. It is complicated. Stay there. The vice president is set to deliver his suggestions on gun policy on tuesday. Up next, I'm going to ask his son, delaware attorney general, bo biden for a preview.?????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????? ?????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????? 

[00:16:12]


>>> when vice president joe biden presents the president with his recommendations all options will be on the table. Not all options will make it to the final legislation. Banning assault weapons, limiting high capacity magazines face strong opposition from opponents. The president is fond of saying letting the perfect be the enemy of the good. 
>> I want to make it clear that we are not going to get caught up in the notion unless we can do everything, we are going to do nothing. It's critically important we act. 
>> My next guest can give us a closer look at what the action may look like. He's involve of the state level of new policies and the son of the vice president who is directly involved to the man crafting them. Joining me from delaware is state attorney beau biden. Nice to have you mr. Biden. 
>> Happy to be on, melissa. 
>> First in your role as attorney general, you and the governor will be presenting state level plans at the beginning of next week even as the vice president is going to help us see what the federal level plans are beginning on tuesday. What does the gun problem look like from your vantage point? 
>> Well, the gun problem here in the city of wilmington is pronounced. We have many things you talked about in the previous segment, young people are arming themselves with a cell phone, a weapon and committing violence at record levels in the city of wilmington. We are focused on it very much in the state of delaware. Obviously, we are concerned about school safety. Tomorrow the governor and I will be putting forth a whole package of laws that will hopefully protect kids in schools and on the streets in wilmington. One of the pieces I can preview what I'm going to do, not what the vice president is going to do. The governor and I are going to resubmit a law he put forward 18 months ago that would require universal background checks. I loved your lead in with the history of the 1968 gun control act and the work the brady's who are now citizens of the background check. Instant criminal background check noun as the nix was fought tooth and nail by the nra. It's over the course of the last 15 years stopped 2 million people prohibited on the gun control act from getting weapons. Half of whom are convicted felons who have gone to purchase weapons. What we have heard, the leader from brady knows this. No one is dumb enough to go to purchase legally a weapon. The facts have born something else out. The brady law helps stop it and make this is safer place to live. 

[00:19:29]


>> The background check allows us to trace how many more gun sales occur month-to-month. One of the more shocking statistics we have seen since the holiday tragedy at newtown is as "the new york times" reports, this enormous increase in the number of people seeking guns. "The new york times" reported december was a record for criminal background checks before many gun purchases, a strong indication of a big increase in sales. We are looking at 2.2 million background checks performed in the month of december. It was an increase over that period in 2011. What does that tell you, attorney general, about how people are reacting both to newtown and the attempts to make some common sense legislation around guns? 
>> It makes it difficult. What we have seen in my office as a chief law enforcement officer, I'm in charge of doing background checks for people applying for concealed weapons permit. We have seen a huge up tick in that. Well in front of what happened in connecticut. I see a lot of misinformation out there. Gun sales went through the roof well before the tragedy in connecticut upon the election of president barack obama in november of last year. So, there's a lot of misinformation. The same thing happened when the president and vice president were elected in 2008 and 2009. Gun sales went through the roof. There's a lot of misinformation outs there about what the administration wanlts to do, what others want to do and we need everybody to take a deep breath here and come up with a reasonable, sensible approach about how to honor the second amendment and keep our schools and the streets of our cities safe. 
>> Let me ask you one question. Very specifically about your father who is now leading this charge. What insights do you have about him either as a man or legislature to help us understand how he is approaching the task of bringing forward a gun proposal? 

[00:21:30]


>> Well, I can tell you, he's going to do what he and the president have done on every piece of legislation they have approached the last four years. One, bring all the stake holders together and hear them out from the nra to sportsmen to victims to survivors. My father was on the phone last night with folks, survivors in connecticut and the parents of the children who were, you know, killed in that awful tragedy. So he's going to listen to everyone. Then come up with a common sense approach about how to make sure that something like what happened in connecticut doesn't happen again and bring a sense of safety to city streets around the communities. That's what he'll do. He has a, you know, he gets a lot of credit for having relationships with congress over the last four years. Really, what his talent is is having an encyclopedia knowledge and what the stake holders position is and finding common ground. It's what he did at the turn of the year with the negotiations on the fiscal cliff. I think it's what the president asked him to do as it relates to bringing some legislation in front of cons to make us a safer country from gun violence. It's what he's in the midst of doing as we speak. 
>> Thank you beau biden. I appreciate your insights on this. 
>> Thank you.

>>> washington does the slow work of crafting gun policy around gun violence, people on the ground in america's cities are confronted with the real world consequences every day. Activists in cities that arndt hard hit are taking aix on their own. Joining me is the director of cease-fire illinois an organization that stops the violence before it starts. Nice to see you. 
>> Yeah, glad to be here with you, melissa. 
>> I watch a bit of the documentary on your organization. It is pretty intense work. Tell the viewers a bit about what your organization does. 
>> Well, cease-fire is a public health model that is aimed towards changing behaviors associated with violence. We hire violence interrupters and people who work in the field of behavioral change. It's a learned behavior and handed down from generation to generation. We teach that they can unlearn it. 
>> Let's be clear. When you say trying to teach young people, this is not like your friendly saturday afternoons with 4-year-olds to talk about guns are bad. You are standing on -- standing between people who are sometimes at this moment potentially about to be in a gunfight. 

[00:27:38]


>> The young men and women throughout america, we have stood in the middle of 45 conflicts in chicago. In one, a guy shot a grandmother's window, then burned her car. He said he wasn't going to listen to anybody. As an end result, the grandmother's grandsons are still alive today. That's something we caught on the front end. 
>> I want to bring tracy into this. I know you know one another from some of the work for many years in chicago. 
>> One thing that is important about what cease-fire does is addresses the violence of young men, african-american men in particular. We know gun violence is the number one source, reason for death among that age group. We also know looking at chicago in particular that the way people are connected in the communities is important. If you look at the high crime community where tio and his colleagues are working, homicide rate is high. East and west garfield park is known for a high homicide rate. Take everybody who has been killed in the last five years. Look at who they have been arrested with and look at who they are arrested with. My colleague andrew and I call it two degrees of kevin bacon. You look at that network of people and the homicide rate among that group is an astonishing 300 per 100,000. Take that group out of the community and the homicide rate of everybody else is less than three per 100,000. 
>> To be part of that network makes a difference to a gun violence problem than the moment of whether you have access to the weapon. 
>> These programs are so crucial to this conversation. Cease-fire chicago, I love my life in southeast jamaica queens. These folks, they are heroes. They are going in the middle of a battle and trying to stop violence every single day. If any politician or any funder is watching this program on tuesday afternoon when the vice president makes h recommendation, make sure we fund these programs. Put adequate funding into these programs or else forget chicago, forget queens and camden. We need to fund these programs. These guys are making nothing, begging for money. They work. We see them work. 

[00:30:18]


>> We have them begging for money but the nra has loads of money, right? We know that enormous consequences of that money and the lobbying of that money in terms of how it impacts the work these folks are trying to do on the ground. 
>> Clearly, there's not enough money to go around. That money needs to go toward programs like cease-fire. You talked aboute my life. There's another program called speak up. That encourages young people to come forward and report threats of weapons that can prevent a lot of violence. The heartening thing is that these conversations are part of the comprehensive look of this issue that the president and vice president through this task force are consciously taking. It's important to keep the conversations together and not unlink them. Both are critical elements. There are things we can do to keep guns off the streets. Brownsville, jamaica of chicago. There are also things we can do with the vice president and president. It's not just a conversation around newtown to being one about deaths that occur much more frequently in the kind of neighbors we are talking about. 
>> I'm going to let you in in a moment. I want to holas here. 
>> We talk the nra on one side and everyone else on the other. You mentioned the grandmother in chicago, it also brought to mind otis McDonald who was the lead PLAINTIFF in McDonald versus chicago. There are also in communities like this, what I call the community of innocence. People who are elderly, the grandmother you mentioned here. The interest in self-defense they have is a significant one. Ink it actually does a disservice to the debate to suggest it's only the nra with this interest in self-defense within the window where the state really cannot respond. It's a private crisis. 

[00:32:28]


>> This is incredibly important to you. It feels like part of what goes on is a sense of if communities are disarmed, which in one way makes perfect sense, take the beef and turn it into fistfights instead of gunfights a everybody lives with it. Given there are so many weapons, there are a lot of good guys. The grandmas who say look, i want my guns. They are part of protection against the bad guys and importantly in a city like chicago, a history where the police themselves, the state doesn't necessarily make you feel safe. There's been inadequate policing in those communities or the wrong kind of policn those communities. 
>> Well, you know, my thing is you have to keep working on changing behavior. You cannot change the circumstances all the time throughout the united states. I had a chance to sit down with prime minister david camden. You have 16,000 knife crowns in one year. It's about the thick. A lot of people have been raised in this violent culture. They think it's okay. Homicides should be treated as the greatest epidemic. The greatest challenge for the 21st century as an epidemic. Violence spreads like an epidemic disease. If I'm mad at your friends, I'm mad at you. In rwanda, 900,000 people killed because of this put in people's minds. Look what happened in nazi germany. Violence has been around for a long time. We need to treat it as a public health issue. We change the minds across america and across the world so we can all become healthier people. 
>> I'm going to let you in. We have someone else we are going to bring in. Thank you tio for being here on the show today but thank you for your work. Chicago is a city I love deeply. The model you are creating with cease-fire is one that can continue to be used in other cities.

>>> On thursday, after meeting with the white house gun violence task force, the nra slammed vice president biden calling the meeting part of an agenda to attack the second amendment. The nra may have walked away angrily their dominance guarantees their voice will continue to be heard as this develops. It brings me to 100,000. The number of new members to join nra since the massacre in newtown. A poll conducted last year by a republican pollster found 87% of nra members believe support for the second amendment includes keeping the guns out of the hands of criminals. It may be because the organization isn't simply an affinity group, but rather the public face of the firearm industry. An industry that stands to lose much more than membership dues if guns become a bit harder to distribute. The gun lobby isn't shooting with blanks. In 2011 alone, firearms industry was a $32 billion industry with gun ownership at a 20 year high. wUN AND AMMUNITION SALES RAKED In $4 billion last year. Gun makers are trying to keep it that way. Since 2005, corporate donors to the nra, the vast majority gun manufacturers not owners contributed $53 million to the organization. During the 2012 election, the nra had $3 million cash to play with because politics matter to the gun maker. Sometimes one politician can make millions for the firearm manufacturers. Since the election of president obama, despite a bear market, the firearms industry has seen stock prices jump by the hundreds. For one gun maker in particular, smith and wes son, it's went up. Black friday 154,873 background checks made for potential gun owners. December was a record breaking month with 2.2 million background checks for those wanting firearms. That's a staggering 58.6% increase over the year before. This is not a new phenomena. Gun sales spiked higher in the wake of the aurora, colorado movie shooting massacre. The same was true after columbine and the shooting in arizona that left gabby giffords wounded. Newtown has kept pace, especially with ammunition to fill high capacity magazines like the one used by adam lanza. The online vendor, the self-proclaimed world's largest supplier of firearm accessories had to apologize before christmas for being out of stock for many items including high capacity round holders. They sold 3.5 years worth of magazines in just 72 hours.

>>> There's a difference between the political and philosophical violence of guns in society and the oh too real effects of it. Jackie is joining us. She lost both of her sons to gun violence before their 30th birthdays. In 1982, her 17-year-old son was shot dead in new york by two men who didn't like the way he was looking at them. Then, almost two decades later, her second son was shot and killed by a 13-year-old involved in a robbery in a street outside his apartment in baltimore. In response to her pain, she co-founded mothers save. In addition toaking sure families who share her experience receive grief counseling and financial help, she's at the forefront to stop gun violence. 
>> Let me say thank you. It's an honor. Thank you for having the vision to bring on a mother who has endured the pain that is all centered around this gun violence. We have been out here a long time trying to get someone to pay attention to help us stop this violence, to help us understand why are they killing each other. Why are we having this organization? We started off with five mothers, melissa. We walked in an office and said help, help. There's too many guns on the streets. Who is giving our kids the guns. That is the question. We know where they are coming from. We know. Who is putting the guns in our kids hands? That is the question that was called w we stood on city hall. Now we have 50 plus mothers and fathers. We are glad to say they have a home and someplace to come. 

[00:46:25]


>> Let me go to this point. I think so many folks would say when we look at the newtown shooting, as horrible as it is, it is horrible, the loss of those children might at least begin to stem violence, if we can make real legislative accomplishments. Then I say you lost your boys, your first son in 1982. Then decades later, all that time passed and the rules were not changed in a way that made your second son any safer. How do we make sure there aren't 50 more? I'm happy you are an organization group but sad. I would like to know there were no more mothers who lost their sons and daughters. 
>> I'm sad it grew, but happy it grew. How do we stop it? First of all, it's a lot of attention paid to the gun violence now because of the newtown shooting. Whatever it takes. We have been out there a long time saying help, help. How we stop it? I am proud that the president and vice president have this task force and it's really looking at this. The world is looking at how to stop this violence. So, we have to come to the table, the communities -- let me talk ahe communities. What the communities can do. We have to support the president. We have to support the vice president. We have to talk to our congress. We have to talk to our legislatures and say enough is enough. Now we lost our babies. We been losing our kids forever. Now we have lost our babies. Enough is enough. Step up! Take charge! Take charge of our children. Stop letting them make money off our children's lives. 
>> Right. That feels like -- that feels like that is what it is. People are simply making money off the death of our children. 
>> Gun manufacturers. One of the things we can do, simply when you said where are the guns coming from, it's up to the bureau to figure out where the guns are coming from. For example, the atf doesn't have funding or personnel. Inventory checks to figure out where the stolen guns are coming from. The atf doesn't have the power to computerize gun sales. If you want to figure out where the guns are coming from, what they have to go through paper. That is a piece of legislation that has prevented the atf -- 

[00:48:57]


>> say it again. The atf has not had a director for six years? 
>> For six years. They cannot get one confirmed through. They have not had an atf director. There's also not a juvenile justice director, either. 
>> How a beginning to have a conversation about this if we n't have those positions filled? 
>> The gun lobby went out of their way to collect data by the cdc and others. It's an important conversation we can have to get more data and research to find out how gun laws work. There are certain laws that would work tomorrow to keep guns off the streets. Rightnow, 40% of all gunales in our country don't have a background check. That means -- that's not just -- sometimes it's trivialized calling it the gun show loophole. It's on the internet. You can go on the internet right now, convicted felon, sex abuser, terrorist. 40% is not a loophole. It's standard operating procedure. We are going to take a quick break.

>>> Gang violence accounts for 800 murders annually. A large percent are connected with drug trafficking. When we turn the tide of gun violence maybe ending the war on drugs is the best gun measure we can enact. Is that possible. It's driven by a public health problem? 
>> Absolutely. We need to end the war on drugs immediately. 
>> We have lost. 
>> President clinton said it's a failure. The president is taking steps to do so. The mandatory minimum sentencing has to be gotten rid of. We take our kids and manufacture them to become prisoners. We are to look at it in a concrete way. There's a piece of legislation by bobby scott out of virginia called the youth promise act with bipartisan approach. It looks at gang violence intervention to programs like here. It looks at programs and says can we take a community and rebuild a community? 
>> I just want to point out, though, it's very important to have conversations like this. This is a complex issue with complex solutions. We should have those conversations policy wise and culturally. We shouldn't have them at the expense of what we can do tomorrow to keep guns off the streets and out of the hands of dangerous people. There's a lot of gravity around the mental health. That's the pull it apart to talk about access, mental health services an important conversation. Let's talk about what we can do. There's certain mental illnesses where people are predisposed to harming themselves and others. Through education. That public health approach. You can educate parents and clinicians. Maybe it's not a great idea if he's predisposed to harming somebody to have an arsenal in your house. Always make sure, especially right now they are grounded in access to guns. 

[00:55:29]


>> Multiple conversations happening at the same time. 
>> Absolutely. We need to look more as you did before. Let's talk about bullying. A lot of mental illness and angriness come from bullying. These kids are bullied. Sometimes when you are pull bullied, the child got a gun and shot the kid. That plays a big part. So, what do we say to the educators? What do we say to the parents? What do we say to the children? Speak up. If you are scared, tell someone. Tell your family member. Tell your counselor. It is a speak up number as dan mentioned earlier. We have to really start paying attention and education. Do more education, put funding in educating these kids on bullying. We have a peer-to-peer program. 
>> Thank you for reminding us of that, dan. The layers lay on top of each other. There's the question of mental illness and the question of our social illnesses. None of that can be divorced from the policies that we can enact today and reduce the access to guns from everything from the internet to gun shows and all those things. This is complex. We spent an hour in it. I appreciate you all for being here. A couple of you are sticking around. Thank you for bringing your passion and experience to us. This is a tough one. 
>> We understand the fight. We going to stay with the mothers. Yesterday, a kid got shot across from harlem of the save. Legislatures listen to what the president proposed. I hope they make their best argument. 
>> We are changing gears dramatically next. We are going to try to lighten it up. We are going have a funny moment about amy poehler and tina fey as they take center stage.

[ Male Announcer ] BOB HAS AFIB: Atrial fibrillation not caused by a heart valve problem, a condition that puts him at greater risk for a stroke. 
[ Gps ] turn left. I don't think so. 
[ Male Announcer ] FOR YEARS, BOB TOOK WARFARIN, And made a monthly trip to the clinic to get his blood tested. But not anymore. Bob's doctor recommended a different option: Once-a-day xarelto????. Xarelto???? is the first and only once-a-day prescription blood thinner for patients with afib not caused by a heart valve problem that doesn't require routine blood monitoring. Like warfarin, xarelto???? is proven effective to reduce the risk of an afib-related stroke. There is limited data on how these drugs compare when warfarin is well managed. No routine blood monitoring means bob can spend his extra time however he likes. New zealand! Xarelto???? is just one pill a day, taken with the evening meal. And with no dietary restrictions, bob can eat the healthy foods he likes. Do not stop taking xarelto???? rivaroxaban ithout talking to the doctor who prescribes it for you. Stopping may increase your risk of having a stroke. Get medical help right away if you develop any signs or symptoms of bleeding, like unusual bruising or tingling. You may have a higher risk of bleeding if you take xarelto???? with aspirin products, nsaids or blood thinners. Talk to your doctor before taking xarelto???? if you currently have abnormal bleeding. Xarelto???? can cause bleeding, which can be serious, and rarely may lead to death. You are likely to bruise more easily on xarelto????, and it maye longer for bleeding to stop. Tell your doctors you are taking xarelto???? before any planned medical or dental procedures. Before starting xarelto????, tell your doctor about any conditions, such as kidney, liver or bleeding problems. Ready to change your routine? Ask your doctor about once-a-day xarelto????.

>>> Welcome back. I'm melissa harris perry. Nbc funny ladies, tina fey and amy poehler are hosting the awards. To be fair, there have been other women hosts. But poler and fey are the first duo to do it together. They were the first all female anchor team for "saturday night live's" weekend update. In 2013, it feels odd that established funny women like poler and fey are still creating firsts. All this in a week when the buzz is breaking for their golden globes moment but for jimmy kimmel's move to the sweet spot on abc. Right, because we don't have enough funny men in late night or government. Jimmy kimmel's move puts him against jay leno. There's still fallon, o'brien. Without them, we do. I can't forget, there are two funny ladies hosting late night. Chelsea handler and kelly griffith. Come on. Ladies are as funny. Tina and amy will prove it tonight. The problem is they have to keep proving it all the time. At the table, julian, president of benefitette college for women. Michael, editor and chief of globalgrind.Com, our guy at the table and funny lady extroud nar judy gold, writer, comedian and can be seen saturday january 19th at the landmark on main street in washington. So lovely to have you here. Judy, I have to start with you as a comedian and a lady. 

[01:03:01]


>> I wouldn't say I'm a lady. 
>> Yeah, right. Not on seven second delay here. Try to remember that. Look, why are women still fighting for space in the land of funny? 
>> To me, it's mind boggling. If you think about it, women are fighting for space in every profession except nursing or teaching. We haven't had a woman president, that is beyond ridiculous. When you think of women in comedy and the articles written about women in comedy, women aren't funny. People aren't funny. It has nothing to do with your gender. Humor is such a suggestive thing. You like pizza that is spicy or you don't. You like sarcasm or you dot. It's a sense. It is a sense of humor. Your sensibility might not match someone els. It has nothing to do with whether you are male or female. 
>> What we have developed as our sense of what makes something funny is our cultural development came to think of as the kind of things men do or say rather than the things women do or say. 
>> Our culture is so generalized. You have disparity. If you look at congress, 20% of it is woman. If you go to developing countries you ever a ministry of women, you may have a law that says half or a third of the people elected to office have to be women. You have genderized culture. Women aren't that funny. In fact, the women I think are hilarious, if they do household jokes, the guys don't get them. If they do sexual jokes they are -- don't do any below the belt, how can I put this? 
>> It really is about what women are supposed to act like. When I look at my mother, she says why do you have to talk, you're so loud. They were taught to be feminine you have to be passive. You have to be docile. 

[01:05:07]


>> Pretty. 
>> If you are not like that, you are not feminine. That is absolutely the problem where women are afraid to speak up. Afraid to be opinionuated. 
>> The other piece of it for me and probably you as well looking at race, gender and culture, the ways african-american women are more sidelined. The jokes we can tell have to do with weight. 
>> Mammy is so funny. She'll show up over and over again. When you see the black woman joke. 
>> The lotto. You have all these black men, some of them have h late night. Some of them are this side of obscene. I have a nephew who is a comedian and I have to go to church afterward. 
>> On a tuesday. 
>> It is amazing how we have allowed, women have allowed, because we watch these men. If they didn't have ratings, of course, I don't think any of those guys are that funny. 
>> We have a little bit of data. I know sometimes people say you are just making it up. It's not that bad. I want to show data. There's a great new study showing the gender and balances alive and well in media. We have one table showing the indicators that women are seen and not heard. When we look at girls, all these forms of media, there's a lot of numbers. Look at the top left. Just the percentage of female characters in family films. These are in family films. The percent of characters is up over 30%. When you start asking about the likelihood of speaking rolls, there's even in children's stories, not even 50% in terms of percentages in female characters in prime time, children's stories and family films. You are in the industry. How do we breakthrough those barriers? 

[01:07:15]


>> I think the best way to breakthrough the barriers is celebrate and honor the achievements of those who do breakthrough. When a woman breaks and shatters the glass ceiling, we need to celebrate that as you pointed out this week. If jimmy kimmel was the lead story, but yet the duo of hosting the globes was secondary to that, that's a problem. Young people can only aspire to be what they see. We celebrate certain industries and certain individuals but then we really let certain stories fly below the radar which isn't smart. For a young woman, she believes she can only be historically what she has always been. For us, it's important to put certain figures and certain individuals in places where we celebrate their accomplishments and achievements so other people can use that illuminating path as a blueprint for their own individual success. 
>> I'm wondering if one of the things we should be celebrating is dual women. It's two women. Not having to play the girl in a team or -- 
>> a side kick. 
>> We are both playing the girl. Then the girl can be a multiplicity of different roles. As a token male on the panel here, men may not be happy with me as I'm a proud feminist. My grandmother was a feminist and my mother wauz feminist. What I find is we areeeing advances in front of the south korean. Kerry washington in scandal. Tina in "30 rock." Behind the camera, you can't name five female directors on one hand. Kathryn hardwick or bigelow. Nora ephron just passed. That's really it. 
>> If you can name them on one hand and one is passed away. 
>> The beauty is you have debra martin chase who has been very successful. Her name is not top of mind. 

[01:09:20]


>> Who in hollywood has the right to green light a film? Many women can green light a film. 
>> We are going to come back with that topic. It's a celluloid feeling. 

[01:12:58]


>>> It's true that women have made great strides in hollywood. Thursday's nomination for best director may signal the road ahead is long. "Zero dark thirty" is nominated for best picture. The director, kathryn bigelow, the first to win the best director for "hurt locker" not nominated. Her movie was good enough for a nomination, but she wasn't. 
>> I think the film is fantastic. She is one of my favorite directors. It's important to talk about the decision makers. When you have a kathryn bigelow at the helm of the film and jessica playing a powerful female character. It changes how we see women on the screen. If you look at will and grace, it laid the groundwork for a shift in this country. Women are making decisions and who represents them on screen. I believe it can change culture. 
>> You ask the question. Who has the power to green light films? We often hear they are responding to audience pressure. It has to do with what makes the big dollars. There's an organization, women in the audience supporting women artists now. We go and watch women's films. Is there something other than organizing to appreciate women that is actively asking the industry to do something different. 
>> I think one of the things women can do in addition to organizing is funding the films. You have alternative women's organizations. I know we are going to talk later about our sortie. Delta sigma beta starred rudy. THIS WAS IN THE '7s. It was a long time ago. They put the money up because we don't see enough black women in positive roles, we don't see enough african-americans in positive roles, we will pay for it ourselves. It was a long shot and very challenges. We have more women with wealth where women control wealth than men. Look at the sisters who had the dollar said okay, I'm going to put $5 million behind this film starring women. Let's see what happens. The other thing is we support these men. Very interesng survey in the EARLY '80s THAT MANY MAGAZINE Did that talked about sexism. Most women, many of the women talked about in the margins what about my sons. You are looking at affirmative action. What about my sons? What about you? You have to put yourself first. Strong women raise strong sons. 

[01:15:46]


>> It's the media that plays into this. A woman's film is a chick flick. 
>> Like "zero dark thirty". 
>> You saying how many female characters? That's a woman's movie. Every other movie isn't a guy's movie, it's just a guy's movie. You have stand-up comedy. Three women on a show. It's ladies night out. Three guys on a show, it's a regular show. It's the way that we are publicized and marketed and oh, she's on the edge because she said this. He's not on the edge. 
>> It's not a small point. Even when we do this table, right? This table does not come together week in and week out without thought about who is sitting here. There's no doubt you can have a sunday morning show with an all male panel and take no remark at all. If the show is entirely women from beginning to end, it's ladies night. Oh, our ladies panel. 
>> It's the way -- we do that. We do that. 
>> It's fueled by financing. One would argue they could always say this is what works. So, if they do bridesmaids and it does $300 million and they do a film that really focuses on the family or the female friendship and relationship and under performs, there is the problem. It's a reflection of what actually works in hollywood. 
>> Why is it that one movie doesn't do well so they don't make more movies like that? 
>> Again, hollywood is -- they are not leaders, but followers. It's like reality television. When the first show happened, everyone was afraid of it. Largely, society is supported. If you are a sitcom, it's like an anomaly. The fact is consumers are in control of what works in hollywood and hollywood is really going to shape their programming and green lighting of films based on what they think works. A film maker can cast who he would like to cast because funding is coming from independent sources. We want this person, we want that person. You have more freedom. You can take more risk. 

[01:18:09]


>> I want to be a tiny bit careful about the idea that audiences have a total menu to choose and choose sexist and problematic. One thing is about the presence of women and the other is about what kind of portrayal of women we get whether women are standing there or not. I think we always want to separate an essentialist body. We can have women producing equally problematic silencing. I hate cultural policing. Like in the sense that you can be obscene and gro test k. When it's the same image as black women as mammy all the time and produced by black men and woman. It's no longer interesting. 
>> The whole thing about the stereotypes and the things about the film is we haven't broken the cultural barrier of petri ar ki. When you have 50% of the congressmen or 50% of the senate being men, 50% of college presidents are women, you know, when you see women equal, then you begin to see that reflected in the movies. I disagree with you about what they think is going to work. I think it's what they think about life. It's also -- 
>> I wonder which comes first. I'm going to let you in next, first. I want to talk a little bit about girls. We are talking women, if you are a girl coming up in this industry, what does it look like? One way to talk about it is a 12-year-old's hair. lisa, quit.

This is a world with women and girls are constantly reminded they don't belong to themselves tharks bodies are not their own or power of self-determination. I made a promise to endow my little girl with the power to know her body, spirit and mind are her domain. 
>> Where was she when I was growing up. 
>> I know. 
>> Good job, momma. 
>> When you have a moment like that, attacking the hair choices of a 12-year-old, it made me feel sad. 
>> It's such a violation. Here you have a kid who is 12. It's probably the worst age for a girl anyway. She's finding herself. Her hormones are developing and you are criticizing her because she cut her hair. She made a decision that she feels pretty or attractive or likes herself this way and the media has to come in, what does this mean? This is not feminine. It's really just so destructive. If a guy cuts his hair, oh, would you he's really butch and manly. Yeah, he's manly. What does her song mean? She's depressed. No, she's an intelligent insightful girl. 
>> Taking risk. Wallace, the youngest best actress nominee ever, a little african-american girl who played in "beast of the southern wild." She was an incredible actor in this firm and does it with her own natural hair. It felt like this point. When you take a risk. When you don't assume what the audience wants to see, great and amazing things might come out of it. 

[01:25:12]


>> Absolutely. I was thinking of gabby, the young woman -- 
>> gabby douglas. 
>> The thing that hurt me most, while a lot of people criticize her, african-american women were the most violent. She didn't press her hairs. If you are running on the bars, if you press it, it's going to go back. Jada is right. What young woman has to be able to do is own themselves. You have girls in the fourth and fifth grade telling people they are fat. They are growing. It doesn't matter. You have folks who tell you they are ugly. Sometimes they are ugly because their skin is dark. All these stereotypes that seep through again and we haven't dealt with. We have to tell our girls. Otherwise, they won't be women who own themselves. 
>> That is dangerous. We are supporting the mind set we are allowing them to not be fearless and unafraid to be different in a sea of the same. In hollywood, when you look at her parents, when you look at will smith who many consider modest as a rapper but monumental success as an actor and someone who used his own identity and dunn it his way. The same with jada pinkett smith. They have been fearless. They are the parents of the children. I celebrate the fact that you should go to hollywood or any industry as we all have done and bring your own unique individualalty. That is what will be celebrated, when you take a risk and ender the risk business, they tend to fly and soar. I think when you hear criticism, it's often other people projecting their insecurity. What bothered me about the gabby douglas debackal is we should have been more focused on her talent rather than her look. At times she will evolve and change. It's about the talent. We send the wrong message. 

[01:27:15]


>> May I suggest say you take a risk and have a sense of self-ownership and fail in hollywood, it might be the better trade off. 
>> Women fail once. Men can fail over and over and over. 
>> That is not a small point. 
>> Right. 
>> The other thing with willow smith is hair growth is a human function. 
>> Age related, too. 
>> So all of this, if she doesn't like it, she can grow it back, she can twist it. 
>> When you are a black woman, the hair growth may affect it but it's a commodity available in forms and function. We can make choices very quickly. This is always a useful conversation. At least we will join in and watch golden globes and have a good time laughing at two funny ladies that deserve to be there. Thank you for being our guy on the panel. You are so you. You are fearless. 
>> With no hair. 
>> Up next, we are going to talk a little bit about the other side of this. How do we get girls to own themselves? We are going to talk about educating our girls. Do they learn better than boys?

>>> The 113th congress boasts a record number of women serving in the nation. 20 in the senate, 80 in the house. It's more than any other time in history. 60% of the women now in congress, including 70% of women senators were once girl scouts. So, could the answer to fostering more women leaders in our country be young girls spending more time exclusively with other young girls? It's a question debated round and round the community with no easy answer. There's the argument young boys are unruly. Or that girls have fewer chances to speak in class as aggressive boys seek the attention. The evidence is not convincing. Single sex advocates like the national association for single sex public education hosts studies like this one online. Rarchers conducted a study where fourth grade students were in a single sex or coed classroom. When it came to tests, 30% of boys scored efficient compared to 80% of boys in single sex classrooms. For girls, 59% scored efficient. Those numbers from the 2005 are not conclusive. They are heavily debated. The u.S. Department of education says on the question of single sex education, there's a dearth of studies. Support of single sex schooling, a limited number of studies. For now, the debate coinues. Still with me, julian malveaux, president of the college for women. Joining us is nancy lesko at teacher's college at columbia university. The principal of girls lower east middle school in manhattan and tracy meres, professor of law at yale law scho what should we think about the numbers? 

[01:33:58]


>> One of the studies you didn't cite was from a coalition of women's colleges. What they found is women who go to women's colleges are more likely to step up in terms of leadership positions, have more opportunities to lead or talk. At a women's college, all leadership positions are women. Whether it's the head of the naacp, they are being trained to be leaders. One of the things I find that was troubling to me, one of the -- after a random act of violence, one of the women decided all the colleges should get together to stop the violence march. It was her idea. As soon as the guys got to the table, they dominated the conversation. It was their world. It was so bad. I could hear the voices all the way down in my office. Who let the kids from amt in here. I walked down. I'm like sister, this is your meeting. Run your meeting. Do not let these guys run your meeting. Oftentimes women defer when a man comes in the room. We have to do more education. I think the results for a women's college coalition talk about the major benefits. 
>> Give me the pushback on this. You have been on multiple sides of this. 
>> One of the pushbacks for me, there are a number of them. One is, as the whole segment indicates, there are gender issues in schooling. I totally agree with that and think we need to explore those. I think part of what the single sex -- the way the single sex school debate functions is it says here is the answer. We never go on to say, well, what is going on and can we -- i think the single sex debate presumes you can separate what goes on in school from what goes on outside of school. So, I think exactly what julian was saying, thedea of being able to, you know, articulate ideas well, forcefully, challenge ideas et cetera. All those things are very important. But, they can be learned at the dinner table as well as they can in a classroom. 

[01:36:22]


>> The point you are making right now, there has to be one answer as if there's one question. It depends on what the question is. If we are talking achievement on tests, that's one question. How we think about single sex education might depend on what age we are talking about. I have a 6-year-old. My 6-year-old boy is different than the way my 6-year-old girls acted. Maybe a boy will do better in a single sex classroom at a certain age. You are talking college and leadership potential, which is a different question. It seems we ought t asking, you know, the answer for what question. 
>> I say two of the keywords you mentioned so far is single sex education provide choice and voice. Is a single sex education required for every single girl to thrive in this world? No. Should they not be afforded the opportunity? On the subject of voice, it's critical or girls learn there are ways to defie stereo types, expectations that our girls it doesn't matter how they look and do their hair but how they express themselves and do their homework and become activists in our society. 
>> I want to ask -- I want a ask a little bit about that. My daughter, we chose single sex ed for her. That's where she is now. She is now in middle school. The fact is, it's not as though it's all girls holding hands and clapping and singing in girl joy. Not that there's -- sometimes it is odd. Sometimes you take gender away as the primary dividing line other things come to the floor. There can still be bullying and ways of saying this is the person who is on the out and this is the person on the in. 
>> You can't remove every distraction a girl is going to face. We can remove one major distraction and provide a fertile ground for them to see themselves differently where the strongest mathematician in the school is a girl. The strongest athlete is a girl. There is no space for gender and equality in our school. 

[01:38:34]


>> We are going to stay on this topic. Immaterial to bring in the point you brought in about colleges. Women's colleges are in a different place. It worked for hillary clinton and for martha stewart. Should more young women do it? mickelson. I've been fortunate to win on golf's biggest stages. But when joint pain and stiffness from psoriatic arthritis hit, even the smallest things became difficult. I finally understood what serious joint pain is like. I talked to my rheumatologist and he prescribed enbrel. Enbrel can help relieve pain, stiffness, and stop joint damage. Enbrel may lower your ability to fight infections. Serious, sometimes fatal events including infections, tuberculosis, lymphoma, other cancers, nervous system and blood disorders, and allergic reactions have occurred. Before starting enbrel, your doctor should test you for tuberculosis and discuss whether you've been to a region where certain fungal infections are common. You should not start enbrel if you have an infection like the flu. Tell your doctor if you're prone to infections, have cuts or sores, have had hepatitis b, have been treated for heart failure, or if you have symptoms such as persistent fever, bruising, bleeding, or paleness.

>>> We have been talking about the case for single sex education for girls through 12th grade. What about beyond? There are 47 colleges and yurnts across the u.S. Facing an unusual and troubling trend, declining enrollment. Cart the statistics, enrollment stood at 85,769 in 2010. It's down from an estimated 113,000 in 1998. That's despite the examples set from the school's most impressive alum. Graduates include former secretary of state, madeleine albright, hillary clinton and pamela melroy. Writer and author anna quindlen and martha stewart. From spellman college, marian wrighted elman an advocate for the disadvantaged. Can the case be made for all women in a college environment? You have been the president of such a school. 
>> One of the things people think is a single sex school is all women. We have some male professors. The tilt is female, but we have male professors. They are not sitting in a convent. You have other school that are close by. So, none of these children or young people are being koiserred. It's an important point to make. A lot of them think they are going to be. However, I think there are lots of benefits. There are some disadvantages. There are 4,000 plus colleges in the united states. 4,000. You have clernlg colleges for african-american. 45 women's colleges. You have one founded for jewish people, why not variety? I didn't go to a single sex school. A lot of womenho are achievers didn't. Some want to make that choice. They want to learn and be focused. They want to have the opportunity to learn without the distraction of young men in the room and they are being prepared to go into a world with all the tools that make them unintimidated by men. They have learned how to argument. 

[01:44:16]


>> If the data are, at best mixed, about k-12 and test score results. We feel all kind of ways about what it tells us. Are the data mixed about the sort of leadership capacity potential around women's colleges? 
>> I'm much more familiar with the research around k-12 schools. I'm going to speak to those then see if we can extrapolate. One of the questions I want to kind of interject here is to what degree we can assume all single sex schools or programs are identical and have similar emphasis. For example, there was a study IN THE EARLY 200s OF 12 Different single sex schools in california. They varied widely in terms of the curriculum, in terms of leadership, in terms so california made funds available. Some programs were about getting extra funds. They had no leadership that wanted to push feminist knowledge or feminist awarenesses. 
>> The variables that make it that may be producing it -- along with a single sex ed, but not causal. 
>> It may be a selective factor. 
>> Who opes into them. 
>> And who drops out and who is left. 
>> Opting in, I did not opt in to a single sex environment. My parents are like there you go. I went kicking and screaming. I didn't realize the benefits of going to a single sex school. In college, I realized I had a certain confidence, I was the one with my hand up. I was the scholar going to my teacher to advocate for myself ensuing a sense of confidence. The way it happened was in my 7th through 12th education, teachers were looking out to an introverted 12-year-old for leadership skills. Those are the sorts of opportunities and focus on individual identity that we can afford our girls. 

[01:46:36]


>> What nancy is saying is that doesn't necessarily follow from single sex education. I think about this from the standpoint I have a 13-year-old. We are considering where to send her to high school and one of the options is a single sex catholic high school. You know, what's interesting to me as I sit and listen to all of you speak is what I'm looking for is good schooling. 
>> Right. 
>> Good schooling is really the issue. You are talking teachers that draw you out. It's not obvious to me that one needs to be in a single sex environment for that to take place. 
>> Varies for each individual. 
>> Where are women going to be celebrated? Women, my tag line is we are at a place where young women are educated, celebrated and developed into leaders and gl thinkers, educated and celebrated. When you walk through a hauway, you see pictures of women. When you see leadership, it's women. 
>> Does it let the coed schools off the hook? The one thing I wonder is if we do that, then, in fact, do general public schools not need to celebrate women's history month in march and not make sure that in fact, 50% of women, 50% of their leaders are women. You need a single sex ed it lets coed schools off the hook. 
>> It doesn't let them off the hook. So you really want to make sure that diversity is basically pushed and celebrated. 50% of law professors at yale, i don't know the numbers but I'm certain it's not 50%. 
>> I was the first african-american tenured professor at yale law school. 
>> I wonder if the other place -- you made the point about the dinner table. We made the point about girl scouts. Say we go to coed schools or single ed school. 

[01:48:46]


>> Within girls prep middle schools, in our elementary schools, we have underlying core values that can only happen in a uniquely single sex environment. Incing sisterhood. Despite what you are seeing of women tearing each other down, they are building each other up. They are sisters. They are named after a strong female leader. 
>> Opposite of the "real housewives." 
>> There are challenges of finding the needs of each individual scholar. I can speak from personal experience. The way my brother and I learned was different. Also the way my sister and i learned were different. With the core values we try to view within the girls to reach the goals. 
>> We are in our last 30 seconds of the conversation. Professor, there's something you wanted to do in the last 30 seconds. 
>> Absolutely. On behalf of us, I have brought you something. 
>> Great. 
>> It is our centennial celebration, 100 years of phenomenal women who war ched, not only marched down pennsylvania avenue, bull marching, but we marched anyway. We are celebrating. And you are -- 
>> I greatly appreciate it. In fact, what I'm going to do as soon as we come back from the break is I'm going to talk about delta sigma theta sorority for those of you who may not know, it is our 100-year anniversary. It's our birthday today. And I actually think there's something in the conversation we've just had about women's leadership that I want to share about my sors when we come back. ?????? I'm living in a kind of daydream ?????? more lose because for every 2 pounds you lose through diet and exercise, alli can help you lose one more by blocking some of the fat you eat. Let's fight fat with alli. ?????? ?????? happen anyone! Stress sweat is different than ordinary sweat. It smells worse. Get 4x the protection against stress sweat. Introducing new secret clinical strength stress response scent. w?? 100 years ago today on JANUARY 13th, 1913, 22 YOUNG Women at howard university established delta sigma theta sorority. The deltas were founded at a time when women did not have the right to vote, when african-americans were second-class citizens, and when black women were concentrated in the exploitive drudgery of domestic work. As college students these young women understood this their education meant they had relative privilege, and founding delta sigma theta was a response to that opportunity. A chance to nurture social bonds between one another and to serve their broader community. Now, for those of you unfamiliar with the traditions of african-american greek letter organizations, I know it might seem odd to talk about a sorority centennial on a political show. But delta sigma theta is not exclusively or even primarily an organization for college women. Delta, like other historically black sororities and fraternities of the national panaletic council has a history rooted in economic, social, political engagement. Delta is the organization that first introduced me to the accomplishments of many black women in american politics. Patricia roberts harris, the first african-american woman to be appointed to a presidential cabinet. Shirley chisholm, the first african-american woman elected to the u.S. House and the first to run for president. Barbara jordan, the first black woman elected to the u.S. House from the south. Carol moseley braun, the only african-american woman u.S. Senator. All women who chose to affiliate with delta. Delta is the organization where I had my first opportunities to practice leadership. As an undergraduate chapter president I learned basic skills like robert's rules of order, honed more intangible abilities like forming consensus among extremely diverse points of view, and I had my share of good times at step shows. Women take many paths to leadership. Delta was the first one i followed. Now, it is not a perfect organization. Like many of our counterparts, deltas have been complicit in the excesses of college hazing and have sometimes squandered rather than mobilized our political and economic resources. But perfection is not the standard. Commitment is. I make no claim that this organization is better than any other. But I believe the commitments of the more than 200,000 college and graduate members, of making our selves and our community and our nation better is a story worth noting. Today is delta sigma theta's 100th birthday. Happy birthday, sorors. That's our show for today. Thank you to julianne malvo, to nancy, kaitlin, tracy, and thank you to you at home for watching.

=======================================================

Gaxar, viva la squid. 
>> I'm drew griffin at the cnn world headquarters in atlanta, thank you for joining me tonight. Don lemon will return next weekend. Have a great night and a great week. 
>>> Barack obama is entering his second term, only the third democratic president to be re-elected in the last 75 years. He faces deep domestic challenges. Above all, a still weak economy. He faces a world in flux and in crisis from iran and syria to north korea and china. Perhaps most visibly, he faces a domestic political deadlock that seems to rshadow all else. With this hand what can he do? What will he do? I've asked for advice from the states men and women who have stood beside presidents as they have made their most difficult decisions, from republicans like james baker -- 
>> we didn't have a dollar, a de facto reserve currency in the world, we would be greece. 
>> Rober rubin. 
>> In a democracy you can only move forward if both sides are willing to come together to govern. 
>> And independents like michael bloomberg. 
>> When you have jobs that we need to get done but americans won't take, letting the crops rot or letting the farms move south of the border is just insanity. 
>> At the end I'll write my own memo to the president. Let's get started. 
>>> While most of the world was ringing in the new year with revelrie, the united states congress rang it in with anger, strife and confusion. The angry battle over the fiscal cliff was emblematic of one of the crisis facing this nation. Politics is so divided, so bitter, that even kicking the can down the road is almost impossible to get agreement on. What to do? Ronald reagan faced a majority in the house of representatives and he still got legislation passed including a major tax reform bill. James baker was treasury secretary at the time. 

[00:02:27]


>> I think the only time it's ever been done, at least in 100 years, and we did it with democratic votes. With ronald reagan as president. We did it with democratic votes. Danny rostenkowski, was not going to come up with a bill that was not prodemocrat. The question was whether we were going to sign on to that bill, pass it in the house and try to fix it in the republican senate? Our republican house members came to us and said, if you try to do that, we're going to roll you. Dick cheney, trent lott, they all came down to my office, they said, if you go forward with this rotenkowski bill, we're going to roll you. And they rolled us on the rule. They defeated us on the rule. I went over to the white house and said mr. President, you have to come out in favor of the rostenkowski bill. Guess what, after a while, he did it. He did it. We did it, and that's how we got there. It was successful and shaded a period of extraordinary economic growth. 
>> But you're describing a situation where you had to do a lot of compromising. You stood up to house republicans. You supported a democratic bill. It's difficult to imagine in today's partisan climate. 
>> I think president obama could do that. President obama wants a legacy. He deserves one. He's not going to have a legacy if he can't fix our economy. 
>> Kay bailey hutchison is the recently retired senior senator fromtexas. 
>> Had is his time to step out from his base and away from the fringes on both ends and say here is what our country needs right now. 

[00:04:29]


>> Ken dubersteen, chief of staff in ronald reagan's second term thinks that point about stepping out from your base is even more important since obama's re-election. 
>> The second term is the art of governing, not the art of campaigning. They're very different skill sets. And the art of governing you have very much to almost make love to your opponents and so no to some of your fiercest supporters. And campaigning, it's the exact opposite. You have to figure out ways that you can accomplish things. Realizing that time is an enemy. Get as much done as you can, but don't over reach. 
>> What you're suggesting is that president obama needs to make love to the republicans and betray the democrats who have to elect him? 
>> I wouldn't use the word betray as much as I would say that sometimes it takes the ability to say yes to your opponents. And no to some of your fiercest supporters. 
>> A lot of people say president obama should be is monthsing a lot, he should be playing golf with john boehner, have republicans over. Do you think that kind of thing produces real results? 
>> No, I think it's not just atmospherics, if I'm negotiating with you, and I have in the back of my head I can trust what you tell me, we're much more likely to get to an agreement. 
>> President barack obama's car czar says that republicans in congress today are just unwilling to cooperate. 
>> The president may have spent more time in the first term reaching out to congressmen playing golf with them, having them to the white house, certainly couldn't hurt, couldn't make things worse, that's for sure. Might have helped. At the same time, I think people who went to see the movie lincoln, and said, if we only had lincoln in the white house we could have passed any amendment we wanted. If we only had lbj in the white house, we would have the civil rights act again are kidding themselves, this is a different era.

>> Robert rubin was secretary of the treasury during another partisan time. 
>> How did you deal with republicans on the hill for something like the '97 budget agreement, while they were trying to impeach president clinton. 
>> The partisan divide was bad. I think it's worse today. I think we have to do exactly what president obama said right after the election. 
>> I'm not whetted to every detail of my plan. I'm open to compromise. I'm open to new ideas. I'm committed to solving our fiscal challenges. But I refuse to accept any approach that isn't balanced. 
>> In a democracy, you can only move forward if both sides are willing to come together to govern, that's what we've been lacking. Without it, I think we're going to be in terrible trouble. 
>> Bill clinton's chief of staff says that presidents can make things happen, even without congressional support. 
>> The president has enormous power under the constitution and the laws of the united states. I'll give you an example, he has authority to change the mix of energy in the country through the use of existing powers that he has under the statutes. Particularly, the work that he could do through his epa to move the more dirty forms of polluting fuels to cleaner fuels. 
>> It might be hard to make it happen, but james baker's point holds, president obama will need to get some help from republicans if he wants to get things done. Otherwise, it's just talk. If he could get 30 to 40 house republicans on his side, obama would have created a governing majority. Something every successful president has had. Next up, the economy.

>>> Fixing the american economy is the most urgent crisis president obama faces. Despite the recovery, unemployment remains high. Growth isn't where we would like it to be. And the national debt has grown to historic proportions. The bill signed in the wake of the fiscal cliff crisis is a small fix. Is there a larger one? Once again, james baker. 

[00:12:12]


>> What would be your advice to president obama? 
>> My advice to president obama is, mr. President, whatever happens in the second term, you're going to bear the consequences of. Our country is in sick shape financially. Economically, we're really in bad shape. If we didn't have the dollar, the de facto reserve we would be greece. It's not going to be fixed without leadership from you. The republicans maintain control of the house. And we have divided government, he has to take the lead. He may score some short term victories over the republicans. In the meaning of long term, it's hienchilada. 
>> President clinton, secretary of the treasury, robert rubin. 
>> When people look at what president obama should do. There are a number of people who say, well, he's got to get the fiscal house in order, he's got to deal with the deficit. Why is that important? 
>> I think it's important to design a sound fiscal program that both contributes to job creation and recovery in the short term, I absolutely believe programs do that by creating confidence and creating fiscal room for a moderate stimulus. And also meets long term imperative for addressing what i believe is an unsustainable and dangerous fiscal trajectory. In order to put ourselves on a sound fiscal footing, we're going to have to have substantially more revenues and more revenues means higher taxes whether it's the tax rates or reduced deduction, one or the other, that clearly is going to be a cost absorbed by those who pay the taxes, there are going to have to be constraints on our programs. That's what you have to do if you're going to get on a sound fiscal path, the longer you wait, the deeper your whole gets the harder it is to retain confidence. 

[00:14:16]


>> It's time to redue the country's convoluted tax system. The u.S. Tax code is now 73,000 pages long. Paul o'neill treasury secretary under george w. Bush has an idea. 
>> You really want to scrap the entire u.S. Tax code? 
>> Yes. 
>> Why? 
>> Because it's inefficient, ineffective and fundamentally unfair. So I believe this. The revenue system should be used to raise money, shouldn't be organized to distribute benefits. 
>> No tax deductions? 
>> No deductions, no credits, no nothing. It's to raise revenue. And ideally, we should two it with a progressive value added tax, that means -- 
>> that's a national sales tax, correct? 
>> Well, it's not quite. Progressive is important to me, I don't want people to pay taxes if they have $20,000 a year worth of income. But at 30,000, I might like for people to pay $1. Just $1. So they have a legitimate claim for saying, I'm part of the society, and I don't pay a lot, but I do pay something. Everybody participates, and there's no game playing, it's a very efficient way to raise revenue. Right now, it costs us $431 billion a year to administer the tax system we have, and the tax gap, the money we're not collecting that's theoretically owed is $400 billion a year. We could do better than that, we can think better than that. And the president needs to lay that out for us. 
>> Even if we get more growth, we're still finding it difficult to get unemployment down. Elaine cho served as george w. Bush's secretary of labor. What would you do to create more jobs in america? 
>> I think you have to keep the tax rate low, they're a direct burden on the resources of the employer. The unemployment rate has dropped to 7.7%, but that's primarily because the labor participation rate has dropped to 63.6%, one of the lowest rates that we have seen in current years. What we're seeing actually is a lot of discouraged workers, people who can't find jobs and they're just giving up and they're no longer working and they're not counted in the workforce any more. We have to do better on the job creation side, it's the private sector who does the bulk of the hiring, and they have to have the confidence. And that comes from a more reasonable taxation level, and the fiscal discipline that we need in our country to restore our country's overall financial ratings. 

[00:17:00]


>> Democrats say what's most important is a stable predict an set of rules, whatever the levels of taxation. Steven radnor helped general motors get back into the black as president obama's car czar. 
>> One of the things people say that president obama needs to do is to create a sense of confidence among the business community which will drive investment, which will drive jobs. How does he do that? 
>> I think the president is off to a much better start, I think we need to have a set of policies in place which does involve congress that are long term. We knead to have long term tax policy, budget policy. Not doing this a few months at a time. Not careening from a debt ceiling to a fiscal cliff and tax credits that expire every few months. Somehow the government as a whole has to come together to give business the confidence it needs. 
>> The single most important cost that we need to get under control is health care. Which now takes up 17% of gdp and still rises much faster than inflation every year. Peter orzag ran president obama's office of management and budget during the first term. He says obama care moves us away from a bad model, where doctors and hospitals have a financial incentive to sell you lots of services. >>Ting health care costs down is fundamental to the long term fiscal health of the country. What does it need to do in the second term? 
>> We don't need to wait until 2020. The big gap that remains is medical malpractice reform. What I would favor is finding a safe harbor to a doctor, if you can show you're following an evidence based protocol, i shouldn't be able to sue you. 
>> Tax and health care reform would have huge benefits. But getting them done will be hard. 

[00:19:04]


>>> Coming up next, is there an easy win for the president and the country? Actually, yes. Immigration reform. Stay with us. doing? Nothing. Are you stealing our daughter's school supplies and taking them to work? No, I was just looking for my stapler and my... This thing. I SAVE MONEY BY USING FedEx GROUND And buy my own supplies.

Now that's like sunblock before or sun burn cream later. Oh, somebody out there's saying, now I get it! Take beano before and there'll be no gas. 

[00:23:01]


>>> I'm fareed zakaria, welcome back to memo to the president. On the domestic front in addition to the economy, president obama faces many pressing issues that will demand attention in his second term. One seems right for a solution. Immigration reform. James baker, ronald reagan's chief of staff explains why. 
>> Nothing concentrates the mind like being out of power for four years, okay? I think that republican attitudes are going to change. Hopefully they'll change in the aftermath of this most recent electoral defeat. Everybody knows that the hispanic vote was very important to what happened. 
>> Bill clinton's chief of staff agrees. A grand bargain on immigration is now possible. 
>> Immigration I think we've seen just the sea changes as a result of the election. That really is because of the collapse of the latino vote for republicans. We saw it drop from 44 pshs from president bush in 2004 to 22% for governor romney. That's the fastest growing part of the voting population. And so I think the republicans know they have gotten themselves into a dark place. And they need to come out of that place. And they need to deal with the people who are here, who are contributing to our society. Get them legal -- get them on a path to citizenship. 
>> First of all, we need to beef up our border security. Republicans like that, you need some sort of a photo i.D., social security card with biometric identification. Item number three whob a guest worker program p.M. And the fourth item ought to be registering the 12 to 20 million illegal aliens who are here in the country today and giving them the right to travel and to work temporarily, provided they are not criminals, they pay their back taxes and they pay a small penalty for having broken the law in the first place. 

[00:25:12]


>> Let me push you on that. If you don't provide a path to citizenship -- 
>> I don't think you can say -- that part of my four-point program is going to be attacked by amnesty by everybody -- by many people over on the republican side. But it's not amnesty. 
>> If they don't become citizens, what -- 
>> they have a path to citizenship. They do the way every other immigrant does to become an american citizen. 
>> What would you say to the republicans who would say, these guys should be deported. 
>> I understand that, and think what you say to them, look at what your position got us in this last election. We need to pay attention to demographics, okay? I said we n to be the party of hope and opportunity not the party of anger and resentment. 
>> Illegal immigration is just one problem with our current system. The mayor of new york city and one of america's most successful businessmen. 
>> Bloomberg believes that the current legal system is also hurting our international competitiveness. 
>> We let in lots of people from all over the world to study at american universities. 
>> Yes. 
>> Particularly in science and engineering? 
>> Yes. 
>> And then we throw them out. How would you fix the visa system? 
>> You attach a green card to the diploma for any graduate student that gets a masters or a Ph.D. IN ANY OF THE STEM AREAS, Science and technology. Then you have more h 1 b visas, companies can use those to get people here. Then you have to, if somebody is willing to start a business and can get financing, you certainly want to give them a visa, because they will go and start businesses for americans, and lastly, when you have jobs that we need to get done but americans won't take like working in the fields, letting the crops rot or letting the farms move south of the border is just insanity, we need to get people in here. 

[00:27:12]


>> I here by declare -- 
>> that's a sensible solution that might actually happen. There's also a sensible plan that seems a longshot. Both parties see the problem. Our nation's roads and power lines, bridges and water pipes are literally falling apart. The problem is, nobody wants to do anything about it. 
>> Good morning, everyone. 
>> Ed rendell has a new book out, he says the solution is simple. 
>> As governor, I inherited a state that had the highest number of structurally deficient bridges in the nation. I borrowed a lotf money, put it into bridge repair, the stimulus helped us mightily, that was one of the reasons that pennsylvania had the lowest unemployment rate of any industrial state in the union. There was something called build america bonds. The federal government said to the states, if you want to do major development and major construction projects, we will help you defray 35% of the interest payments, but it ran out when stimulus ran out, in an effort to reauthorize that as a separate program was turned down. The beauty of it is, very little impact on federal treasury, incredible impact on the amount of projects we can get going. This isn't rocket science, it's not like finding a disease to cure alzheimer's, parkinsons or cancer. We know what the answers are, we know what the cure to the problem,and all it takes is political courage. 
>> Kay bailey hutchison is the recently retired senior senator from texas. 
>> I would ask the president to submit an infrastructure bank, and it would leverage your public money wrivate money. About a 50/50 split. And it would have a revenue stream so you would be assured the government would be paid back, and bring that money that is sitting on the sidelines into making a real effort to build highways, bridges, electricity grids, all kinds of infrastructure needs that are not being met now that could be done with lower amounts of taxpayer dollars and that would end up being a revolving fund. 

[00:29:27]


>> In fact, the president has submitted just such a plan. But congress doesn't want to bank the broths based on merit. Much as they protest publicly, congressmen and women actually like pork.

>>> the middle east is in turmoil, israelis and palestinians bear fresh wounds from the recent conflict in gaza. Iran continues to play games with the world regarding its nuclear ambitions. And the arab spring continues to reverberate. In some good ways, for sure, but also in some troubling ways. And the civil war in syria becomes a bigger humanitarian crisis by the day. That's a lot of problems in just one region. Here to give us his stake is jimmy carters national security adviser. What should president obama do with syria, as it continues its slow motion drift intochaos? 
>> I don't know, and I'm not being evasive. I literally don't know. We have to have better intelligence. Who's really fighting? Who started the fight. How was it financed. Where did the initial weaponry for the beginning of that struggle a year ago or so originate? There doesn't seem to be any clarity on it, second, what are the objectives of those who are doing the fighting? For example, the suicide bombing in damascus, is that the work of the more democratic groups that we would like to see in charge? Doesn't that smack of certain forms of extremist terror that's associated with extremist groups? 
>> Would you intervene militarily? 
>> Well, I would intervene militarily, if I knew that something has to be desperately prevented. Or if I knew that the effort would not produce a regional war and would produce a desirable political outcome. At this stage, I don't see much evidence for a yes as the answer to either proposition. 
>> James baker served as secretary of state for george bush, sr. 
>> The president is going to face unexpected challenges, but there's one challenge we know he's going to face. Which is what to do about iran. How would you advice him to deal with it in the second term? 

[00:35:49]


>> In my view, we cannot let iran become a nuclear power. Not because of the threat to israel or the threat to the united states or the threat to our modern arab allies in the gulf, but because of the proliferation effect of that. Everybody in the region will want their own weapon and they'll have the means to get it. 
>> You know what a decision like that would do to the presidency. If there were major military action and iran is a big country. Many times larger than iraq. It could derail almost all the other issues. 
>> When I say do what you have to do, it doesn't necessarily mean you're g to put boots on the groiran which i think would be a big mistake. I'm talking about eliminating their program through surgical strikes and that sort of thing. We have technologies now that the israelis don't have that could be effective to do that. 
>> He sees the dangers regarding iran quite differently. 
>> Get off the argument, old options are on the table. What does that mean? We're going to commit suicide as one of those options? Art a war? That doesn't make any sense to me as a matter of national policy, and I don't think the country would support it. I don't buy the irrational argument that the iranians are so suicidal, the country of 75 million people or 80 million people are going to rush into committing suicide the moment it gets the first prototype of its bomb. Now, that even ignores the scientific fact that bombs have to be tested. You have to have a number of them to be credible, et cetera, et cetera. We're not dealing with an imminent threat, a reaction to which should be decided by someone else drawing red lines for us pp. 
>> A red line should be drawn right here. 
>> What do you think going-forward the president's strategy on iran should be? 
>> I think a war and the region will be a total disaster for the region, which will be aflame, it would make ou thdraw from afghanistan much more difficult. The war would spread to iraq, to lebanon and to jordan, very predictably. The price of oil has skyrocketed. These are calamities for us, and we'll be stuck for another decade. I think that has to be avoids even if negotiations don't succeed. We have an incredible safeway of responding. Namely, to make it absolutely clear that threat from them derived from their acquisition of nuclear capability will be viewed by the united states as an assault on the united states if it is directed by our friends in the middle east and in particular israel. I think that would contain and deter the iranians. 

[00:38:52]


>> How would you handle israel with regard to the iran issue. 
>> I would tell israel the same thing that the obama administration has already told israel. It's not in your interest to bomb nuclear facilities. It's not in our national interest. You let us take care of that. We have the potential to stop it, have you the potential only to delay it. And the consequences of your doing it are right now incomprehensible. They could be very, very dire. 
>> Do you believe that it's important that in president obama's second term, he try to make a renewed effort on the middle east peace process? Even though, let's face it, so far, what he's done has been unsuccessful? 
>> I'll tell you why I think so. I think if we don't move and do what is necessary, the arab masses will become more radicalized, more religiously driven and more jihadist, vis-a-vis israel, and I don't think israel can survive in the long run in that context. 
>> Handling iran will be a delicate balance between toughness and restraint. Unlike other foreign policy crisis, the clock is ticking.

>>> The most important relationship in the world right now is the one between the united states and china. The world's number one and number two economies. Successful management of this relationship will be one of president obama's most important tasks over the next four years, it's a mission fraught with potential pitfalls as the two powers compete economically, and militarily as well. A little over a year ago, president obama signalled a pivot to asia. 

[00:45:56]


>> We are here to stay. 
>> How is it working? Jimmy carter's national security adviser hed broaden the relationship with china. You say it's a challenge and opportunity the shift of power to asia? 
>> That's correct. I think our policy historically has been europe focused. Today the center of political gravity has shifted from europe to asia. In these that both are now important. We ought to think of role in asia. Not in the fashion that because of two world wars we were compelled to think of it in europe, but more in the fashion that is similar to british rule in europe in the 19th century. Britain was not a protagonist but a balancer in europe. I think that's the model for us in asia. We should avoid getting involved in mainland contests. For example, when they offered us a use of cameron we're not acting on the charity, they're obviously trying to get us to cam ranh bay so our navy would be in an assertive political support for them against the chinese. 
>> The danger is involvement, which is not of deceasive importance. 
>> I think what is important to us we be a balancer so we discourage dramatic shifts or particular use of force. 
>> James baker served as! Secretary of state under george bush, senior. 
>> There are a lot of countries in asia that are looking at china's rise with apprehension. They have asked the united states to get more involved, singapore, philippines, vietnam, japan, most importantly australia. How should we think about this pivot? 
>> We're wise to stay out of the disputes in the south china sea. See if we can get the parties to resolve those disputes peacefully. If those disputes end up cfree navigation, that's different, we would be impacted directly. We could ally with vietnam probably today, interestingly enough. Our long-time opponent would be an ally of ours against china, but I'm not sure that's the way to go. We will have to closely monitor china's military buildup. We plan to do that as i understand it, that's important to do, we must keep a robust military presence in the pacific. We do that with the seventh fleet, they have every bit as big an interest in getting along with us as we do in getting along with them. And where our interests don't converge, where we have differences, we stand up for our views, and we stand up for our rights. 

[00:48:59]


>> When youook at u.S. Relations with china, do you think we should be doing anything different going-forward? 
>> I think we should certainly reassert publicly the importance of the relationship. We should avoid the kind of language that was used in our presidential campaign. And particularly by the party that lost. 
>> Day one I will label china a currency manipulator, which will allow me as president to be able to put in place if necessary tariffs where believe they are taking unfair advantage of our manufacturers. 
>> It sent a message to the chinese, to which they started to reciprocate in kind with alarm and anger, that's the kind of stuff we need to avoid. 
>> President clinton's treasury secretary says china is often used as a whipping post during presidential campaigns. 
>> One thing I think I can say with absolute assurance, and i believe nothing is absolutely sure in life. If governor romney had been elected president he would not have declared china a currency manipulator on his first day. The presidential campaigns have a tendency to point at china. I think it is in our kmeks self-interest to have an effective relationship. A lot of what they complain about with respect to us, i think it would be in our interest to deal with. Similarly, a lot of what we complain about with respect to them. Their export driven strategy, i think it's critically important for their own self-interest if they're going to have sustainable growth going-forward to deal with that issue. We have a common self-interest in dealing with many of the issues that we complain to each other about. 
>> What should be the core elements of a u.S. China relationship going-forward. 
>> The core elements of the cooperative u.S. Chinese partnership is in many respects in the communication january 2011 by presidents obama and jintao of china. It sets a framework. A framework in which the word partnership is really given meaning, and framework for something unprecedented in the history of human affairs. Namely, when two major powers arise, they almost never collide. For the first time in history, america and china have an opportunity to avoid that, be partners and do themselves well, in the present circumstances worldwide, if china and america collide. If america and china collide, both will suffer. 

[00:51:48]


>> So the lesson is, to be careful not to drift into a hostile relationship with china.

>>> We've heard from senior states men and women on what president obama needs to do to have a successful second term. And a successful legacy. Here are some of my own thoughts. Most presidents get just a couple lines in history. 
>> We face our common difficulties. 
>> Fdr revived the country after the great depression and won world war ii. 
>> This purpose is not to punish. 
>> Lyndon johnson created the great society and escalated the war in vietnam. The first line of president obama's legacy has already been written he helped usher in universal health care in america. That is an historic achievement, but it remains to be seen whether it is the beginning of a path toward a more humane and sustainable health care system or one more step down a path of fiscal ruin. Having expanded access to health care in his first term, obama must now concentrate on bringing costs down, using some of the mechanisms within obama care, but expanding them and creating others. Getting health care reform right will be more important to our fiscal future than any other set of policies. Beyond this, obama has opportunities to make large moves. He could and shouldackle immigration because it does seem right for resolution. He might even be able to find common ground on reforming the tax code, something most americans agree needs to be reformed. But none of these efforts will rise to the level of that second line for obama's legacy. 
>> Good afternoon, everybody. 
>> That will depend on the future of american growth. The president inherited an economy in free fall. He helped prevent a second great depression. But he also inherited an economy that was fundamentally unbalanced. For over 20 years, economic growth in america has been slow. Recoveries have been jobless, and median wages have declined. We need a new strategy for growth. 

[00:58:22]


>> Based on reform and investment we need major reforms of regulations and tax policies to make america competitive and growth oriented. But we also desperately need new investments for the future. We need a world class infrastructure, not one that is now ranked 25th in the world according to the world economic forum. We need highly trained workers. We need to rebuild our great universities to be centers of access and excellence so that every american has a path to success. IN THE 1950s AND 60s, AMERICA Spnt 5% of its gdp on investments for the future, today that number is 3%. And it's likely to fall in the years ahead as entitlement spending crowds out everything else many we now spend $4 for every american over 65 compared with $1 for every american under 18. We are demonstrating vividly our preference for consumption over investment for the present over the future and for our own interests over those of our children. If president obama can change this trend he will probably not get much applause today. But he will restore the american economy, secure america's place in the world and his own place in history. Thank you for watching memo to the president. If you have an idea for the

do you ever pretend that your hand is flying? You could use both hands. I have flying on my mind today because you and I have been invited to visit 

[00:02:02]


the flying karamazov brothers. I don't think they fly, but they make a lot of other things fly. They're rehearsing at a neighborhood theater and they said we could come, so let's just go there now and see what the flying karamazov brothers really do. Here we are at the theater. Let's just go on in. Fred, you made it. I'm so glad. Please, come on up. Thanks, sam. Wow, you all are fabulous. Thanks a lot. Fred rogers, this is howard patterson. Paul magid. And michael preston. Glad to meet you. Now, I'd like you all to meet my television neighbors. The flying karamazov brothers. All: Hi. You were passing those... What do you call these? We call them pins. You were passing them and moving the whole time. Could I touch one? Oh, please, hold one. This is quite light. It weighs about half a pound. So it's not the same kind you would have in a bowling alley? No, no, bowling pins weigh much more. 

[00:04:03]


But you go like that... Wow, very good. I love to see you do those things. Somebody told me that you play music with these as well. Yes, we have some mallets we play music with. Would you like to see those? I would, yes, thank you. Shall I take that? This looks something like a xylophone. It's actually a marimbaphone. Marimbaphone? Would you like to try it? Sure. That's one of our mallets. ( playing random notes) But what does this have to do with juggling? Well, these are special mallets that we juggle and play the marimba at the same time. Would you do that? Sure, our favorite piece to play is bach's "two-part invention number four in d minor." We'll play part of it. ( playing Bach's "Invention No. Four in D Minor") Isn't that wonderful? Incredible. Oh, thank you for that. Are you both musicians? Uh-huh, ye, I play clarinet and reed instruments. I started playing trombone when I was eight years old. 

[00:06:06]


Rogers: So you're just full of music. Yeah, we were musicians before we started to juggle, anyway. You, too. All of us were. We all were. So you really are full of rhythm to be able to do this. Juggling is a very rhythmic thing, and music is also so they blend together well. But when you started to juggle you didn't use mallets or pins like you use now. No, I started with walnuts. Walnuts? Yeah-- I had a lot of them around. And I started doing two in one hand. Just figured it out myself and then a friend told me how to do three. But you dropped some, didn't you? All the time. Got to drop. Oh, glad to hear that because every time I try to do any kind of juggling it goes right on the floor. You need a lesson or something. I sure do need a lesson. May I offer you one? Certainly. Right here are some scarves which people learn to juggle with. We'll start with one. With just a single scarf just toss it back and forth from hand to hand. And then with the second scarf... That's not hard. You exchange. You toss one-- when it starts to come down you throw a second one, like this. Oh-oh. One, two, catch, catch. It's a little bit harder but it's not too bad. Scarves are a nice thing to learn with. They don't bounce around the house and they also fall slowly. Very good. It needs to be musical, doesn't it? Very rhythmic is the essence of it. 

[00:08:06]


Juggling is just left, right, left, right, left, right. It's just as simple as that. And when you want to do three you start with the hand that holds two and you throw one and when the second one starts to come down you throw the third one. So here, have a third one and give it shot. Start with the hand that holds two. Down they go. I spent many years perfecting the drop trick actually in my early juggling days. Throw first one of those and then this one and then the red one. Very good. That's exactly it. And really, don't worry about dropping. Just make sure you do those throws: Left, right, left, right. One, two, three, very good. Very, very good-- congratulations. I'll have to try these when I'm by myself. Please do keep the set. You've earned your juggling scarves. Sam, go get your shoes on. It looks like you all have different shoes on. We have some taps on our shoes so we can make music with our feet. And we also have things on our hands. What are these? We call the gloves "wackos." They're like tap gloves. There are little snaps on the palms and when we catch a club they make a sound. Show us how you do that. ( tapping) Like that. How was the lesson? Oh, it was fine. You know, sam's a fine teacher. You're going to tap dance as you juggle? Yeah, we're going to tap dance and make sounds with our hands all at once. You'll be able to see better from out there. Thanks. 

[00:10:08]


( rhythmic tapping) Everybody mambo. All: Yo! You are just great. No wonder people call you the flying karamazov brothers. I'm proud to be your neighbor. Bye-bye. ( all saying good-bye) Let's try it again, guys. Let's just go on back to my place. When people juggle well they make it look as if the things they're juggling are really flying in the air. Let's have some make-believe. ( trolley bell dinging) Those flying karamazov brothers are wonderful. 

[00:12:10]


Trolley, I wondered if you ever thought of flying. ( trolley whistles) Like x the owl, yeah. All right, let's just have some make-believe. To the neighborhood of make-believe. Oh, hello, trolley. Oh, neighbor aber, you all are so generous. Mayor maggie thought these might be of help. Oh, food for the world can always use food. And some money to send it where it's needed. Thank mayor maggie for us won't you? I'll be glad to. I'll just leave this produce here. That'll be just fine and I thank you again, neighbor aber. You're welcome. Oh, such generosity. ( whistling Mister Rogers' theme) ( tapping) Do you hear some strange noises? Let's see if it gets louder or softer as we go this way. Hmm, I can hardly hear it over here so it must be back there somewhere. ( tapping, clanging) It's getting louder, so we must be closer. Wow, it sounds like it's in ther x the owl, are you all right? Oh, neighbor aber, I was just hoping somebody wouldome by. Hi, x, are you okay? Oh, yeah, I'm okay, but I can't get my owl copy machine to work. Your owl copy machine? I was trying to print up some flyers and all of a sudden, it stuck. Where is your machine? Inside my tree. 

[00:14:10]


Do you have time to help with it? Do you want to show it to me? Why don't you just come on inside? Back door? That's the easiest way. I'll see you inside in one and a half. One and a half it is. ( knock at door) Yeah, come on in. Yeah. Hey, x. It's right over here. Oh, my, it does look like there's something wrong. That's my copy machine. What is this you're trying to print? Yeah, I'm trying to print "learn to fly." Oh, I see, "learn to fly." You planning to give flying lessons, x? Sure, I mean if I can fly I should certainly be able to teach somebody. I don't know about that. But I came to fix your machine. Yep, do you think you can do it? Well, I'm not sure. Is it unplugged? I'll check for sure. Okay. Yep, it's unplugged. Okay, good. Well, let's see. Well, that seems to be all right. Everything looks good out here. Let's take a look inside. Well, the rollers... Oh, wait a minute. What? Has this blue, yellow and pink scarf always been in here? I wondered where that was. You mind if I take it out? Oh, please do. ( chuckles) There. Well, well, well. Thanks, neighbor aber. You're welcome. 

[00:16:11]


Yeah, I better plug it in. We'll see if it works, okay? Okay. Just a second. All right. There it is. Oh, wow! Wow. It works. Thanks, I mean you're really good at fixing stuff. I'm glad I could help. I better turn it off now. Okay. That's much better. "Learn to fly." That's right. I'll tell you I'm going to teach flying. Please take some of those papers and give them to folks, all right? All right... Folks? Not just birds? I'll teach anybody to fly. Okay, I'll spread the word. You have plenty of flyers. About flying. ( both laugh) Thanks, neighbor aber. You're welcome, x. Do you want that scarf to remind you what a good fixer you are? Well, I'd be glad to have it. Thanks, see you later. Any time, and free flying lessons for you. Oh, no thanks, x. Walking is fine for me. You're our flyer. Okay then, see you later. Happy landing. Yeah. I think I'll make a few me. Very good, yeah. Meow in my tree meow x the owl. Oh, here he comes now. Oh. Hi, mayor maggie, hi, henrietta. You were inside. Yes, helping x with some flying flyers. Meow, meow, flyers? Learn to fly. X is goi to teach flying. Meow little birds? No, he'll teach anybody. Meow never meow meow. What would you want to learn to do, hen? Meow like meow two. Sing like mayor maggie and i? That's very nice. Meow, meow, sing meow something? 

[00:18:12]


Of course. Certainly. What song for henrietta? How about "you are special"? How about that, hen? Meow meow special, meow perfect. 
Both: ?????? You are my friend, you are special       you are my friend, you're special to me       you are the only one like you, like you, my friend       I like you.       meow meow daytime       meow meow nighttime       anytime that you feel's the right time       for a friendship with me, you see       f-r-i-e-n-d special       you are my friend       you're special to me    Both:    There's only one in this wonderful world    All:    Meow meow...

Mm-hmm. Meow bye. Good-bye. Bye for now, hen. Did you deliver the food to queen sara? I did, the food and the money. She was very pleased and grateful. Good, I have a meeting with king friday. You'll take care of things in westwood? Sure, want some flyers? "Learn to fly." I wonder who will try. I'll walk. See you. Good meeting! Thanks, bye. ( trolley bell dings) Hi, trolley. ( dinging) Want to learn to fly, trolley? ( dinging) Well, x the owl is the teacher. ( dings) Hope you do, too, trolley. ( dinging) 

[00:20:13]


( trolley bell dinging) Do you think x the owl will be able to teach people... And trolleys and other things to fly? Of course, anything is possible in make-believe, isn't it? Make-believe is like a daydream, dreaming in the daytime. And anything can happen in dreaming. 
?????? In the daytime, in the nighttime     anytime that you feel's the right time       for a friendship with me, you see       f-r-i-e-n-d special       you are my friend, u're special to me       there's only one in this wonderful world       you are special.     ??????
( knocking) Well, I wonder what special person is at our door. Let's see. OH, IT'S MR. McFEELY. COME IN, MR. McFEELY. Speedy delivery. I don't think I ordered anything. A long time ago you for a video about how people make a certain food in a factory. What kind of food? I'll give you a hint. Some people mix tomato sauce with this food. Is it pasta? It's pasta, in fact it's macaroni. This video is how people make macaroni. Do you have time to watch it? I do, I do. Let's show it on picture-picture. THANK YOU, MR. McFEELY. I thought you'd find it interesting. A long time ago... It finally came in. Great,e'll show it on picture-picture. How people make macaroni in a factory. 

[00:22:13]


McFeely: When people make macaroni, they use wheat. It's brought to the factory in trains like this. Rogers: That train's full of wheat? It is, and she's going to unload it from the bottom of the train. Bottom? Just watch, you'll see. It goes into bins under the ground. There it goes. Look at all that wheat. It really comes out fast. It surely does. Then it travels on a conveyor belt then in a bucket elevator to these tall buildings called silos. They're big, those silos. And from the silos it moves down through these big, blue pipes to the separator. It shakes out sticks and grass and dirt that might still be in with the wheat. I see what you mean. You wouldn't want that stuff in your wheat. No sirree. And here's the cleaned wheat. Ah, that does look clean. These e roller mills. They grind wheat into flour so that it's smooth, almost like sand. Roller mills, you call them? That's right. Uh-huh. OH, MR. McFEELY, WHAT ARE THOSE? I like the way they move. They're sifters. They shake out any leftover big pieces so just the smooth flour is left for the macaroni. Sifters, huh? Sifters. This big mixing machine mixes water with the flour to make the macaroni dough. She's adding the water now. I see it going through the tube. 

[00:24:15]


And there's the flour ready to be stirred up by those mixing blades. She starts the machine... And there it goes... Round and round. Mm-hmm. Now, here comes my favorite part. Your favorite part? Yes, that's the extruder. Extruder? Now, watch carefully and you'll see the macaronis coming out of the machine. Any wonder it's your favorite part. That is fun to watch. Cutting each one of those macaronis. That's right. Why is he squeezing that dough? Well, he's checking to be sure it's just right. The macaroni moves through these long tubes where it is dried. Dried? Not cooked, but dried? No, just dried. That conveyor shakes out all the broken pieces. Look at all that macaroni. Looks like it's dancing. That's enough to feed a lot of people. I should say. And down it goes into this machine where it's weighed so that each box of macaroni has just the right amount inside. And now it goes into the box. That part of the machine reminds me of a merry-go-round. Me, too. And now it's sent to stores where people can buy it, eat it and enjoy it. I never realized how much work it is. Mostly we eat it and don't think about it. 

[00:26:15]


That's right. Macaroni and cheese is my grandchildren's favorite meal. I like it, don't you? I do, I'll show them this video, too. They might want to see it. I have more deliveries so speedy delivery to you. THANKS, MR. McFEELY, AND TO YOU. See you around. Thanks for remembering. You're welcome, bye-bye. Bye. MR. McFEELY REMEMBERS SO MUCH. I have to keep practicing, you know... It's fun to think about flying, isn't it? In fact, it's fun to pretend about all sorts of things like being stronger than we really are or being braver than we really are. But the best thing is to know that we're really just fine the way we're growing-- that people can like us exactly for what we really are way down deep inside ourselves. And knowing that for sure can give us all a good feeling. 
?????? It's such a good feeling to know you're alive       it's such a happy feeling you're growing inside       and when you wake up ready to say       I think I'll make a snappy new day       it's such a good feeling, a very good feeling       the feeling you know       that I'll be back when the day is new       and I'll have more ideas for you       and you'll have things you'll want to talk about       I will, too.     ??????
be back next time.

And let me tell you, some great stuff on here. The big hits, the album cuts, the forgotten 45s, All those great motown favorites, things that should have been bigger hits, things that are hits in our personal heart. I'm talking about songs like "the best things in life are free," "money" and barrett strong, the mighty miracles and "shop around," of course, "deliver the letter, the sooner the better"-- "mr. Postman." How about mary wells, that calypso beat? And "the one who really loves you," the contours with their gyration in "do you love me?" Continue with the mary wells sound and "two lovers," the miracles, "don't like you but I love you, seems that I'm always thinking of you, though you treat me badly, I love you madly, you've really got a hold on me." Incredible! Now, these are all the best sources we could find-- mostly stereo. 132 tracks on here. Incredible clarity when you hear things like "beechwood 4-5789," the marvelettes, and one of the records I just love by these ladies, "too strong to be strung along." It's so great. Marvin gaye doing the "hitch hike," "fingertips." Everybody say "yeah" for motown on pbs. The mighty miracles doing "micky's monkey," "whenever you're with her, something inside..." That's, of course, martha and the vandellas, "heat wave." And "quicksand." Great song by the miracles-- "gather 'round, swingers and friends, help me forget my hurt within." Of course, "i've gotta dance to keep from crying." "The girl's alright with me," the tempting temptations. Love that with eddie on lead, a little "contract on love," stevie wonder. This is just the first disc we're talking about. How about eddie holland and "leaving here"? What a great dance sound. These are all motown classic songs that we heard on the radio, songs that, when you got the 45, you always flipped it over, classic album tracks, classic cuts that will come your way when you call right now, or at the $150 level, you can choose the 3 dvd set, great motown, the complete show we're watching tonight, PLUS 2 EXTRA DVDs. YOU'RE GONNA LOVE THAT. Put that all together--$250-- incredible motown history, yours by supporting my music on pbs. Don't wait. We're waiting for you, the way you do the things you do. Well, pick up the phone. Do it right now. Call pbs. 

[00:24:08]


Denise: Well, if you're a music lover like me, a generous pledge to this network is an investment in your music knowledge and enjoyment. Public television is constantly challenged by growing costs and resource cut-backs, and that's why this network needs your financial support now more than ever before. The dollars you donate will preserve the treasury of our musical heritage. So please, call the number on your screen now with your pledge of support at any level that makes you feel comfortable. 
Smokey Robinson: The impact of motown around the world is so incredible to me, because when we started out-- and berry and I talk about this all the time. On the day that he started motown, he sat us down-- there were five people there. And he sat us down and he said, "you know, I'm going to start this record company and we're going to make great music. We're going to make music for everybody. We're not just going to make black music. We're going to make music for everybody and we're gonna make music with some great beats and some great stories and we're always going to make quality music." This is what he said, you know. And he and I talk about it... In his wildest dreams, or any of our wildest dreams who were sitting there at that moment, we had no idea what it was going to become. We had no idea. 
Tj: Pbs fosters great ideas for our children's learning, history, education, balanced news, great dramas, science, and the arts. Your contribution to the station at $150 helps support that mission, and we've got a great way to say thanks with a pbs exclusive 6 cd set. 
And this all-new "motown: Big hits and more" collection will come your way when you make your pledge by calling the number on the screen or joining on-line right now. ?????? It's a good, good feeling ?????? ?????? it's a good, good feeling, don't you know now? ?????? ?????? oh, but if you feel like loving me ?????? ?????? if you've got the notion ?????? ?????? I second that emotion ?????? ?????? don't you know I was made to love her? ?????? ?????? built my world all around her ?????? ?????? yeah, hey, hey, hey ?????? ?????? 'cause, baby, there ain't no mountain high enough ?????? ?????? ain't no valley low enough ?????? ?????? ain't no river wide enough ?????? ?????? to keep me from getting to you, baby ?????? ?????? oooh, that feeling, feeling ?????? ?????? got me rockin' and a reelin' ?????? ?????? ooh, I'm crazy 'bout your love, buttercup ?????? ?????? your kind of love, can't get enough ?????? ?????? ain't too proud to beg and you know it ?????? ?????? please don't leave me, girl, don't you go ?????? 

[00:26:45]


tj: So, please, call pbs right now with your pledge. "Motown: Big hits and more." I'm sure you've heard the question, why do we need public television with so many cable channels available and even more on the way? Public television will remain the one place on your dial committed to public service. That means service to you, the viewer. Throughout its history, pbs has consistently demonstrated this commitment through a wide variety of quality programs for you and your family. There's no one else finding and bringing back so many of our favorite motown groups-- many that have been retired for years, but that still have so much to contribute. Let their music play on. And that happens every time you call and give whatever you can to this station with your pledge. 
Tj: Who could believe we are in a world where you can't walk to your favorite record store on the corner and buy your favorite motown, tambla or soul 45? Well, the neighborhood here on pbs allows us to keep that tradition, keep that heritage proudly presented, preserved. We look at that and we say, "wow! Pbs." The culture, the history, the education. As we're presenting the history of motown records, a dream that started from one little house in detroit, michigan, and so many great songs that came from this dream that affected our lives, whether it was "please, mr. Postman" from the marvelettes, or "you've really got a hold on me" from the miracles, come and get these memories. Martha and the vandellas, one of their great sounds-- "here's your old teddy bear, here's your old friendship ring." Well, dial that number. It may not be "beechwood 4-5789," but dial that number right now on your screen and allow the future to stay strong here on pbs. How 'bout "shake me, wake me when it's over," the four tops? "Quicksand," martha reeves and the vandellas, is on here, great tun like "since I lost my baby" with the tempting temptations, "going to a go go, na-na-na-na, yeah, yeah" from the miracles, "the girl's alright with me," an early stevie wonder classic called "contract on love," "my guy" from mary wells, "i like it like that" from the miracles. Great tune-- ?????? that's where it's at, that's where it's at ?????? pbs is where it's at, and we like it like that. So please, baby, we need your lovin' right now. Pick up your phone and support your pbs station. 150--you will find this nowhere else. An exclusive 6 cd set made only for members of pbs. The comeback member, rejoin if you've given in the past. We need your help. We need your annual support right now. We're asking you to pick up the phone, join us one more time so we can keep all these great sounds playing. ?????? Nowhere to run to, baby ?????? ?????? nowhere to hide ?????? ?????? everybody say yeah! ?????? in 1963, a young black prodigy named stevland morris made his mark and changed music forever-- the true genius of little stevie wonder. ?????? ?????? ?????? baby ?????? ?????? everything is all right ?????? ?????? uptight ?????? ?????? out of sight ?????? ?????? baby ?????? ?????? everything is all right ?????? ?????? uptight ?????? ?????? out of sight ?????? ???

tj: That's the four tops move. See that? Right? That's because they'll tell you they weren't great dancers, but they were incredible singers when they started out as the four aims. Welcome to our motown celebration tonight here on pbs. I'm tj lubinsky, denise richardson, and we're trying to get together with that cholly atkins choreography and just have some fun. 
Denise: I thought we were doing pretty good, actually. 
Tj: I think of those songs, seeing levi and the guys with the great wonderful performance of "baby I need your lovin'," the big break-out song for them, marvin gaye's version of "i heard it through the grapevine," and what could be more inspirational, uplifting than "ain't no mountain high enough" or seeing little stevie wonder doing "uptight"? This is the best music, and we're asking you right now, if you appreciate what's going on, what's happening here on television tonight, experiencing these great moments again on pbs, go to your phone, make your pledge of support right now. 150--we've got something fantastic. We've put together a brand-new 6 cd set. This includes many extended versions, stereo...The best stereo sources we could find, and we actually ended up even mixing some special versions that you'll find unique to this collection. It's only available on pbs. 150 when you call right now. 6 CDs. Wait till you hear the version of "don't mess with bill," that great marvelettes song by, of course, william smokey robinson. Incredible stuff. "The hunter gets captured by the game," another lyric that only smoky could bring us. It's just incredible when you see this stuff. We're asking you, ck up your phone. Great cd set, you're gonna love this. We also have a dvd collection for you. You can choose that with great original performances. That is $150, or $250-- we'll put it all together. Ultimately, we need you to support the culture, the heritage, the history, and the breakthrough sound that, of course, is motown. 
Denise: And we don't just bring you motown, folks. Through great performances, we bring you andre rieu and we bring you tony bennett, and for your kids, we have curious george, and we have, yes, big bird. 
Tj: So what we're asking you to do rit is take one simple action: Pick up the phone wherever you are and say "man, this is my music. I love motown!" Call us and make your pledge. 

[00:49:39]


Denise: Now. ?????? 'Cause there's something about you, baby ?????? ?????? that makes me keep lovin' you ?????? 
tj: There's something about motown and something about pbs. Where else can you find great quality music, except for right here on public television? Consider the $150 pledge level, and we'll say thanks with an all-new exclusive 6 cd set 
of "motown: Big hits and more." ?????? I'll be there ?????? ?????? with a love that will see you through ?????? ?????? ain't that peculiar, baby? ?????? ?????? peculiar as can be ?????? ?????? oh ?????? ?????? well, I'll be doggone if I wouldn't work all day ?????? ?????? baby ?????? ?????? ooh, this old heart of mine been broke a thousand times ?????? ?????? each time you break away I think you're gone to stay ?????? ?????? reflections of the way life used to be ?????? ?????? reflections of the love you took from me ?????? ?????? if you can want, you can need ?????? ?????? and if you can need, you can care ?????? ?????? if you can care, you can love ?????? ?????? so when you want me, I'll be there ?????? ?????? whenever you want me, I'll be there ?????? ?????? bernadette, people are searching for ?????? ?????? the kind of love that we possessed ?????? ?????? oh, jimmy mack, you better hurry back ?????? ?????? need your loving ?????? ?????? jimmy mack ?????? ?????? so get ready, so get ready ?????? ?????? I'm gonna try to make you love me, too ?????? ?????? so get ready, so get ready, 'cause here I come ?????? ?????? get ready 'cause here I come, I'm on my way ?????? 
tj : And it's on your way when you make your contribution to pbs right now. 150 and the my music motown 6 cd set is yours. It's so incredible to have the opportunity to go inside the motown vaults and bring you the best stereo sources we could on this entire collection. All but three songs are in real stereo, lots of special mixes on here, too, but when you hear songs like "i want a love I can see," one of the most requested tunes we've gotten over the years from the tempting temptations, "the way you do the things you do"--those are in stereo. Wonderful onth marvin gaye. And "in my lonely room." Forget candy and the kisses. No no, we're talking about the original with martha and the vandellas. Brenda, "every little bit hurts." And of course, "nothing you could say can tear me away from my guy." That's mary wells. Another sound that could be, to me, the follow-up record to "my guy" is kim weston, "looking for the right guy." Another smokey robinson composition. Great tune by the miracles, "call and shout" kinda thing with "i like it like that." Martha and the vandellas, "callin' out around the world," are you ready for the pbs motown beat? Yes. "Dancing in the street." "Baby, I need your lovin'" with the fabulous four tops, and, yes, the song I married my wife, three children to, down the aisle with the miracles and "would I love you," a radio classic as you've never heard it before. It is, to me, the best miracles song that ever was, anywhere. But let me tell you, it's incredible, "needle in a haystack"-- fun sound from the velvelettes. "Girl, girl, girl, why you wanna make me blue"? And speaking of girls, supremes, "ask any girl" wi those strings on there. Melancholy sounds like the four tops, "without the one you love," and you know, "the sun is shining, there's plenty of life, a new day dawning... Since I've lost my baby, it's not there." Yeah, what? David ruffin. That's what we're talking about. $150--6 CDs. Exclusive pbs collection. Mary wells, "you lost the sweetest boy that time, yes, you did." How about a dance sound by the spinners? One of their great records called "sweet thing." Supremes, "baby love," and of course, "my girl" with the tempting temptations. That is just cd 2. That will come your way when you pick up the phone, support the station right now. So many great motown sounds, so many great memories are here because of you and your support of pbs. So, please, dial that number right now on the screen and make sure motown stays strong in your town, right here on your hometown station, pbs. I'd like to talk to you for just a moment about our public broadcasting community and why being a member not only benefits pbs, but you and your family as well.

Duke Kakir: It is so amazing. It's hard to put it... It's hard to put that kind of dimension of living, coming from nothing, just coming from ten years of really struggling and rehearsing every day and g[ing across country to pick up a couple hundred dollars and then riding all the way back in a raggedy car, you know, and not having anything except what you all share among each other to having a lot of those things and being in the nation's eyes and across the world's eyes. It was such a wondrous experience that we had. I mean, we were probably the happiest... I mean, it was a dream come true right then, BACK IN THE '60s. The songs really helped sustain all that. People loved that music, they loved the song. Motown was a major part of most people's lives at that time, which I'm very glad of, and they've carried it right through their life, and they keep saying, "i want more. I want my songs. Give me my music. Come on, give it up." ?????? Ooh, that feeling, feeling ?????? ?????? got me rockin' and a reelin' ?????? ?????? ooh, I'm crazy 'bout your lottercup ?????? ?????? your kind of love, can't get enough ?????? if you're a music lover like me,

Announcer: Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome my music series host jerry butler and series creator t.J. Lubinsky. 
[Applause] and that is the music of the mighty miracles, tracks of my tears. My goodness, yes. And I'm telling you, that is one of the all-time great songs by one of the all-time great songwriters, and it just wipes me away. Well, you know what, jerry, you have been a part of all of our music specials here on pbs, and one of the greatest things we can do because of your support is bring back the respect of the artists that we love, and you know, I live for the miracles. They are my number one group of all time. 
Jerry: Well, I'm sorry you said that, because I think the impressions were pretty good myself. 
Tj: Well, they're pretty good, too. 
Jerry: Well, alright, then. Since it's your show, you can have the miracles tonight only. 
Tj: When we started... 
[Laughter] say amen to that. I'm so proud. When we started these great shows, jerry, we had a great opportunity, and that was to bring one of motown's greatest voices out of the shadows, and this of course is the great claudette robinson, who's heard on every one of their records. 
Jerry: Yes. 
Tj: Every one of their records, you hear her voice right there with smokey and bobby and pete and ronnie, but she really didn't perform too much on television. She had kind of retired from touring at that time. We were able to put claudette back together with bobby rodgers, the miracles, and right now, the mighty miracles! 
Jerry: And they've never looked any better! ?????? if you remember this, feel free to join in! It's your show! ?????? ?????? goin' to a go-go ?????? ?????? goin' to a go-go ?????? ?????? na-na-na-na, yeah-hey ?????? ?????? well, there's a brand new place I found-a ?????? ?????? where people go from miles around-a ?????? ?????? they come from everywhere ?????? ?????? and if you'll drop in there ?????? ?????? you might see anyone in town-a ?????? ?????? goin' to a go-go ?????? ?????? ooh, wee hee ?????? ?????? goin' to a go-go ?????? ?????? baby, come on, now ?????? ?????? don't you wanna go? ?????? ?????? yeah ?????? ?????? alright ?????? ?????? goin' to a go-go ?????? ?????? hoo-hoo-wee-eee ?????? ?????? goin' to a go-go ?????? ?????? baby, come on now ?????? ?????? it doesn't matter where you are-a ?????? ?????? a go-go can be found ?????? ?????? you'll see the people from your block ?????? ?????? and don't be shocked ?????? ?????? if you see your favorite star-a ?????? ?????? goin' to a go-go ?????? ?????? everybody ?????? ?????? goin' to a go-go ?????? ?????? oh, come on now-ow ?????? ?????? don't you wanna go? ?????? ?????? yeah! ?????? ?????? say one more time, yeah ?????? ?????? ?????? na-na-na-na-na yeah-hey ?????? ?????? hooooo ?????? ?????? tell me ?????? ?????? don't you wanna go? ?????? ?????? yeah! ?????? ?????? say one more time, yeah ?????? ??????

It is so fantastic we've got you with us and the mighty miracles ending this segment. So great we could see them early on-- smokey robinson, bobby rogers, pete moore, and of course the late ronny white, always in the background on these records. You heard the sweet voice of claudette robinson. And then to see the current line-up of the miracles, claudette coming out of retirement and bobby rogers, who we love so much. "Going to a go go." What a fun record, isn't it? 

[01:18:58]


Denise: Absolutely a fun record, but look at the audience and look at the way the audience connects not only with the music but seeing the performers that they've come to know and love. It is a miracle, so to speak, to have that opportunity. 
Tj: And then earlier in this segment, when you see some of the performances from, for example, jimmy ruffin, doing "what becomes of the brokenhearted." 
Denise: This is an opportunity you won't get every day. You can't run down to the store anymore to just buy... There are no record stores anymore. 
Tj: There's no record stores anymore. Can you imagine at? 
Denise: You cannot possibly turn on the radio and hear this music, and so we really... This is the place. This is the happening place for where you can see it and hear it and enjoy it and get a history lesson, because there's a real history lesson here that you all are sharing with us. 
Tj: So pick up your phone right now and join us. Become the latest member or renew your membership to pbs, and we will keep the music playing for you.

[01:25:49]


Denise: If you're enjoying "motown: Big hits and more," remember that it's the dollars raised during these pledge breaks that makes it possible. Well, that's because the dollars raised now will be used to pay for more my music specials. Pbs consistently brings you programs you won't see anywhere else. Your pledge protects an environment where alternative programming-- that's television really worth watching-- can survive and flourish. Keep this great programming going. Call now with your pledge of support. Motown really was-- and smokey's lyrics were amazing. "Tracks of my tears," "ooh, baby, baby," "my girl has gone." And then, on the upswing, "goin' to a go go," "mickey's monkey." You go with the temptations, man, "beauty is only skin deep," you go with "my girl." I mean, this was music that young people and young america today, at any age, can relate to. Holland, dozier, and holland, in my opinion, were the greatest writers for dance music. "Come see about me." The things they did for martha reeves and the vandellas, the things they did for the isley brothers and the supremes. Amazing! When you do anything by the supremes, you're gonna do a cha-cha. When you do a song called "leaving here" by eddie holland, you're gonna do a stomp. When you do a line dance to "goin' to a go go," you're going to do a line dance. You're going to do a line dance to "all I need" by the temptations. So that rhythm beat affects you, man, and you just move, you just dance. 
Tj: The greatest dance music around--motown. And it's yours in an all-new 6 cd "motown: Big hits and more" collection. For supporting pbs, we'll say thanks with all your favorite motown dance floor favorites. ?????? Callin' out around the world ?????? ?????? are you ready for a brand-new beat? ?????? ?????? summer's here and the time is right ?????? ?????? for dancing in the street ?????? ?????? nowhere to run to, baby ?????? ?????? nowhere to hide ?????? ?????? got nowhere to run to, baby ?????? ?????? nowhere to hide ?????? ?????? ooh, sugar pie, honeybunch ?????? ?????? you know that I love you ?????? ?????? I can't help myself ?????? ?????? I love you and nobody else ?????? ?????? all, all I need ?????? ?????? is just to hear you say you forgive me ?????? ?????? forgive me, baby ?????? ?????? keep on loving me ?????? ?????? you got to keep on loving me ?????? ?????? ooh ?????? ?????? it's a good, good feeling ?????? ?????? it's a good, good feeling ?????? ?????? don't you know now ?????? ?????? yes, it is ??????

[01:48:38]


tj: "Motown: Big hits and more" will come your way. Your wonderful one, marvin gaye, marvelous marvin on here. "Sugar pie, honeybunch, can't help myself." Love this! Can't help ourselves to the motown sound, and you--you make it all possible with your pledge. Any pledge matters here. The most important thing is that you pick up and you join this action. All of us that feel that same vibration for this music and feel that same beat, that same feel from the tambourine or the funky bass line... Whatever it is that drives you to motown, we share that feeling, that vibration, and where have we shared it? We've shared it here on pbs. So, please, allow us to share this feeling for future generations, and some pretty cool thank-you gifts will come your way. So, please, call us right now. From out of this little old two-story house in detroit, michigan, renamed, without a number, it said, "hitsville, u.S.A." All the hits are here, all the feelings, all the emotion, all the energy of something we called motown, hitsville, u.S.A. What is it? What was the discovery here? Well, berry gordy, jr. And his people around him discovered that music does not have to be specific to a racial group. No. Music is universal. If it's presented properly and it tells a story that you are aware of, your lives, it will reach every audience. 
Harvey Holiday: I interviewed smokey robinson once, and he told me--and I haven't heard this anywhere else-- in 1959, he and berry gordy were driving on a snowy day to get a pressing at the pressing plant outside detroit of a marv johnson record. It was one of the first artists they produced before motown. And that they skidded on the ice and the car turned over. And I said, "smokey, can you imagine that if in 1959 you and berry gordy had died?" There'd be no "my girl." Would there be the supremes, the temps? It just shows you how life could have been so different if, god forbid, that would have happened. The motown era is something that will never be duplicated. It was a once-in-a-lifetime thing. When you talk about the songwriters, when you talk about the musicians, the incredible voices of smokey robinson, martha and the vandellas, diana ross. Nobody could bake like marvin gaye, levi stubbs. You can argue all day who the best singer was, who was the best female singer-- martha reeves, diana ross, gladys horton from the marvelettes, who's a special favorite of mine who doesn't get the credit that she deserves. It just captured-- real music that is popular captures what's going on in the world at that time with the greatest singers and the greatest arrangers and the musicians, of course. Just top-notch. Every one was a million-dollar production. 

[01:51:18]


Tj: We've got some incredible liner notes that were written by bill dahl for this. ALSO, SURVEYS FROM SOME OF OUR FAVORITE DJs-- Cousin brucie and his favorite motown hits and should-have-been hits. And bobby jay. Love these guys who introduced to this motown sound. The geator with the heater. These were the sounds that the geator would play at all of his dance parties, and of course harvey holiday introduced me to this on his motown show. 7talk about classics here, one of the songs that the new york guys really love is "dance party" by martha and the vandellas. "Third finger, left hand," that's where you know how to place the wedding band. "Forever," marvin gaye's version. And love the marvelettes-- an incredible feeling. But you'll get that same feeling when you hear marvin do this. Absolutely awesome. "Impossible dream." Now, this is a timeless thought. You think of pbs and broadway, and you think about that song "the impossible dream" from "man of la mancha," of course. And now you hear david ruffin do it. There is one song I picked on here that had to be on here. It's a dance club classic. Chances are you may not have heard it before, but when you hear it, you'll want to hear it over and over and over again. That, of courslady by the name of frances nero and the song, "keep on loving me." When you hear, "it's easy to fall in love with a guy like you" and when you hear the vulnerability that is in martha's voice in this particular track, it's beautiful. It's gonna make you cry. Just like "what's so good about goodbye" with the miracles. You know, "if leaving causes grieving and to part can break your heart. Then tell me what's so good about it? I could have done without it. What's so good about goodbye?" "It's a good, good feeling"-- a great dance record, a line dance record from the miracles off their 1967 "make it happen" album. Love that as well. You're gonna love it, too, and it's a great feeling when you call your pbs station right now, make your pledge.150-- cd set will come your way, and all the great things pbs does for you, for your children, for your grandchildren, and your community.

>> Welcome. Just before the holidays, we asked you, our viewers, to recommend the one book you thought president obama should read as he prepares himself for his second term in office. As ever, your suggestions were thoughtful, provocative and eclectic -- from books by authors who have appeared as guests on this broadcast, to works by the late john steinbeck and a. A. Milne, the creator of winnie-the-pooh. You can see a list at our website, billmoyers.Com. Many of you asked for my choice, too. This is it, paul krugman's "end this depression now!" It's both prescription and warning. Our current obsession with slashing the deficit and avoiding that well-known and worn fiscal cliff is killing us, krugman writes, getting in the way of what really needs to be done, which is dedicating government to creating jobs and getting us back to full employment. He blames not only congress but the white house. Paul krugman is professor of economics and international affairs at princeton university. Since 1999, he's been an op-ed columnist at "the new york times" and now also writes a blog for the paper titled "the conscience of a liberal." According to the search engine technorati, it's the most popular blog by an individual on the internet. Author or editor of some 20 books and more than 200 professional papers, krugman is a thinker so esteemed and widely known in his field he's become an icon. Not only has he won the nobel prize in economics, he's also the subject of this song by the balladeer loudon wainwright iii -- ?????? I read the new york times that's where I get my news ?????? ?????? paul krugman's on the op-ed page that's where I get ?????? ?????? the blues 'cause paul always tells it like it is we get ?????? ?????? it blow by blow ?????? 

[00:03:32]


>> as if being immortalized by the blues isn't enough, there was even an unofficial campaign and petition in the last few days urging president obama to make paul krugman the next secretary of the treasury. It was an honor, as shakespeare would say, that mr. Krugman dreams not of. Paul krugman, welcome. 
>> Hi there. 
>> So, like william tecumseh sherman you refuse to be drafted. 
>> Well, you know, fortunately it hasn't come to that point. But I think I probably would. 
>> But you remember what general sherman said when there was a movement to run him for president, "i will not accept if nominated and will not serve if elected." That was the sherman like statement you issued. 
>> That's, well, I'm not quite up to sherman's standards and i don't think I'm quite ready to lay waste to georgia either. But a good, good man I admire actually. 
>> But the grassroots campaign in your behalf, unofficial, was serious. I mean, over 235,000 people signed on. You broke their hearts. Any regrets? 
>> No, because I probably have more influence than i, doing what I do now than I would if i were inside trying to, you know, do the court power games that come with any white house, even the best, which I don't think I'd be any good at. So no, this is fine. And what the president needs right now is he needs a hardnosed negotiator. And rumor has it that's what he's got, so. 
>> In jack lew? 
>> That's right. The president can't pass major new legislation. He can't formulate major new programs right now. What he has to do now is bargain down or ride over these crazy people in the republican party. And we what we need now is not deep thinking from the treasury secretary. If the president wants deep thinkers, he can call joe stiglitz, he can call other people. What he needs from the treasury secretary is somebody who's going to be very effective at dealing with these wild men and making sure that nothing terrible happens. 
>> I understand that jack lew has depression art on his, the wall of his office, art done by the works progress administration. Which would be a good sign for someone like you who believes the depression is back. 

[00:05:42]


>> That's, I have to say, the most reassuring thing I've heard about him. Wpa, you know, they produced a lot of art, which I think it's almost inconceivable now. But also the wpa was one of the really good moments in american policy. In a time of economic disaster, hiring people, giving them jobs to do things that are good, much of which survives and is an important part of our physical planet today. This is great. And the fact that he thinks well of and admires what the wpa did, that's a very hopeful sign. 
>> What could jack lew do as treasury secretary that would make you think he's a kindred spirit? 
>> Campaign against this austerity obsession. We're not going to get a big new stimulus package, much as i would like to see it. No, we're not going to get it this year, anyway. But I'd like to see him saying when somebody says, "well, we need to slash here, we need to slash there." And he would say "why would we want to be doing that now? That's actually going to hurt the economy." 
>> But hasn't our economy changed so much since franklin roosevelt simply put people on the government payroll? 
>> It's, economics, the underlying rules change a lot more slowly than people imagine. People look and they say, "oh, you know, back then they were taking ocean liners and now we fly jet airplanes." Or, "back then we didn't have a global economy." Actually, we did. It's a little bit fancier now. But the basic rules are not are not much changed. It takesdreds of years for those to change a whole lot. And this is, I can pretty easily assemble a bunch of headlines from the 1930s and they will sound like they're right out of today's headlines. This is the same kind of animal that we confronted in the '30s. This is depression economics. And the nature of the solution is not really very different now from what it was then. 
>> What do you mean, depression economics? 
>> Well, two things really. One is, a recession is when the economy's going down. A depression is when the economy is down. So, you know, the u.S. Economy was actually expanding through most of the 1930s, after a terrible big slump at the beginning and another slump later in the '30s. And then it was expanding in between. But we call that whole episode the great depression because it was all a period of high unemployment and a lot of suffering. And, of course, we're in that now. It's not as bad as the great depression. You know, it's a great recommendation. Not as bad as the great depression. It's terrible. We have a persistently depressed economy, persistent lack of jobs. So in that sense, it's a depression. And there's also a more technical meaning. Depression economics is when the normal things you do to boost the economy, have the federal reserve cut interest rates a little bit, are no longer available or effective. It's a situation where the normal rules of what you -- of economic policy, have to be put on hold, and you really need to do extraordinary stuff. 

[00:08:23]


>> Well, the fed has kept the interest late very low. And it has made a big difference, has it? 
>> I think it actually has. If they hadn't kept the interest rate low, things would be much, much worse. Meaning -- 
>> more people out to work. 
>> That's right. We, you know, this is not as bad as the great depression. Again, our famous last words. But part of the reason is that the fed did learn something from the 1930s. It's learned that raising interest rates to stabilize the price of gold is a really bad idea in times like this. But the trouble is that zero, which is as low as it can get, is not low enough. And we actually know pretty well what you need to do. 
>> The other side of it is that people have been told so long, "save money. Save money. Americans were not saving." Now if they save money, they make no money from their savings. 
>> That's right. And, actually the truth is right now saving hurts us. It's because what, another way, yet another way to think about depression economics, depression economics is a situation where the total amount that people want to save is less than the amount that businesses are willing to invest. You can think of that as being the result, a lot of it is because of this overhang of personal household debt from the past. We had a housing bubble that burst, leaving us with too much construction. We have a financial system that's disrupted. But all of that leads to the fact that there's, the amount that businesses are willing to invest is less than the amount that collectively we all want to save, including corporations that are trying to retain earnings. Which means that we're awash in excess savings. And if you decide to save more, it's not actually going to help society. I mean, things add up. If there's a crucial, one crucial thing to understand about all this it is that the global economy, money moves around in a circle. And my spending is your income, and your spending is my income. And if all of us try to spend less because we want to save more, we don't succeed. All we end up doing is creating a global depression. 
>> So your prescription in this book, and the book is an argument for the prescription, is that the government should spend more so that people can buy more. In other words, creating demand that will drive the economy. That's the chief argument in here. 

[00:10:29]


>> That's right. There are some other things you can do. Debt relief, where you can do it, will help because it will make people able to spend more. There're some things that the, maybe the federal reserve can do, even though interest rates are zero. But the core thing, the thing that we know works, the thing that all the evidence of history says works in a situation like this is the private sector won't spend, government can step in and provide the spending that we need in order to keep this economy afloat. 
>> As you know, there is an argument on the other side that says that roosevelt, in spending in the '30s, did not really bring us out of the depression. It was, and you acknowledge this in the book, the war, in which so much money was spent, you couldn't help but put people to work. 
>> That's right. But the fact that it was a war that finally got the u.S. Government to spend enough is not an argument against spending. It's an argument about politics. It's saying that then, as now, lots of people were saying, "oh, it would be irresponsible to spend," and it wasn't until something external came along that the political restraints were released. And then, we didn't, we actually were, we had recovered from the great depression before pearl harbor, because the u.S. Economy really went to war in 1940. And presto. I mean, lots of people said, "oh, spending more can't produce recovery." And then we started our military buildup because war had broken out in europe. And suddenly, we had recovery. I made it as a joke, but if we discovered a threat from space aliens and decided that to deal with that threat, we needed to actually, somehow or other we needed to do a lot of infrastructure spending. We needed to build roads and high-speedl. We would have full employment. 
>> By full employment, you mean? 
>> Something like 5% unemployment. 
>> There essentially will always be a certain number of people who are not working for one reason or another. 
>> Yeah. It's a dynamic economy. There's always going to be companies failing. There's always going to be people quitting a job and taking some time to find a new one. There's a lot of friction in the economy. So the fact of the matter is that normal, a normally pretty full employment economy is still going to have 5% measured unemployment. That's okay. But there's a world of difference between that and right now the official number is in the high sevens. But a lot of measures suggest it's a lot worse than that. I mean, and most important, we have 4 million who've been out of work for more than a year, which is unprecedented since the 1930s. 

[00:12:46]


>> Yeah, you write that we are in a depression that is essentially gratuitous. We don't need to be suffering so much pain and destroying so many lives. 
>> Gratuitous in the sense that there's nothing, the only obstacles to putting people to work, to having those lives restored, to producing hundreds of billions, probably 900 billion a year or so of extra valuable stuff in our economy, is in our minds. If I could somehow convince the members of congress and the usual suspects that deficit spending, for the time being, is okay, and that what we really need is a big job creation program. And let's worry about the deficit after we've had a solid recovery, it would all be over. It would be no problem at all, which is what, that's the lesson of 1940, 1941. 
>> Which is? 
>> You can find all kinds of people explaining what was fundamentally wrong with the u.S. Economy in 1940, that technology makes it impossible, workers don't have the right skill. Then along came a war in europe and we started spending. Actually, at that point, spending a lot on infrastructure because we were getting ready for a war. And all of a sudden -- 
>> building harbors, building all kinds of -- 
>> and camps, training camps, there are a lot -- 
>> training -- 
>> the first thing that happened actually was a lot of construction spending on the giant new camps that the army was going need. And all of a sudden, all of those unemployable workers turned out to be extremely productive, if you gave them a job. All of those, you know, total inability to get the economy moving turned out to be totally easy to get the economy moving. And we're basically in that situation right now. All the productive capacity is there. All that's lacking is the intellectual clarity and the political will. 
>> You make this so clear in the book, that's why I recommended that president obama read this book as the one book I would like to see him read before the inauguration next week. If he read it, what would you hope he would fasten on? 

[00:14:47]


>> I would hope that he would fasten on the notion, you know, he faces real political constraint. So we understand, he can't just pass legislation. But that the most important thing, his policy priority right now should be doing whatever he can to at least move in the direction of the kinds of policies that we want r full employment, that we need for full employment. And that the obsessions of washington about a grand bargain on the deficit are really pretty much beside the point right now. That, if given a choice between doing something that will help the economy in the next two years, and something that will allegedly settle our budget problems for all, you know, for all time, which is wouldn't, that he should go for the stuff that will help the economy now. That he should not bend on that point. 
>> I can imagine that if you were sitting across the table with him, he might reply, "look, krugman, we've got a recovery coming on. Jobs are being created more steadily than ever. Measured unemployment is falling. Households are shaking off their burden of debt. I can see light at the end of the tunnel. I don't think this is the time to do what you're saying." 
>> I think he might have said that two, three years ago. I don't think that president, you know, we happen to have a very intelligent man as president. He's for real. And he does understand. You can have real discussions with him. And I think he understands that, although things have improved some. We actually have had some progress on the economy in the past year. It's a glacial pace, compared with the way we should be. You can do this various ways. But if you think about the plunge that we took and you look at measures like the labor force, a fraction of prime age workers employed, whatever, we have maybe made up a quarterf the ground we lost in that great plunge in 2008, 2009. And it'll take years and years to get back to anything that looks like prosperity at this rate. 
>> What makes this a depression? You know, my generation remembers the photographs of those long lines of people looking for jobs, men and women both. Remembers the sad eyes, the hungry stomachs. Remembers that men were becoming so desperate they were becoming militant. But today, even though you say the situation, in terms of joblessness, is like the 1930s, you can't obviously, you can't transparently look around and see the evidence of a depression. 

[00:17:12]


>> That's right. It's, and partly that it's not as bad. So by modern concepts the great depression had unemployment rates that were as high as 20-something percent by modern measures. And even in 1937, when things had improved, before we went into the second leg of the great depression, it was still probably about a 9% unemployment rate by modern standards. And we've got a seven point something, 8%, whatever. So things are not as bad. But I think a lot of it is just that the optics have changed. 
>> Optics? 
>> The optic, the misery is there. I mean, is there anybody, i guess if you live in very rarified circles you don't know people who are desperate right now. But I live in pretty rarified circles and I do. I know, I have relatives, friends people I know who have, men my age who've lost jobs and see no prospect of getting another job and are just desperately trying to hang in there until they can collect their social surity and get on medicare. There are young people whose lives have collapsed. YOU KNOW, THEY GRADUqTE AND There's nothing there. 
>> Yeah, you make a very powerful point in here of the impact of being out of work now on the lifetime career of a young person who has no job at the moment. 
>> We have pretty good evidence on, you know, how long does it take to make up for the fact that you happen to graduate from college into a bad labor market. And the answer is forever. You will never recover. 
>> How so, what do you mean? 
>> You will never get, you'll miss years getting onto the career ladder. By the time you get a chance to get a job that makes any sense, you know, that makes any use of your skills, you will already be tarred as somebody, "well, you're 28-years-old and you haven't held a responsible position?" "Well, yeah, I couldn't because there were no jobs." It just shadows your whole life. And it's very clear in the evidence from past recessions, which have been nowhere near as bad as this one. The other thing I think I want to say here is that we have, in some ways, made things more civilized but also more invisible. Somebody said that food stamps are the soup kitchens of the modern depression. That there're a lot of people who would be standing in line to get that soup, who are instead, and it's a good thing, who are instead getting, I guess it's now called snap, supplementary nutritional assistance program, but who are getting those debit cards, and are getting essential food stuffs. And they're at the grocery store and they look like anybody else. But the fact of the matter is they are still as desperate, they're getting by day to day with the aid of a trickle of government aid, just like the people who were on, standing in line at the soup kitchens in the '30s, but they're not visible. They, we don't have guys selling apples in street corners partly because, you know, the city licensing wouldn't allow that anymore. But we do have, again, we've got four million people who've been out of work for more than a year. The u.S. Social system is not designed to take care of somebody who's been out of work. We have unemployment insurance that's intended to deal with short spells of unemployment. So there's an enormous amount of misery, but it is mostly hidden. 

[00:20:18]


>> So that's why you refer to it, even though the optics have changed, as a quote "vast, unnecessary catastrophe?" 
>> Yeah. The amount of damage that's being done is enormous. The amount of suffering of people is enormous. And if it isn't out there, visible on the streets, if it's dispersed across a suburban you know, if you see a house with a for sale sign that's been sitting there for a while, you may not know the story about the family that was driven from its house because they, one or both spouses lost jobs and couldn't find others. Or, and they were foreclosed on. But it's a real story, all the same. And there's lots of that going around. And none of this needs to be happening. 
>> And you argue that this could actually be solved in two years? 
>> That's right. And that's not a number plucked out of thin air. That's a guess at how long it would take to get a serious spending program going. And we could actually make a lot of difference in it even quicker than that because the fact of the matter is, far from having effective job creation program, we've actually been pulling back. We've seen state and local governments lay off hundreds of thousands of school teachers. We've seen public investment in basic stuff like road repair cut way back. If we just went back to normal rates of filling potholes and normal rates of employment of school teachers, that could be done in months. 
>> You wonder why, given the suffering, congress and the white house haven't acted. 
>> Well, there are I think two, two levels of opposition. And one of them is just raw politics. We have a powerful political movement in this country that has a longstanding goal of rolling back all of the social programs, all the safety net that we've created. They want smaller government. They want reduced public services. Even the idea of public schools is very much under attack. They want it all to be switched to a system of vouchers. And they see this, you and I see a disaster, they see an opportunity. Here we have cash strapped state and local government. Good. Forced to cut back in government. They don't want to do anything that will make it easier for them to, for government as we know it to continue. That movement controls one political party. And that political party controls one house of congress. And that is enough to stand in the way of a lot of things we ought to be doing. Then there's the second level, which is this odd coalescence of, I picked up the phrase from other people. Actually, from the blogger duncan black. "Very serious people," capital v, capital s, capital p. 

[00:23:06]


>> You're always writing that these very serious people. Who are they? 
>> Yeah. The notion that someone, well, you can look are your random set of, you know erskine bowles and alan simpson would be the quintessential very serious people. The editorial, practically the whole op-ed page, not all of them, but most of "the washington post." People for whom this, it's axiomatic that the budget deficit is the most important problem. And that what we really, really need to do right now at a time of mass unemployment is worry about the debt to gdp ratio ten years from now. And it's a very hard thing to crack, partly because it's not actually a rational argument. You very rarely, very rarely see on the sunday talk shows, people asking, "why exactly are you so concerned about the deficit right now?" That's sort of a given. That's a starting point. Everybody serious understands that, except that if you ask them why exactly, they can't give you a very good answer. 
>> What is the answer? 
>> It's partly that this is, it sounds serious. Never you know, never underestimate the importance of just plain what comes across. Start so it's partly just it sounds serious, it's the kind of thing that people who wear good suits are likely to talk about. Partly it is actually, of course, a deliberate pressure campaign. 
>> For example, pete peterson, nixon's secretary of the commerce, billionaire several times over haset up this "fix the debt" campaign and is said to be putting half a billion dollars into trying to influence the public. 
>> Yeah, actually it's not just "fix the debt," that's just the latest incarnation. There's also the committee for a responsible federal budget, there's the newspaper "the fiscal times," there's several others. It's a who portfolio. They all are peterson foundation money at the roots, but they're all out there. And yeah, serious attempts to influence public debate are not, by and large, a very lavishly funded enterprise. 

[00:25:17]


>> But in this case? 
>> But in this case, you've got so half a billion dollars, $500 million of spending with one agenda is going to have a huge impact. You know, policy intellectuals, by and large come cheap. A few hundred thousand in consulting contracts could do a lot there. 
>> Do you think some of them are serious about the debt leading to a loss of confidence on the part of investors in foreign governments? I mean, even three years ago barack obama expressed concern about the long term debt and the confidence of people in the u.S. Government. Take a listen. 
>> There may be some tax provisions that can encourage businesses to hire sooner rather than sitting on the sidelines. We're taking a look at those. I think it is important, though, to recognize that if we keep on adding to the debt, even in the midst of this recovery, that at some point, people could lose confidence in the us economy in a way that could actually lead to a double-dip recession. 
>> I remember that well. And at the time it was going on, I do occasionally find myself in meetings with very serious people myself. I guess I am personally one now and then. There was this widespread view among people, and not all of it venal, not all of it self-interested, that somehow things were hanging by a thread. That any day now we could have a run on u.S. Government debt, which was wrong. But, okay, I can see how people could for a while have believed that. But a lot of time has gone by since then. And I hope that at least some people have learned better. But it's amazing how little the continued failure of these warnings to actually be vindicated by anything has -- how ttle of that's actually affected the debate. And there's a special issue here, which I've actually tried to get across now, and I find that I get resistance even from people who are, I would've hoped were more flexible. It's even very hard to tell the story about how this loss of confidence is supposed to work. I mean, it's the united states is not like a european country that doesn't have its own currency. The u.S. Government cannot run out of cash unless congress prevents it, you know creates an entirely self-inflicted shortage through the debt ceiling. How is it exactly that we're supposed to have this crisis that leads to a double dip recession? It really doesn't even make sense as a story. And yet it is one of those things that people say and by and large, are not contradicted on. 

[00:28:00]


>> We keep hearing from the right that we're here on the path to becoming greece, and you say that that's impossible? 
>> Yeah. We, even if, suppose that people decided, investors decided they don't like u.S. Government debt, it can't cause a funding crisis because the u.S. Government prints money. It's even hard to see how it can drive up interest rates because the fed sets interest rates at the short end, and why exactly would the long run rates go up if you don't expect the fed to raise rates? It could lead to a weakening of the u.S. Dollar against other currencies. But that's actually a good thing. Ould make u.S. Exports more competitive. That would actually boost our economy. So it's, actually impossible to tell that story, as far as I can tell. And yet, it's not, again we're mostly not in the realm of rational discourse here. It's one of those things where people say it, they hear other people saying it. And they don't actually try to work it through. And it plays a big role, I'm sorry, in influencing our public discussion. Interestingly, people who actually have money on the line, that is people who are buying bonds, just keep on driving u.S. Interest rates ever lower. So actual investors don't care about this stuff. But our political class does. 
>> Why don't they care? 
>> Because first of all, because I think at some level investors understand what I'm saying. That it's very difficult to see any reason why the fed would raise short term rates, which is controls for years to come. And in that case, long term debt even at a pretty low interest rate is a reasonable investment. Hard to see how a financial crisis actually develops against the united states, u.S. Government, which is in this you know, has all the luxury of printing its own currency. And investments are always about compared to what, right? If you if you say, "well, the u.S. Is a dangerous place to invest," I don't think it is, but particularly where is the safe place that people are going to invest? You know, what is this other asset that they're going to buy? And it doesn't really exist. 

[00:30:04]


>> You say we're in a liquidity trap. I don't understand that. 
>> Basically, a liquidity trap is we're, back up for a second. How do we normally deal with a recession? How do we deal with a garden variety recession like the 2001 after the dot com bubble burst, or 1991? The answer is that basically the fed, the federal reserve goes out there and prints money. Or strictly speaking credits banks, you know, credit banks with that extra reserves and buys treasury bills. And that normally starts a chain of events where, okay, the banks have got extra reserves, they lend them out. They, that drives down interest rates, leads to a whole series of events, which ends up with the economy picking up some steam. And what the fed is doing in that case, it's supplying extra liquidity to the system. 
>> But now we're in a situation, we're awash in liquidity. We've already got, I mean, interest rates are zero. And so anybody you say, "well, we're going to give you some more cash and you're going to go lend it out," and banks, everybody's going to say, "well, why would I want to do that? I mean, interest rates are zero. It's, there's no particular incentive for me not to just sit on this cash." So you pour this extra liquidity into the economy and it just sits there. And that's the liquidity trap. It's a situation in which the ordinary monetary policy thing doesn't work. A side consequence of that is it also means that if the government goes out and borrows more, it's not going to drive up interest rates because there's all this cash sitting out there looking for a place to go. So the rules change. And liquidity traps are really rare. I mean, we had one in the 1930s and we've had another one since 2008. And aside from that, we had one in japan in the 1990s, and that's about it. But when they happen, boy, they change all the rules. You find yourself in a different universe for economics. 
>> And they're not putting people to work. 
>> That's right. A liquidity trap is a situation where the economy can stay depressed and there's no natural, certainly no fast natural route to recovery. 

[00:32:09]


>> So why would you be calling for more spending, given that reality? 
>> Oh, but that's the point, then the equation, what we're looking for always, the problem. Basically all recessions are a problem of not enough spending in the economy. There are a few exceptions, basically, what we call a recession is, a case where there's not enough spending, and so there's not enough jobs. Normally, however, you can deal with that in a very narrow technocratic fashion, which is that the federal reserve cuts interest rates and stuff happens. Now that doesn't work because we're in a liquidity trap. And so, this is where you say, "okay, we need something else that's going to work, and it's very hard to come up with anything that is clearly effective, other than having the government go out and spend the money that the private sector won't." And this is why it, you know, this is, monetary policy is the aspirin of conomic ailments. Take a couple whenever you're feeling that you have a headache. Now we had the over the counte reme doesn't work and we need the, the heavy duty prescription medicine, and that's what I'm arguing for. 
>> Interesting you say that because I tried to condense to one sentence the message and argument of your book. And I wrote down, "the answer is simple. Increase spending and boost consumption because the fundamental problem at the root of this crisis is a lack of demand." 
>> That's it. Now you can say that all crises', or most crises' anyway, most recessions are a lack of demand. But this is an intractable lack of demand. And so, we, we need we need government action of a type that most, at any point during the past 70 years, except this one, I would have said, "no, let's leave it up to my former colleague, ben bernanke." But he can't do the job right now. And so, we need the government. 
>> And if the president were sitting across the table from you and asking, "where would you spend this money, paul?" What would your answer be? 
>> Right now it's easy because right now we can do it very quickly simply by restoring the spending cuts that have already happened. If you gave me unlimited carte blanche in terms of spending, i would want to go beyond that. I'd want to talk about and pretty straightforward things, even so. We have you know, fix the sewer lines. I mean, we have, we have a lot of, a lot of basic infrastructure needs that are worth doing in any case. But right now you can get a quick boost just by rehiring those school teachers and filling those potholes. We are something like $300 billion a year short of the spending that we should be undertaking just for the normal business of government. And that extra $300 billion a year would be a really big deal for the economy if we could do it right now. 

[00:34:47]


>> Would it bring us to what you call full employment? 
>> Probably not. Probably bring us down to an unemployment rate that was more in the 6% to 6.5%. 
>> How much would it add to the long term deficit? 
>> Actually, nothing to the long term deficit, or almost nothing because this would not be a permanent set of measures. This would be something we'd do now. It would add headline suppose we spend $300 billion a year right now, additional. That's not $300 billion a year in extra debt because it's, the economy will be stronger, which means more revenue, which means less spending on unemployment benefits. So it's probably under $200 billion a year in immediate borrowing. And there's a lot of reason to think that would actually, having a stronger economy now would actually strengthen the economy in the long run as well. Or put it this way, the other way, that having a really weak economy now is damaging our future and not just our present. Think about all college graduates who will never get the job they all should get. That's not just harm for them, that's a future economy that is weaker than it should've been because it's wasting a lot of our talent. And there's a pretty good case, actually a pretty strong case, that if you think about the long run fiscal impact, spending more right now is actually positive even in terms of the long run budget situation because a stronger future economy will mean stronger revenue down the pike. And the debt we incur right now, well, you know, the interest rate on u.S. Long term debt is under 2%. Inflation protected u.S. Long term debt has a negative interest rate. There's almost no, there's even, on purely fiscal terms, it's arguab that we should be spending more just to strengthen our long run budgesit potion. 
>> Is there a limit to how much we can keep borrowing? 
>> There may be, although all that we know, all of the evidence says it's a lot further away than conventional wisdom has it. I mean, like a lot of people, including ben bernanke, I got into all of these things by looking at japan in the '90s. And japan famously has run deficits year after year. And it has a level of debt that is about twice what we've got as a share of gdp. And people have been predicting financial catastrophe for japan year after year for ten years or more. They've had downgrades. Their debt was downgraded in 2002 by the major rating agencies. And everybody who believed those warnings and everybody -- has lost a lot of money. So it turns out that if you're an advanced country with its own currency and a reasonably stable government, you have a lot of running room on these things. So am I worried? Yeah, I mean, I am worried about the u.S. Fiscal situation 20 years from now. We do have a problem of health care costs and so on. But, you know, I'm worried about a lot of other things 20 years as well. I'm not sure that even if you take that long term perspective, that the budget should be at the top of your list of things to be afraid of. I'm a lot more afraid, actually, of the great -- the entire southwest of the united states turning into a dustbowl because of climate change, right? So sure, by all means, let's think about it. But it should not be dominating our policy discussion now. 

[00:38:07]


>> As you know, we're heading toward another knockdown, drag out, shoot it out at the o.K. Corral fight over raising the debt ceiling in a few weeks. President obama has already said he will not negotiate on raising the debt ceiling. Here's what he said. 
>> I will not have another debate with this congress over whether or not they should pay the bills that they've already racked up through the laws that they passed. Let me repeat. We can't not pay bills that we've already incurred. 
>> And here's the response he got the next day from republican senator pat toomey of pennsylvania. 
>> Our opportunity here is on the debt ceiling. The president's made it very clear; he doesn't even want to have a discussion about it, because he knows this is where we have leverage. We republicans need to be willing to tolerate a temporary partial government shutdown, which is what that could mean, and insist that we get off the road to greece, because that's the road we're on right now. We only can solve this problem by getting spending under control and restructuring the entitlement programs. There is no tax solution to this. It's a spending solution. And if this president doesn't want to go there, we're going to have to force it and we're going to have to force it over the debt ceiling. 
>> This is a guy walking into a crowded room and saying, "i have a bomb strapped to my chest, and if you don't give me what i want, I'm going to blow up everybody, including myself." And is that a credible threat? Well, there're some pretty crazy people there. And it might be that they're willing to do it. But by the same token, obama cannot get into this because then you have government in the hands of -- never mind the constitution, the government is run by whoever is most willing to wreak havoc with our whole system of -- with the nation. We cannot allow ourselves to be blackmailed into spending cuts, partly because blackmail should not be part of how the u.S. Operates, and partly because spending cuts would be disastrous right now. So obama's right to say he doesn't negotiate. I'd like to know exactly what he will do if it turns out that there is not a quorum of sane people in the republican party. 
>> If you were secretary of the treasury, what would you recommend he do? 
>> I'm for whatever gimmick works. So the most dignified is to say, "look, this is ridiculous. You are giving the president -- effectively congress is giving the president inconsistent instructions. It's passed bills mandating spending. It's passed bills that give us inadequate revenue to cover that spending which requires that we borrow. And then you're saying, 'i can't borrow.' well, you know. And my reading of the constitution is I have to obey the due legislative process and go ahead and do this borrowing to meet the bills that we've already incurred, as the president said." That's sort of what people are calling the fourteenth amendment solution, that basically it's unconstitutional to give into this debt limit thing. I guess that's your best lution. They don't think that that's workable then you go for anything at hand. And there is this wonderful bit about the platinum coin. 

[00:40:50]


>> I don't understand that. 
>> In a 1997 act amended in 2000 which covers issuance of coins and stuff like that. There's one clause that says that the secretary of the treasury shall have the right to mint and issue platinum coins in any denomination that he so chooses. Clearly, the intent was commemorative coins. You're going to strike a coin to commemorate whatever, mother's day. But it doesn't say that. And as far as legal scholars have been able to make out, there's no reason why the secretary of the treasury can't order the minting of a coin that says this coin is worth $1 trillion, which need bear no relationship to the actual value of the platinum in it. It has to be platinum, however. And walk that coin over to the federal reserve. Deposit it in and have the federal reserve create a bank account for the federal government based on that coin of whatever. It could be one coin for $1 trillion, it could be a thousand coins of a billion each, whatever. And then the government can pay its bills by drawing on that bank account. And it's crazy, it's an accounting gimmick, but then this whole thing is crazy. And if that lets you bypass this nonsense about the debt limit, fine. There are other routes. I mean, it's possible the government could issue coupons that look like debt and function like debt, but says, "no, they're not debt." They could say, "this -- we have no legal obligation to pay this. We are, in fact, going to pay it, but we have no legal obligation to pay it." That's another alternative. They could-- 
>> this is what you'd call-- 
>> I'd call it moral obligation coupons. 
>> Moral obligation because the government is morally obligated to pay that at some point, right? That's what-- 
>> that's right. 
>> You mean by that? 
>> Yeah. So, but it's a moral obligation. We can say it's not a legal obligation so that -- you know, all of this is of course, this is all word games. But then that's not to play games would be irresponsible at this point. 
>> So you would encourage, if you were secretary of the treasury, the president to call the republican bluff? 

[00:42:54]


>> Yes. I think, now, I think you probably don't commit to doing that until we actually hit the limit. You say what the president is now saying. There is no alternative but for congress to do the responsible thing and raise this debt limit. But you don't rule out these alternatives and you make sure that the republicans know you haven't ruled it out so that it stands ready, and in fact it's what you do. Hostage negotiations, you have to -- you have to have some credible alternative to giving into the hostage takers demands, and that's where we are right now. 
>> You've confessed before to an occasional sinking feeling that you can count on president obama to wimp out. And that's your term, "to wimp out" when it matters. 
>> Yeah. The 2011 debt ceiling fight was deeply disheartening because he should not have negotiated on the debt ceiling at all. Same argument as now. This is not how you do it. It is not a legitimate tactic of politics to threaten to destroy the country if you don't get what you want. And people who make thatemand have no standing. You should not give them anything. But he did. He actually did, in fact, make some significant concessions on spending, in order to get a rise in the debt limit. He blinked a little bit on the fiscal cliff. Not as badly as some of us feared, but he did not, in fact, hold out for the full revenue package. And so, some of us are worried. Now, I have to say, I mean, I'm reading my own stage directions here. People like me are, in part, going after him, warning about the wimping out thing in order to turn that into a self-denying prophesy. That the idea is to make a situation where the president will be aware what people will say about him if he does give in here so it doesn't happen. 
>> More than many economists i read, you keep politics at center stage in writing about the economy. Those are two different narratives in one sense. And yet, you intertwine them as you keep writing and analyzing our situation today. Why is that? 

[00:45:10]


>> I think we've reached a moment in our history where the extreme nature of our politics and the extreme nature of the economic situation has converged. You know, here we are, on one side we have a once-in-three-generations economic crisis. Right, this is -- starting in 2008, we've been experiencing the crisis that has haunted the nightmares of macro economists since the 1930s. And here it is again. And this is as dramatic as it gets. It's a situation where you really have to throw out the business as usual. And on the other side, you have this extreme political situation, where a radical movement has taken over one of our two great political parties. And does not -- does not practice politics as usual. Anyone who talks about, "well, we should make deals the way we used to. What about the tax reform of 1986? Why can't we do that again?" And the answer is, well, that might make sense to you if you've been in a buddhist monastery for the past 20 years. But that's not today's republican party. You can't make that kind of deal with them. And so, how can you write about the economics? If you write about economics right now and implicitly adopt the perspective, "well, let's get reasonable people together in washington and reach a solution here," you know, you're paying no attention to reality. And, of course, if you talk about the politics without talking about the economics, you're also missing everything. So how could I not be writing about both? 
>> You begin one chapter of your book with a quote from your intellectual mentor, john maynard keynes, who writes in his masterpiece "the general theory of employment, interest and money," "the outstanding faults of the economic society in which we live --" and this was the '20s and '30s, "are its failure to provide for full employment. And its arbitrary and inequitable distribution of wealth and incomes." Well, we don't have full employment today and we have gross inequality in income. So which is failing us, capitalism or democracy or both? 

[00:47:32]


>> I guess I have a -- here's where I guess I am an optimist, which is that I believe that you can fix both capitalism and democracy. Not to produce a utopia, but to produce a workable solution. And the reason I believe that is we did that for a pretty long stretch. Western economies in 1933 and western societies in 1933 were in a pretty horrible state. Mass unemployment, gross inequality, collapse of democracy in a number of places. And in the end, by the time 1950 had rolled around, we had managed to create a more equitable, not totally equal, but a more equitable society, with reasonably full employment. And that solution lasted for half a century, which is all you can ever expect in human affairs. Nothing is permanent. So I do believe that we can do that again. So it's not that we have to ditch capitalism. I think a market economy is -- this is probably churchill, right, it's the worst solution except for all the others. And democracy is the worst system, except for all the others. But it's going to take some work. It's not -- the idea that you can just let markets rip and that you don't need to worry about the state of your democracy, that's wrong. But I'm actually, in a way, a conservative on these things. But a conservative, not -- what we now call conservatives are actually radicals who want to tear down the structure that we built, starting with fdr. And I want to rebuild something like that, a modernized, a 21st-century version of that system. But it's not out of reach. It's not something that can't be done. 
>> Paul krugman, "end this depression now." Thank you very much for this conversation. 
>> Thank you. 
>> There's a chapter called "the second gilded age" in paul krugman's book where he describes the extraordinary rise in wealth and power of the very rich during this era of unregulated greed. Since ronald reagan's election in 1980, the top 1% of americans have seen their incomes increase by 275%. But after accounting for inflation, the typical hourly wage for a worker has increased just $1.23 cents. Big money, as krugman writes in this book, buys big influence. And that's why the financiers of wall street never truly experience regime change -- because their cash brings both parties to heel. So, the policies that got us where we are today -- in this big ditch of chronic depression -- have done little for most, but have been very good to a few at the top. But those at the top are not satisfied with having only most of it -- they want it all. And if he were writing his book today, krugman could find plenty of evidence in the deal that supposedly kept us from going over the fiscal cliff. Behind closed doors, congress larded it with corporate tax breaks worth tens of billions of dollars -- everything from tax credits for nascar racing and the railroads to subsidies for hollywood. Rebates for the rum industry and loopholes for off-shore financing that could help giant multinationals like general electric avoid billions of dollars in corporate income taxes. Writing in "the washington examiner," columnist tim carney says many of these expensive giveaways were "spawned by a web lobbyists, donors and staffers surrounding democratic sen. Max baucus of montana" chairman of the senate finance committee. As we know from the obamacare fight, baucus is a connoisseur of revolving door corruption. "Pick any one of the special-interest tax breaks extended by the cliff deal," carney wrote, "and you're likely to find a former baucus aide who lobbied for it on behalf of a large corporation or industry organization." Even the pro-business "wall street journal" was appalled. They called it a "crony capitalist blowout." Ceo's and lobbyists were tripping over themselves as they traipsed up and down pennsylvania avenue between congress and the white house, privately protecting their interests as they publicly urge austerity on everyone else. Here's lloyd blankfein, ceo and chair of the global investment giant goldman sachs, when asked by cbs news' scott pelley about how he would reduce the federal deficit. 

[00:52:06]


>> You're going to have to undoubtedly do something to lower people's expectations the entitlements and what people think that they're going to get, because it's not going to they're not going to get it. 
>> Social security, medicare, medicaid? 
>> Some things. And you know, you can go back and you can look at history of these things, and social security wasn't devised to be a system that supported you for a 30-year retirement after a 25-year career. Entitlements have to be slowed down and contained. 
>> Because we can't afford them going forward? 
>> Becau we can't afford them. 
>> Ah, yes, but goldman makes sure their entitlements aren't touched. Here's the story. After 9/11, congress created tax-exempt liberty zone bonds to help small businesses rebuild near ground zero. Turns out goldman's friends in high places consider it a small business, too, although it made $5.6 billion dollars in profits last year. As the fiscal cliff fiasco was playing out over new year's eve, faster than the ball dropped in times square, a deal was struck in washington that will extend the subsidies for goldman's fancy new headquarters in lower manhattan. In their 43 stories of glass and steel, and a footprint two city blocks long, goldman sachs reigns supreme, thanks to a system rigged by and for the powerful rich. And then this. Just hours before the fiscal cliff deal's higher individual tax rates kicked in, goldman handed lloyd blankfein and his top lieutenants "a total of $65 million in restricted stock," bonuses awarded a month earlier than usual so they could all beat the coming tax hike from which they have been spared for more than 10 lucrative years. It will not surprise you, I am sure, to learn that "corporations announced more special dividends last month than iy other december since at least 1955." Doing everything they can to avoid helping pay off the debt their ceos have been urging congress to cut. As for working people, tough luck. Because the fiscal cliff deal ends the cut in payroll taxes, the average worker this year will take home about a thousand dollars less. ?????? Hey when paul gets really bummed out that's when I ?????? ?????? get scared but when paul says there's a glint of home ?????? ?????? I feel we've all been spared ??????

=======================================================

>>> Heavy fighting in the suburbs of damascus as syrian fighter jets bomb rebel held areas. We will talk about what the nearly two-year civil war means today. You're watching msnbc. 
>> We just need to let the world know we are not okay. 
>> They need to get down here and do it quickly. 
>> We need it to happen two months ago. 
>>> The victims of hurricane sandy call for action from congress. We will get views from new york and new jersey. What do these things have in common? Cockroaches, traffic jams and lindsay lohan. They are all more popular than congress. Can lawmakers be effective on capitol hill? 
>>> President obama has gotten pushback for just about every cabinet member. Concerns about hagel's nomination for defense secretary topped today's sunday talks. 
>> Overall temperment and is he suited to run a department or big agency like the pentagon. 
>> Whether he really believes that the surge was the worst blunderer since the vietnam war, that clearly is not -- that is not correct. In fact, it is bizarre. Why would he oppose calling the iranian revolutionary guard a terrorist organization? 
>> Peter alexander is at the white house where that nomination was announced. Good afternoon to you. What is the president's strategy for dealing with these sorts of road blocks from republicans ahead of hagel's hearing? 
>> Reporter: It is clear that the administration, the white house, specifically stands behind chuck hagel and is waiting for hearings to take place and they say it is only at that time that they will see exactly how chuck hagel will react to pushback. Colin powell referred to hagel as having a diminished public record. He will be as secretary of defense the first grunt as it were ever to serve as secretary of defense and powell said because he put his own life at risk he would be the best suited person to be in charge of other lives. It is clear that the white house feels very confidently that this will go forward even though there are questions. 

[00:02:53]


>> As we continue to look at the president's team as he starts to make nominations. We saw secretary of labor resign last week. We will look at names that might resign. Steven chu one of the names. Any word on them departing anytime soon? 
>> Reporter: Those are good questions. We don't know just yet. It is familiart that there would be a changing of the guards between airst and second term. As it goes in churmz of steven chuit remains to be seen. Some names would be byron dorgen, the democrat from north dakota. Governor of the state of washington as well as jennifer gran. We know of one likely departure that we should hear about. That is a name not familiar to a lot of americans. She served as a deputy chief of staff to the president. It is likely that she is going to leave. There has been a lot of conversation about the number of women that have surrounded the president in this new cabinet. The last four positions we have seen were all men. Nancy's name was not thrown around yet and some people are saying more women's names should have been considered. 
>> Peter alexander, thank you so much and we will be utopping back with you to talk about immigration. 
>>> With chuck hagel's nomination looking like a tough one powell had this to say on "meet the press" this morning. 
>> I think he will do a great job as secretary of defense. I think all of these issues that you have raised he will be prepared to deal with. I have read responses he has put together and I think he will make a spirited and defense of his position. 

[00:04:55]


>> Let'sng in senior congressional reporter and congressional reporter for "role call." I was reading one of your recent articles that read has kirk's office been running a secret hagel campaign? How much weight can an endorsement like colin powell's be for hagel, a republican here when he is pushing forward this candidate despite some of the contentious discussions so far even as you were writing a fellow republican not liking hagel at the moment? 
>> I think you are right in saying that this has been a bit of a contentious nomination that the president has made but it is going to be very, very difficult to see how a block large enough to basically filibuster this nomination will with emerge. There has been speculation that prominent jewish candidates could get in the way. You will see floor speeches that question mr. Hagel's commitment to israel or his commitment to iranian sanctions. I think in a lot of ways the republican critique of his nomination comes sort of as a general critique of his position when he came out after having voted originally for the iraq war and also just an ally of the president. In a lot of ways for the republicans this has been one of another proxy battles with president obama. It is as much about the feelings about him as their feelings about chuck hagel. 
>> Those feelings come from the left as you were talking about. 
>> I am not comfortable yet. I want to ask him questions about those two issues. 
>> Democratic senator richard blumenthal with that statement there. As you were writing you said as chuck schumer goes so goes hagel. 

[00:07:01]


>> That's right. Chuck schumer is probably the most important voice in this debate on the democratic side right now. Really the only way that chuck hagel doesn't get confirmed right now is if democratic senators come out in opposition to him. There is going to be a balk of republican senators who will vote against hagel for the reasons you mention. 
>> Do you think schumer will go against this nomination? 
>> I think it is unlikely at this point. Chuck hagel will have to really assure both schumer, blumenthal, other jewish democrats that he would be a staunch advocate for israel. I'm sure he will do that. If he slips up in any way in the hearings or if a lot of the groups off of the hill that are very influential try to derail after the hearings it will be very hard for some democrats to vote for him. Absent that I think his confirmation is affirmed. 
>> Let's change subjects to afghanistan that came up throughout this week. I want to play a little sound here from retired army general stanley McCrystal. 
>> I have a lot of feelings about what happened and the most is that responsibility is key. There is no point in finger pointing. I have regrets that some of the things that I was responsible for I didn't finish. I didn't finish the job in afghanistan. 
>> What is your thought here? What lessons do you think congress will take away from this war? 
>> Well, I think that it shows how complicated it is to fight long-term wars in the current world that we live in. This has been going on now for more than a decade and it's created complicated regional issues that we obviously didn't understand clearly at the on set. Most people weren't concerned that we were doing the right thing particularly in the wake of 9/11. War is complicated. I think we will see the conversations as the senate tries to confirm chuck hagel. You look at the kind of outside influnss that weigh into the debates. All of the outside forces on the hill could put pressure on the members which is what got chuck hagel in trouble in the first place. One of the most controversial was a statement about apec. Referred to it as the jewish lobby and how members respond to that and how they craft their views on policy on that. You have all of these things that we see in washington whether outside groups or allegiances among lawmakers. At the end of the day people tend to lineup behind the president particularly in issues of foreign policy when serious matters like deciding to go to war or imposing sanctions on other countries are concerned. You have to demonstrate unity. 

[00:10:14]


>> Stick around. We will be speaking with you later this hour. I look forward to that conversation. 
>>> Former president george h.W. Bush would leave the hospital early this week. The latest on the elder bush's condition. 
>>> Plus heavy fighting and air strikes around damascus. What is mns for the united states next. 
>>> What former first star thinks is way off. We will tell you who is speaking out. ?????? ??????

>>> you are looking at amateur video of syrian war planes attacking. That happened a little earlier today. Those air strikes are part of the government's latest offensive against the rebel bases. Let's bring in. Good to have you here. Let's talk about this back and forth. Is it still in a see saw condition? Do you see this breaking any which way? 

[00:14:33]


>> We don't see any significant changes. What we are seeing on the ground are incremental operations on both sides? They take over a military base and get heavier weapons. They fight back with aircrafts and heavier guns. We have seen this kind of status quo for the past eight or nine months without any significant tipping balance into one another's favors. 
>> Four syrians, 60,000 killed so far at least. And many places where they don't have electricity and basic needs being met. 
>> The conditions on the ground, complete disaster. The people there you mentioned 60,000 people killed on all sides of the conflict. 600,000 displaced. Close to 2 million people displaced inside syria meaning they have left their homes trying to find shelter elsewhere. Every national organization i spoke to has described a dire humanitarian situation that is exacerbated that we are in the middle of winter. No blankets. It is a very grim picture for people. 
>> Bashar al assad still in power, not going to step down. Russia the key player there. That is just one outside influence. We have the united states and the u.K. Wanting him to step aside. You have things happening to the south and to the coast. What sort of environment are we looking at in terms of what assad might do next? 
>> It is extremely chaotic and unpredictable. Because of the internationalization, much has been said this is part of war. With the money coming into it and the weapons, money from the gulf country to the rebels. It is a regional conflict. The fighting is taking place and has regional complications. 
>> Chemical weapons. I believe his statement is he said earlier he is alluding to the chemical weapons and said it could involve u.S. Troops saying you have to keep the possibility that if there is a peaceful transition and international organizations get involved that they might ask for assistance in that situation. So defense secretary paneta discussing troops and the weapons. 

[00:16:56]


>> For u.S. And israel, they hint the fact that they would use force if they needed to ensure them is it falling into the hands of people that could be dangerous. Dictators use chemical weapons. In a moment of desperation if this regime feels its back is against the wall and time is running out it may resort to the weapons. 
>> How about loose chemical weapons? 
>> Even if they aret used by the regime the concern is somebody can get their hands on them and smuggle them out of the country or use them in conflict. 
>> Russian forces you were telling me they have a naval base there and there was also recently warships in e mediterranean undertaking practice there, war games, if you will. What is the calculus when we look at russia and its military apparatus and its existence? 
>> This is the last major military base in the middle east. It still sees syria as a satellite state. It has a naval base there and has several russian citizens. Russia said it will evacuate its citizens. There is a flexing of the military muscle in the region. Nobody is fearing russian military involvement but gives you a sense of how quickly it can exploet. 
>> Right now as you were saying at the start of the conversation it doesn't look like we will see anything different than the see-saw situation we have seen. 
>>> Coming up dress rehearsal. What it takes to get ready for a presidential inauguration and how washington could find itself in a new jersey state of mind. ?????? ??????

>>> as a nation copes with the deadly flu outbreak the centers for disease control say only 36.5% of all americans received the flu shots as of november 2012. Policy researchers say many adults opt against the shot gauze employers do not require workers to get it unlike schools that generally require it. Here is a quick look at some of the other top stories.

>>> The family of aaron schwarz is blaming government officials for his death. The 26-year-old hanged himself friday in his apartment. He was facing federal charges for computer hacking. His family says his death was a product of intimidation. 
>>> Nbc news has learned former president george h.W. Bush could be headed home early this week. The house is expected to take up a $50 billion hurricane sandy relief package when it reconvenes this week. It has been nearly 80 days since the storm slammed into the northeast. The house cancelled a vote in december but did approve a smaller measure funding flood insurance. Those actions outraged new york and new jersey lawmakers. Let's bring in one of the officials, mayor ed johnson from new jersey. Thanks for being here with us. 
>> Good afternoon. 
>> Do you think congress will get it done this week when they return to the hill? 
>> We are very hopeful. Our contacts in washington say that there will be a vote on tuesday, the 5th which is martin luther king's birthday. We hope our congress willake that day to show leadership and compassion. We understand it will be broken into two votes, the house republican leadership is putting up about a $17 billion version. And then we have the original $60 billion total passed by the senate which will also be considered. 50 billion, the remainder there. How have you been able to pay for the bills in between. You have not stopped recovery efforts. 

[00:29:57]


>> We are already $10 million deep into funding for recovery and rebuilding efforts. We are using the credit cards. That is exactly what many shore communities are doing. We can't wait for lack of leadership in washington. The summer season is our bread and butter and we really have to get things going now in order to be prepared for the coming season. 
>> When do you hit your credit line? How much longer can you survive? 
>> Well, we are going to continue to move forward and we will survive and get this done. 
>> A month? Two months? 
>> I think were in better shape than that with $10 million that we are taking action this next wednesday which will fund things like the reconstruction of the boardwalk, damage to our sewer plant and other structural damage around town. It is unexpected. It does hit us hard but we will make it. We just received reimbursement from hurricane irene earlier this year. And that is the normal fast track. So while we are laying out the expenses we will do everything we can to recoup them from insurance and from disaster assistance. 
>> I want to get your reaction to a fellow mayor in new jersey. That is corey booker out of newark. The stanford daily reprinted a column wrote back in 1990. It details evolution from a teen who quote hated gays to advocate for causes. This past friday mayor booker told wnbc why he wrote the column. Take a listen. 
>> I was a participant in this ignorance and that is why as a 22-year-old I wrote such a dramatic article shining a light at myself in hopes that I could be a bridge builder. 

[00:31:57]


>> Do you accept that evolution? 
>> All of us have had an evolution and a change of heart. We have all said and done some pretty dumb stuff. That certainly was one of them. I have to take it at face value. I have worked with cory booker. I have seen him in action on the city council and newark now and his work as mayor. I think the totality of his work and contributions to society, not just here in new jersey, in america and world wide certainly does speak volumes to his evolution and becoming aware of how we need to -- 
>> you accept his explanation? 
>> I certainly do. 
>> Thank you for coming today. 
>> Thank you. 
>>> Mayor booker's evolution is not the only reason we are talking about him today. Booker filed papers that allow him to explore a run for a senate seat. Booker was asked on "meet the press" if he will run and here is what he said. 
>> This campaign is over a year away. You know new jersey has to focus on a governor's race and a legislative race. I have to file. 
>> You are not ruling out challenging? 
>> I am not ruling out anything but it is premature to be speculative. 
>> Let's go to our political war room. As a senior fellow at the family research council. Good to see you. What do you think about what the mayor is doing here? Stepping on toes maybe? 
>> He is. Let's not kid ourselves. To take on somebody of that stature and long standing service to new jersey. He is 89 but he doesn't act 89. He is witty and resourceful and delivering for the state. Cory booker knows that. He is somebody that booker has had to look to to get the kind of coverage for relief for hurricane sandy that everybody is so desperate for. On the other handbooker knows he is stepping on toes but he knows lautenberg is 89. We saw senator rockefeller step down yesterday and there have been challenges that were successful. Dale bumpers took on a senator four years ago and we saw senator specter lose in a primary. It happens. Nobody likes it but it is a factor within the party. That is life in modern politics. 

[00:34:30]


>> Some of the statements being made, there was report t top aid was not happy about where cory booker might be going. Is he handling it the right way? Getting these statements said by top aids is there a better way of moving forward? 
>> To read between the lines it sounds like mayor booker tried to reach out without any success so far. You can't really begrudge senator lautenberg thinking you will have your time. I am doing what the people in the state want. But I think what he is doing is getting his foot in so that if senator lautenberg decides he has had it and made money in a past life and has a beautiful younger wife and can enjoy himself now he may decide who needs the aggravation in the senate and cory booker would be presumably next in line. 
>> I don't think -- in the final analysis I think what cory is doing is pretty smart. He is placing a bet that frank is not going to run again and he is trying to position himself at the head of the line for anybody else who might aspireo replace frank. And so this is not a game for wall flowers or folks who are -- at the end of the day it is a pretty darwinian game. 
>> Listen to this. This is what booker said in that wnbc interview. 
>> As frustrated as I was with him for taking time to evolve, as h said, it was a glorious thing to see the first president of the united states stand up and affirm equality. 

[00:36:32]


>> Talking about same sex marriage and marriage equality. Should republicans reconsider their stance on issues such as same sex marriage? 
>> I don't think so. Earlier today colin powell talked about the dark vein of intolerance. That plays both ways when you have folks on the left who will take a defense of traditional marriage as being an act of bigotry. I think we need to grow up and play this out in the public arena and in the legislate chb bodies of the country. 
>> The president's comments made before the election did assist in getting a large gay vote to go his way. 
>> That was a political strategy and it was a political convenience strategy. 
>> Can republicans ignore that development? 
>> I think so. I think if you look at across these united states 32 states have basically been supportive of traditional marriage. I think that is the prevailing view in the country. And I think it will be the prevailing view in the highest court in the land. 
>> We'll stay in new jersey. That is our state for the day. Governor chris christie is riding a wave of popularity. Three quarters of the voters approve of the job he is doing. Should new jersey democrats put up a candidate to run against christie. 
>> I think you always as a party -- it is a blue state. Let's not kid ourselves. Hats off to governor christie for having the standing he does. If the democratic party in new jersey can't find somebody to run a really serious campaign against him. Until sandy came along chris christie did not seem like the superman that he seems today. There were policy differences that split democrats and republicans seriously. The notion of him running for president I think is a joke. Marco rubio is in the senate because governor crist hugged president obama. Governor christie praised him and bad mouthed speaker boehner and the house republicans. I don't see those as positions that will work nationally in a republican primary. 

[00:38:59]


>> Do you think that hug is similar to what we are seeing with christie ie future because he works so closely that that will hurt him somehow perhaps from conservative republicans that have come out and said they are not the happiest with governor christie. 
>> The republican party is a center right party and governor christie is a pretty much centrist. That works well in new jersey. Running for the presidency or the nomination in the republican party I think is left and center views will probably not bode well for him. 
>> Even with being on the cover of "time" magazine. 
>> That might be the kiss of death. 
>> That might be the kiss of death right there. 
>> Maybe you and richard agree with that one there. Thank you both. 
>> Always good to be with you. 
>> Don't be on the cover of "time" magazine is what you are saying. 
>>> Which both occurred on this day in history? There is a lot happening on capitol hill today but none of it has anything to do with politics. We go behind the scenes coming up. lisa, quit. I honestly loved smoking, and I honestly didn't think I would ever quit.

>> The milestone in u.S. History. A week from today the nation's first black president gets officially sworn in for his second term. Preparations and rehearsals are already underway. That happening today in washington d.C. President obama actually gets sworn in twice this time. You know, twice because sunday is the official and monday is the ceremonial. 
>> Yes. The constitution says you have TO BE SWORN IN ON JANUARY 20th. Monday, martin luther king jr. Day. 
>> That is like having a birthday twice. He will have two bibles? 

[00:45:27]


>> He will have two. He is going to have three because the robinson family bible will be used on sunday and then abraham lincoln's bible. I think it is the first time he has two and the first time the martin luther king jr. Bible has been used. It is 50 years to the day that martin luther king stood at the lincoln memorial and said I have a dream. He will be facing the lincoln memorial. It is a really nice cycle here. 
>> It definitely is. We are hearing getting enough money to pay for the inauguration. They are short about $10 million from the $50 million we need. 
>> I think it is more the tough economic times. People have already given to barack obama with his record-breaking campaign and the democratic convention. They wanted the business community to come and help the load. His relation with them is not so great right now. He needs to work on them a second term. 
>> He was able to raise a billion dollars. It is a lot of money. Still in comparison. 
>> So he is having a hard time fundraising and yet tickets are going at a huge rate. I saw online some tickets are being sold for $6,000. Maybe too bad he can't sell his own tickets. 
>> You get the tickets. You are able to go to the inauguration and get to see some of the performers and we were talking about beyonce earlier last week. Major obama supporter. Then we have kelly clarkson. She is a ron paul supporter. 
>> She is. When the president calls and says please come sing I think you definitely want to perform. You have james taylor and the kids concert, alisha keys, john legend, usher, smoky robinson, the cast of "glee."

>> Plans on the ground, talk about that. I remember four years you couldn't move. You had to get out of your bed at 3:00 a.M. To get down to the mall in time because even the subways were so full. What do they expect this time around? 
>> Last time it was 1.8 million people. This time around they are expecting around 600,000 to 800,000 people. It will be smaller but no less grand. I think obviously d.C. Is really preparing for all of those things and you have to prepare early. Hopefully there won't be problems trying to get into the gates like there was last time for the swearing in ceremony and then we had the ticket master drama. 
>> The tickets are supposed to be free but now people are able to buy them as much as 2 grand on ebay and craigslist. Is this illegal? 
>> I don't think it is necessarily illegal. Senator schumer is in charge of the inaugural committee and he says he frowns upon it. 
>> I will see you there. I will get up at 5:00 a.M. Instead of 3:00 a.M. This time around.

>>> This has been a favorite all week. What's more popular than congress these days, and, well, you know, practically everything only a 14% approval rating. A recent poll compared congress to some pretty dislikable things, brussel sprouts, but actually I kind of like brussel sprouts. Used car salesmen, replacement refs and cockroaches and donald trump all more popular than congress. Congress has lots to do if cockroaches are edging them out in popularity. The 113th congress is not starting out on the right foot with the american people, but does this mean that they will be ineffective? Joining me now from washington rejoining us is manu raju, senior congressional reporter for politico and the congressional reporter for "roll call." Manu, 14% approval rating. We've seen it kind of, if you will, skip at the bottom now throughout the last year. Is the 113th going to be more popular? They are going to replace 90 members in both the house and the senate? 
>> I don't think so. 
>> No hope for that. You laugh. 
>> Look this is a congress that will have to resolve more crisis. This year of congressional politics really has been defined about lur,ing from crisis to crisis and narrowly avoiding these crises. This is coming up again in february when it's going to be time to raise the nation's debt ceiling, and there's no clear path in during that at this point. It will happen in march when they have to extend government funding, and will the government shut down if they don't? These budget battles will continue to nd congress, and there's really no way out, so if we -- if congress can't resolve a lot of these issues, you probably bet that that approval rating will be and will go even lower if that's possible. 
>> It is possible. The numbers, as we're looking at it just a moment ago, manu and meredith, hit in the 10% range not too long ago. The question is will they go single digit? On abc this week senator joe manchin had s things to say about getting things done in both chambers. Listen to this, and I'll get your reaction. 

[00:54:14]


>> Okay. 
>> I've yet to have a bipartisan meeting that's been organized where republicans and democrats in the senate sit down and work through their problems. Think about just in the senate we don't have that type of dialogue going on from democrats and republicans. We don't even know our colleagues over in the house. 
>> Don't even know our colleagues over in the house. You know, the whole fiscal cliff negoions, we saw that. Speaking all throughout the lead up to that deal coming down. Members of the house didn't know what was happening over in the senate, and even as the senator was saying there, senators not knowing what the leadership in the senate were doing. 
>> Well, so to go to manu's point, too, when we're going from crisis to crisis it's important to remember that congress has created these crises, not something sprung upon them, their inability to negotiate long-term deals before creates this infinite series of budget deadlines, but to the point of the senator, I think that it's not nearly as important that rank and file senators know rank and file house members. In fact, it's nearly impossible for that to happen and in the long scheme of thing that's not something that's common, but i think trust among the leadership teams of both the house, the senate and the white house is very important, and so I think about baseball, right? I'm a pretty big baseball fan and you think about the mendoza linethe very base bottom line that batters can hit, and congress has set the bar so low that maybe we'll be surprised and see it be exceeded this congress. I mean, there are a lot of bipartisan issues or issues that they could make into bipartisan issues, whether it's on immigration. You saw a lot of republican senators especially coming out after the election saying that congress had to do something about that or maybe even gun control, although that's going to be a tricky issue as well. 
>> Talking about the mendoza line, a line that continues to get lower and lower and that has to do with the debt in terms of how much the country owes. Manu, what does it say when the president was being encouraged by senate democrats to use the 14th amendment and go past congress with the debt ceiling plan. You were writing about that earlier in the week. Reid to obama, it's okay to skip congress on the debt ceiling. 

[00:56:20]


>> That's right. I mean, that just shows how there's really no way out of this situation at this point. The two sides are arguing completely different things. On the one side republicans are saying taxes cannot be considered a part of the equation, and we need to cut spending dollar for dollar for any deling increase. 
>> Right. The president is saying revenues must be part of an equation, and he does not want to use the debt ceiling as a bargaining chip. So what do they say, skip congress all together because they can't get it done. 
>> Manu raju of politico and marilyn of "roll call," thank you both very much. President obama may have a new immigration plan in the works and what does that mean for his second agenda? And you may have more cash to put in the bank. After the br we'll examine the reason why. You're watching the place for politics.Ain reliever by orthopedic doctors.

Choose unlimited rewards with 2% cash back or double miles on every purchase, every day! What's in your wallet? Here's your invoice. 
>>> Good afternoon. You're watching msnbc, the place for politics. This hour you've probably noticed you're getting less greenbacks in your paychecks. Coming up, could that get worse? Plus, as the vice president prepares to present his recommendations on gun control, what will congress do? We'll ask a senior house democrat, and speaking of congress, have the gop on capitol hill become the party of no simply as a way to get in the way of the president's agenda? This morning, we're learning more about president a's second-term agenda. Immigration reform is at the top of his legislative to do list. White house officials tell the "new york times" mr. Obama and senate democrats will propose the changes in one comprehensive bill resisting efforts by some republicans to break the overhaul into smaller pieces. For more on these plans I want to bring in nbc'seter alexander what. Are you hearing about the single swoop approach to passing immigration reform? 
>> That first as you noted was reported by the "new york times" this past week reporting to this big ambitious overhaul plan that would be one comprehensive package as opposed to splitting some of these issues up independently as some republicans have been pushing more, thinking it may be more digestible for their base back in their home districts. Specifically when it comes to the issue of amnesty or legal status, that's b something heavily fought over. The president insists it's not amnesty. He said among the other elements that would exist in the proposals that are being cons right now, we're hearing from administration officials, are fines and back taxes for those. I think it's about 11 million undocumented workers, illegal immigrants presently living in the united states right now. The president acknowledged in his weekly radio address just yesterday that this is one of the difficult missions facing this country right now, richard, and obviously will be when you consider the fact that the president, as he pursues this, as he's likely, to according to the "new york times," even addressing it in the state of the union address on february 12th, HE'LL BE DEALING WITH Imgrion, gun control. We know about the confirmation hearing issues and then the fiscal, the debt ceiling which is fast approaching as well. 

[00:02:18]


>> Definitely that dance card is getting filled up pretty quickly so early in the year and he hasn't even been inaugurated. Also in that article, senator marco rubio preparing his own version of the d.R.E.A.M. Act. He discussed how republicans could face some pushback from latinos because of their stance on immigration reform. He said this, quote. We are going to have a struggle eaking to a whole segment of theation about our principles of limited government and free enterprise if they think we don't want them here, alluding to those who might benefit from the d.R.E.A.M. Act. So republicans have their own pr campaign to conduct with latinos on immigration reform, but how is the president going to combat republicans who want to see a more piece meal approach as we move forward here? 
>> Reporter: I think we've seen the way the president has handled other recent chaenges from his republican opposition when you consider just the fiscal cliff hanger as it were with campaign stops in various parts of the country. Consider a statistic that i think a lot of americans are going to refocus on is the immigration conversation returns to the fore. It's the fact that the president won 70% of the hispanic vote in this past election. A dramatic -- dramatic element in his success and obviously the republican party recognizes it's harsh language, some rhetoric used by mitt romney and other republicans around the country didn't help its chance of gaining support within that community. John boehner, the speaker of the house, has said that they need to have a more practical, a more pragmatic approach to this issue, so I think in many ways the white house feels confidently that -- that it has the lead on this issue right now and that it has the public on its side as well. 
>> All right. Nbc's peter alexander with that latest development. Thank you so much, peter. I want to bring in the political reporter for slate and msnbc contributor. Dave, what do you think about this? It's called comprehensive immigration reform, so is this a surprise at all? 
>> Oh, it's not a surprise. It was a promise that president obama made when he was elected the first time. 

[00:04:23]


>> Right. 
>> The worry I think if you're an advocate for this is when you read stories about who might support this. You don't see many house republicans being quoted. Great that marco rubio is on their side for a couple of pieces of this but senate republicans, as with the fiscal cliff deal, are going to be in the position of approving what can come through the house. 
>> Right. 
>> You need to hear probably 20-odd republicans who are worried enough about the issue you just mentioned to vote for this, and that didn't happen in 2005, didn't happen in 2007 when they would need to make up the -- some opposition from democrats. That's what we need to hear. We need to hear that this week possibly. 
>> And the timing didn't work out for president obama as he was pushing this forth in his new team. Early january he might put this out in the first week of his new administration. Is the iron so hot at this moment that he really does have to strike here and now? 
>> Because there are republicans worried about the future of their party if they don't do something, because it surprised me frankly after this election you didn't hear what you've heard after a few republican losses that there wasn't anything wrong with the party per se. Neath needed to message it better. On immigration it was just the voices calling for the -- calling for the preliminary opposition to any reform, much quieter than they have. We don't know if we're going to hear them bring it up again when the house comes back. A lot of people in the tea party movement, very influential in the base, very influential because the base agrees with them, weren't really loud on immigration, but back when we talked about 2007, people like steve king were at the forefront of stopping this, and we're going to start hearing from them again. We'll see if there's enough republicans to overwhelm them. An immigration bill would be something like the fiscal cliff passing with mostly democratic votes in the house. How many times can john boehner do in a? 
>> How many times will john boehner allow that to happen? Righ 
>> also, dave, we have something that maybe you noticed as well on friday, our paychecks, right. Hopefully we got our paychecks, and americans are starting to feel that pinch from that payroll tax holiday going away, and the president had said, you know, earlier on during the fiscal cliff deal and as the negotiations were going on that taxes would not go up for americans. What happened then is what a lot of people are asking at the moment? 

[00:06:38]


>> There was just a strange agreement between the democrats and the republicans to hold hands and jump off the cliff on this issue that we didn't really see coming because no one talked about it. This was an idea that got approved in the 2010 deal, extended in 2011, and you just didn't hear many republicans saying this -- calling this a -- a tax increase if they let it lapse. You didn't hear many democrats talking about it. I think the main reason that they -- they don't want fica taxes to get so low that people get used to paying an amount that can't fund the social security trust fund. It's odd because of all the things we discussed in the fiscal cliff. 
>> Yeah. 
>> Most of them wish use that might affect economic growth in the future. This was a tax that, according to most people rating it, was worth about 0.8 points of economic growth, and they -- no one talked about it. 
>> Few were talking about it. They were just trying to get to a deal as you're saying there now, dave. Now we're seeing this real impact on the paychecks, might there be political backlash from voters for the president or for republicans on this. I almost said the beauty. Kind of using the word ironically. The beauty of this issue like this where neither party advocated for it. Neither party thinks they can be blamed. 
>> Hurt by it. 
>> We know what republicans propose in various rounds of fiscal cliff negotiations, and they never proposed an extension to this. They could cynically say, look, and you hear some kind of republican pundits and talkers say this. They could say obama voters naively voted for this guy not realizing they were going to make him pay more money. Democrats would respond by saying you didn't try to raise t.Immigration, a lot of issues where you need more trust between democrats and republicans, there will be a lot of issues that both of them have to take a hair cut on. 
>> It's not going to start with this. 
>> Let talk haircuts, and the big one coming up is the debt ceiling and is the white house taking on a harder stance now that doesn't have to worry about re-election. The president not worried about 2016. 

[00:08:43]


>> It's a harder stance, but it's a more mystifying stance, and they are trying to dodge as many questions as possible about what we won't negotiate on the debt limit means, you know, you so over the weekend, to the surprise of a lot of people, treasury held off -- held off answering questions about the platinum coin idea which i probably don't need to summarize in total right now. They didn't really answer any questions. They just didn't have a response until over the weekend, basically the federal reserve made signals that it wasn't going to consider minting the coin and put it in the treasury and pay that for debt. They ruled now that solution, ruled out 14th amendment just saying that the president can continue raising the debt. So they are not saying how they are going to see the republican hostage-taking. 
>> Dave weigel of "slate" magazine. Thanks a lot. 
>> Vice president joe biden set to give his policy recommendations as early as tuesday. Joining me now is democratic congressman dave sicillini, thank you for being here with us. 
>> Vice president joe biden, he'll be making his recommendations on tuesday. What do you expect to hear from him. 
>> Well, I hope it will include some of the proposals that are already before the congress to fix the background check system and create a universal system so that every sale of a gun includes a background check to be sure that we close the broken system and ensure that information about the mental health conditions, particularly those adjudicated, are in the system to close the gun show loophole and close the fire sale when a licensed gun dealer has a license revoked. We really can fix the system and ensure that those are disqualified from possessing a firearm, criminals, those that are seriously mentally ill, don't have access to firearms, and I think his recomions can fix that system. There's legislation already propose that had we've introduced in the last congress and in this congress to address those issues, and it really does recognize people have a right to possess a firearm, but we all ought to agree people that are convicted criminals or seriously mentally ill should not have access to firearms and let's fix the background check system and close these gaping loopholes that's allowing people access to guns that shouldn't have them. 

[00:11:08]


>> What is your thought about the process that the vice president has undertaken as he has gone throughout the weeks to come up to his recommendations on tuesday? 
>> I think it's been a great process, look. 
>> This requires leadership from the president and vice president which they are providing. They have brought together stakeholders who have an interest in this issue. Listen to them carefully, going to put forth recommendations. We need to push them in the house and the senate. We need to have people all around this country who are raising their voices from demand to plan and mayors of illegal guns and to the brady center to at violence, all working together. 
>> And the nra left the meeting saying this was not the process that we thought it was going to be. 
>> Look, the nra has made it very clear that they are going to oppose all of these proposals. I think the president and vice president were right to listen to them, to bring them into the conversation, but we have a responsibility to make sure we keep children and family safe in this country. That we pass common sense gun legislation. The vast majority of the members of the nra support common sense gun safety legislation, closing the gun show loophole, making sure there's a good background check system. 
>> The fire sale one, if you are a licensed gun dealer and your license is revoked before you've engaged in some misconduct, haven't done proper reporting, your license is evoked your inventory is deemed a personal collection and they can sell it free from background checks at all. That's ridiculous. I mean, you're warding bad behavior so this would say you can't do that. 
>> Congressman, might that or other issues on the table right now, from the president's task force, might you see that come forward as an executive order. That was also something that the vice president said that they are considering those options there. 
>> I hope the president will use the power of his office to execute executive orders in a way that makes sense and we also have a responsibility in congress to -- 

[00:13:15]


>> the vice president some say riding high right now doing quite well after the fiscal cliff deal and very crucial to that negotiate process, and now that he's leading the gun control task force, it's a good place for him to be because he's hot right now, but on the flip side there are throws you remember in 1994 that there was a big part, a central part to the assault gun weapons ban back then, assault weapons ban.

>> After nearly two month in the hospal, the oldest living ex-president could be headed home early this week. An update on george h.W. Bush's health, and more than a year after dropping out of the race for the white house, one tea party darling is still in the red. But first the victims of hurricane sandy are still eagerly awaiting a vote on capitol hill. Could the pork in the bill derail the billions that they need? A senior member of the house joins us next. You're watching msnbc, the place for politics. Eagerly awaiting a vote on to arthritis means living with pain. It could also mean living with joint damage. Help relieve the pain and stop the damage with humira, adalimumab. For many adults with moderate to severe ra, humira is clinically proven to help relieve pain and stop joint damage. So you can treat more than just the pain. Humira can lower your ability to fight infections, including tuberculosis. Serious, sometimes fatal events, such as infections, lymphoma, or other types of cancer, have happened. Blood, liver and nervous system problems, serious alic reactions, and new or worsening heart failure have occurred. Before starting humira, your doctor should test you for tb. Ask your doctor if you live in or have been to a region where certain fungal infections are common. Tell your doctor if you have had tb, hepatitis b, are prone to infections or have symptoms such as fever, fatigue, cough, or sores. You should not start humira if you have any kind of infection. Ask your rheumatologist about humira, to help relieve pain and stop further joint damage before they stop you. @

>>> and for our president, you walk down here and made promises to us. You shook our hand. You talked to me face to face and said you're going to cut the red tape. Where the heck iu the red tape being cut? Because I sure haven't seen it. My neighbors haven't seen it. My friends haven't seen it. We are still fighting. 
>> Staten island residents demanding action two and a half months after getting pounded by hurricane sandy. A vote tops the agenda when the house convenes tomorrow. Joining me is the ranking member of the house foreign affairs committee. Congressman, thanks for being here. 
>> Thank you. Thanks for having me. 
>> Two votes, right, that are reallyng to be coming up. One on $17 billion for immediate sandy recovery needs, and then another 33 billion tha 67 house republicans voted -- another 33 billion. Now when we look back at the first round of relief earlier this month, 67 house republicans voted against that. Do you expect the same sort of numbers in terms of those who are against the 17 and the 33 billion come this week? 
>> Well, we really don't know. I hope not, but, you know, the first piece that 67 voted against was the easiest piece. You would think nobody would vote against that. That was flood insurance. These other pieces are very, very important, and, you know, a lot of us were very angry at speaker bainer when he pulled the bill abruptly just before the end of the last congress because the senate had already passed it, and all we had to do was pass the senate version, and it would have gone into law. By not acting upon it we kicked it back and now we have to start all over again, pass something in the house and then hopefully the senate will pass it, and people cannot wait even another week or another day. You know, when hurricane katrina hit, within ten days the people in the gulf coast got aid. Now in new york and new jersey and pennsylvania, connecticut, it's been 70 days, and people still have not seen the relief that they need. It's disgraceful. 

[00:20:04]


>> We were just speaking with mayor johnson and he said we're paying for this using our credit card, and right now we are $10 million into this. We're looking at mayors, city councils who you talk with very often that are now digging deep into these credit lines to keep the progress going, get their residents up and moving. 
>> Well, you know, there are arguments in washington about what the government should be, whether it's too big, too small, whatever it is, but I don't think anyone reasonably can say that government should not provide disaster relief to those parts of the country that have disasters. I've been in congress now for more than two decades, and whenever we had difficulty, whether it was katrina, whether it was hurricanes or tornadoes, we provided relief. If we're going to sit and have an argument or a discussion about offsetting or not offsetting it and meanwhile these people are sitting without help, that's unconscionable, and the federal government, if there's one thing the federal government should be doing, it is providing aid to american citizens who are in desperate need. No one can deny that the need isn't there, and so I think that if we're talking about offsets or anything like that, that should be a discussion for another day. It should not hold up aid to people from sandy. 
>> Like mayor johnson as we were talking about. 
>> Absolutely. He's moving forward. He said I'm not going to stop to continue to help the residents of my city. You know, some of the objections to the existing bills that are out there have resulted in a republican-led bill, $17 billion is what hou republicans would like to push forward. Is that something you would support? 
>> Well, I support the full 60 billion. That's what's needed. It's not padded. That's what's needed. If the 17 is the first or the second down payment of the 60, i would support it as long as you pass the others very quickly as well. It can't be a thing wre we pass 17 and then we wait a few months and then we pass again. If you have to rebuild and you have contracts that need to be let, you can't say to a contractor, well, I'll pay you for the first three months and we'll see if we can go get money from congress and come back. You've got to do the whole thing. It's not only, you know, restoring what happened, it's mitigation as well. We don't want to rebuild and then if another superstorm happens or another hurricane happens we have difficulty. We want to build stronger so we can expand. 

[00:22:37]


>> Be ready for the next disaster. The critics to the existing solutions out there, the original on january 1st that did not reach the floor that you were alluding to earlier, it that it includes a lot of other disasters from before, recovery efforts related to previous disasters and that those should not be included for this because this is specifically for sandy. What do you make of that criticism? 
>> Well, that was in the senate bill, in the original bill. It wasn't in the house bill, and I think that that criticism is just delaying tactics, quite frankly. I'm not for pork for other projects. I'm for sandy relief, but to kind of use that as an excuse not to do sandy relief is unconscionable. People who are suffering in staten island and long island and the sound shore of my district, we don't want excuses anymore. There are fights in congress, legitimate fight. Those fights have to happen, but it should not mix in with sandy aid. 
>> How real are those 67 votes that said no to the 9 billion? Is it just a protest vote, or is there a real concern that you're seeing on the right for this bill? 
>> Well, I don't know. I can't get into their heads, but I will tell you something. There are people there that took aid for their districts, you know, whether it's different parts of the country, whether it's the gulf coast or missouri or texas or -- or kansas. They took aid, and I voted for it, to help, when they had natural disasters, and I think it's just shameless and unconscionable that they are voting no for sandy aid. I think, again -- 
>> quid pro quo. 
>> It's quid pro quo and we're all americans and we have to help each other, and I know there are fights going on in congress now, and those fights will be taken care of, but our peopled help. People who have -- don't have roofs over their heads or cannot rebuild or businesses that are closing. They need help, and they need it now and it's unconscionable for anybody to need help. 
>> They were devastated, many parts of new jersey and new york still recovering from that. Thank you so much, congressman engel.

>>> It's official, almost, at least. George prescott bush, soften former florida governor jeb bush, has decided to continue the bush political dynasty. While he settled on run, the question is for what. He has his eye on the position of texas land commissioner, but he'll wait until after texas governor rick perry decides his plans, just in case that spot opens up there. Now let's head to the political playground for more. It seems that running for office comes with some strings attached, like paying your former staffers. Congresswoman and former presidential candidate michele bachmann has refused to pay five of her presidential campaign staffers more than a year after she dropped out of that race. Insiders saying she has refused to bay the $5,000 to her former staffers unless they agree to sign a non-disclosure agreement. The wisconsin assembly has some new rules. Not only are they installing time clocks to cut down on overnight debates, but members of the public will not be allowed to bring certain things into the gallery anymore. Apparently no more bags or briefcases will be allowed, but they can have concealed guns and other weapons if they have a permit. Speaking of guns. Lieutenant governor pete kinder of missouri who is likely to see congresswoman joanne emerson's seat is definitely showing he's pro gun. In regards to assault weapons he had this to say, quote. It's a misused term used by suburban soccer moms who do not understand what is being discussed here. That should go over well with female voters.

>>> Nbc news lass learned that former president george h.W. Bush could be headed home from a houston hospital sometime early this week. The 88-year-old has been hospitalized since late november for bronchitis and persistent fever. He spent some of that time in the intensive care unit as well. The former president spokesman says his team is taking everything one day at a time but perhaps some good news for everybody there. I'm richard lui, a look at some of the stories making news. Only 36.5% of all americans have received a flu shot as of november 2012. Policy researchers at the rand corporation say many adults opted against the shot because employers do not require workers to get it, unlike schools that generally require it for the children that attend their schools. Drivers can expect to feel a bit of a pinch in their wallets at the pump. Gas prices rose for the first time since october, up about seven cents. That's about 3.32 for regular. Officials in newtown, connecticut are holding the first of two public hearings on what to do with sandy hook elementary school. The site where a gunman killed 20 students and 6 teachers. Some say it should be knocked down and replaced with a public memorial. Obstruction became a buzzword during president obama's first term and with the new congress set to return tomorrow, are plans already in place for obstruction 2.0 once president obama is sworn in next week? Msnbc contributor ari melber has an interesting take on that and joins us right now. Want to hear it. 
>> As you said, a week from tomorrow, president obama will deliver that inaugural address, a time to outline a governing philosophy that will guide the next term but this is a little different. Obama faces a gop opposition that's not only opposed to the his governing philosophy, many republicans are increasingly opposed to governing itself. Take a look at the republican actions just recently since obama was re-elected. They pushed thenomy to the edge of the fiscal cliff and they threatened to make the u.S. Go into default or shut down the government if they don't get policy concessions. They fiercely oppose potential picks for obama's cabinet from susan rice, of course, to people who withdrew to people who had strong gop support up until they were affiliated with president obama like chuck hagel and jack w and republica delayed 85% of the planned relief funding for hurricane sandy. That, of course, drew a strong rebuke from republican governor chris christie. This is not politics devoted to a competing vision. This is politics devoted to digs corruption and obstruction, and those recent fights I mentioned don't even include the explosion of minority obstruction in the u.S. Senate. The filibuster has been used against more of obama's legislation than any president in history. The bottom line is that the gop is exploiting what I think is a hole in our democracy. Can you lose ections and still get your way now if you don't care about responsibly governing. Of course, it's hard to get voters to notice this kind of thing, but I believe obama has a big opportunity at the inauguration. He can call for more than just broad patriotism or vague unity. He can call out the amorality of a political party that would rather threaten man made crises than rn, and he advocate for cooperation. I think it's worth a try 

[00:36:17]


>> the majority of republicans in the republican party, are they for this obstructionism that you're describing, or as we have discussed so many different times it really comes down to five or six dozen that are causing all of the issues here in. 
>> That's a great question, and I think the answer, especially to be fair to the entire republican caucus and we don't know and maybe not. In the senate because of the rules they can be used or abused by very few senators to shut down debate and in the house which is an institution that runs on whatever the speaker decides, we won't hear about how many republicans want to work more collaboratively if the speaker continues to look for majority of the majority rules and look for the kind of process that basically doesn't deal with the president, I don't think, in good faith. 
>> I want to bring in the rest of our members of our brain trust today with nia-malika henderson and ari welch. Let's get your take on what ari was just talking about. How is the president playing his part in obstructionism as you look at what he's done so far? Is he playing it the right way? 
>> I think how we've seen the president going into the second term looking for legacy, for one, and I think a legacy will have to be built around bipartisanship, and you saw in the last debate around the fiscal cliff he got bipartisanship first in the senate, breaking the hastert rule in the house. Boehner had a minority of the majority and that passed in the house as well, so I think the republican party is obviously doing some soul searching now. The philosophy of obstructionism got them to where they are now which is losing in 2012, which is a very low rating. I think among most folks out there seeing this as a party that likes to say no too much, not as the party of ideas which was the whole reagan idea of what the republican party should stand for. You'll have republicans more soul searching. Retreats will happen in the coming days, but I think obama is going to call for, when he has this inaugural address, is going to call for a new era of responsibility, and I think republicans will have to decide what that looks like for their party. 

[00:38:26]


>> Matt, this new era, this rethinking, when it comes to the president as well as democrats, since they do come into 2003, riding a wave, if you will, of success, the president winning with a very large margin, should he take advantage of this and play harder ball? Some say that he's already starting to do that from the intimations of what the debt ceiling negotiation will be like? 
>> Well, I think we see already with the chuck hagel nomination, which a lot of democrats don't like, I see that as a way that obama is actually trying to shove a wedge into the many divides that we see right now in the gop. The gop is saying no in part because that's the system of our governance. It's not a hole in our democracy, it's a design, that we're restraining those who want to use government to its maximum capability. However, saying no isn't necessarily popular and you need to say yes to something. Republicans are legitimately divided amongst themselves about what they want to say yes to, so when you nominate someone like hagel, you let republicans fight each other about republican issues, so I think that's how you're going to see the president do it. That said, you can't run the entire country without the house of representatives, so obama is going to have toake compromises. 
>> Ari, I want to move to you on this. You really sort of discussing hopefully a move towards pragmatism, towards the middle, remembering of that collaboration that we did see some bits of towards the end of the fiscal cliff negotiations, but are you losing the good ones, the ones that might work towards this compromise long term, those who are moving away from whatever edge they are on towards the middle? One example, looking forward 2014, jay rockefeller saying he will not run again. That might be an example. Politico points out this. Rockefeller's retirement means it's an opportuni for republicans to pick up a seat meaning it's a rough year for senate democrats overall. What's your thought about this? 
>> Well, there's no doubt that politically rockefeller had above average democratic support in a state that is very favorable to republicans so it's very tough on republicans to do what he did, but to bipartisanship and what neil said, I think the president has to convince the public that bipartisanship is more than getting a few people from both parties in the final vote. We need to talk about a bipart process, right? That goes to the points I was making and the disagreement i have with matt. He's right that the constitution does provide for my fortarian values and processes within the way that the congress works. But we have to look at the broader evolution here, because the numbers show, I think everyone agrees, more legislation held up to a super majority vote than ever before at any other time in history. It's not automatic that that's the way it is. It's that way now and may not be that way forever. The public is going to increasingly look particularly with the economic dysfunction with whether they think that kind of obstruction is good. My argument is it's not. 

[00:41:30]


>> Who might lead that process and the change of that process? We'll discuss that with our brain trust. Stay right here. More on how the gop plans are going forward to regroup after a quick break. rosa chantix. When the doctor told me that I could smoke for the first week... I'm like...Yeah, ok... Little did I know that one week later I wasn't smoking. 
[ Male Announcer ] ALONG WITH SUPPORT, Chantix is proven to help people quit smoking. It reduces the urge to smoke. Some people had changes in behavior, thinking or mood, hostility, agitation, depressed mood and suicidal thoughts or actions while taking or after stopping chantix. If you notice any of these stop taking chantix and call your doctor right away. Tell your doctor about any history of depression or other mental health problems, which could get worse while taking chantix. Don't take chantix if you've had a serious allergic or skin reaction to it. If you develop these stop taking chantix and see your doctor right away as some can be life-threatening. If you have a history of heart or blood vessel problems, tell your doctor if you have new or worse symptoms. Get medical help right away if you have symptoms of a heart attack. Use caution when driving or operating machinery. Common side effects include nausea, trouble sleeping and unusual dreams. It helps to have people around you... They say, you're much bigger than this. And you are. 
[ Male Announcer ] ASK YOUR DOCTOR IF CHANTIX Is right for you. 

[00:44:49]


>>> All right. As we look forward to 2014 and 2016, the question has been made what will the republicans do to remake their party? The pros esof bipartisanship, what can be done to get there? Our brain trust still with us. Ari melber and nia-malika henderson and matt welsh. We left off by asking who might be the brain trust, if you will, that will push for the a new collaborative process in washington, d.C. Which was what ari's essay was about. Who might that be? 
>> You know, that is a very, very hard question. Because, you know, as much as, you know, you have different leaders, you have boehner. You obviously have obama and you have harry reid. In the senate at some point it becomes every man for himself. People looking at the 2014 elections. There are, I believe, 20 democrats that are going to be up for re-election in the senate and 13 I think republicans. At some point people are playing to whatever their states are, to whatever their different counties are, so I think it's very hard to figure out one person who is going to be sort of the clarion voice of bipartisanship. I think we've seen in the different parties a move toward the south in terms of republicans, fewer northeastern republicans, fewer moderate republicans, so that's a real issue so I am sort of at a loss to think about people who will some forward and sort of lead the charge for bipartisanshipship. Maybe people like joe biden who seems to be everybody's favorite democrat these days. 
>> Nia, we were hoping you would give us that clear choice of who will lead the process forward. Who do you think might lead that process that ari is talking about, the idea of more olimpia snowes perhaps? 
>> Well, I mean, you have to keep in mind that the republican party is in year four or five now of a battle for its soul, and there are definite different competing visions out there led by different are personalities who have different comportments and some will cooperate with democrats. Marco rubio will cooperate with democrats and rand paul cooperating on some national defense issues, cutting military spending, some spying issues that we care about. You'll see paul ryan making a big show out of not cooperating with democrats but always voting yes as he did for the fiscal cliff deal and as he has in many times previous so it's going to be opportunistic between them, but they haven't sorted it out, this civil war between lves and it makes it very difficult for a single figure to rally under the republican mantle. 

[00:47:25]


>> Ari, to you, to whatever matt is saying and add to whatever you would like to to the conversation here. We saw tea partiers rel back in 2010 because they did not see the fiscal conservatism that they believe that the republican party should -- should have in its platform. Might you see those centrists, those moderate republicans saying, hey, we're going to lead the republican party and start our own, if you will, subgroup because right now the republican party doesn't represent what we want it to be. 
>> I don't see that kind of splintering, but I would echo things like rubio and potentially even ted cruz bring a different kind of strength to potential compromise. They both have some strong relationships with the tea party, but they also have some issues that they come to and say we can do this, and that's really the question. Can you compromise from a position of strength rather than weakness? There's no doubt that both parties have issues in this current climate where any kind of work across the aisle is seen as disloyal. On the democratic side I would point to senator ron widen who has clearly reached across the aisle on entitlement and spending and who is an organize senator strong on a lot of issues, including civil liberties and health care who is not seen by any kind of democrat a sellout. 
>> We've talked about the process. Talked about who someone might be. Let's talk about the language that people might use and what was written in an article titled why republicans should watch bipartisanship. Using tax code and immigration reform and this is what he said, the gop paid a price for its out-of-touch language in november and could pay again in 2014, just as it did in 2006 unless the party changes course. Congressional republicans must reintroduce themselves to the american people. America is listening, and they want a republican party that listens to them, too. That's what was said here, so what's your thought here, nia? Is it enough for republicans to watch their language, and if so what do they neeo say or do? 

[00:49:43]


>> That's right, and in some ways the most eloquent person to talk about this at least today was colin powell when he talked about the issue of race and gop and what he saw as some of the enflamed code words that gop folks had been using in talking about president obama that might land differently with african-americans than they do with the general public, so it is I think a question about framing, but I also think it's got to be about specificity. The gop, for instance, now taout spending cuts. Are they prepared to say the "m" word? Are they prepared to talk about medicare and are they prepared to talk about social security? So in some ways they are dancing around and being vague about entitlement and spending cuts but have been really loathe to get down to specifics. 
>> Nia, there you go. You had a name there, colin powell. Maybe that's the person you'll add to the list. 
>> Stay with us. Don't go anyway, ari, nia and matt. Still ahead, how will the united states react to vice president joe biden's gun safety recommendations that will be coming out we expect on tuesday. We'll pick it up there when we come back.

>>> I'm going to be submitting to the president my proposal as to how to proceed. I'm shooting for tuesday. I hope I get it done by then. We get it done by then. 
>> There you heard it. The vice president hoping to get it done for tuesday. Let bring back the panel. Our brain trust and their prediction for the day after if he does come out with his recommendations on tuesday and let's start with matt welsh who rejoins us. Matt, what's your thought. What's going to be the headline on wednesday after the recodations come out from the vice president? What's the headline for "reason" magazine? 
>> Biden cracks down on symbolic weaponry. It's a very uncomforter comfortable and not very pleasant thing to grapple with, but a lot of the types of initiatives being discussed right now and that always happen in the wake of shootings are measures that actually wouldn't have affected the shooting in question. That's what we're going to see again in this new package. 
>> Nia, your thought andt's your headline in the "washington post" about that and react to what matt said? 
>> I think it's going to be gun task force suggests far-reaching support for gun control. I think they will try to go big and bold in this. You saw progressives a little upset with what came out with the fiscal cliff deal. This is a president very moved by what happened by sandy hook, as was the rest of the nation, so I think it's going to be very prod in terms of looking at mental health, looking at an assault weapons ban and looking at magazine clips and also some of the loopholes as well, so i think this is going to be big. I think, you know, you have to see down the line if the politicians are in place in the house specifically to get any of this stuff done, but I do think there is some consensus amongst some politicians cross party, cross nra, some of the membership there with some of the things that might come out of this commission's report. 
>> Yeah. That if, underline it and capitalize those two letters if they do have the right amount of support for that bill or any recommendation that comes out. Ari to you finally then. What's the headline that's going to be in the nation? 

[00:55:57]


>> Well, would I say the truth is not that exciting. It's a long road ahead on the response to the shootings, and wherever you come down on how it should be handled, I don't think we'll see all the solutions in the next few months. I think you have to talk about rewiring some of the debates for several years in this country.

>> Announcer: This is "need to know" with jeff greenfield, scott simon, ray suarez and this week maria hinojosa. 
>> On this edition, trying to comprehend the incomprehensible. Making sense of our tax code. Why do some americans benefit much more than others? 
>> This guy makes eight times the amount that you make and he's paying a lower effective tax rate than you. 
>> It's really sort of outrageous that it's happening. And it's reay sort of outrageous that our elected leaders allow it to continue to happen. 
>> The tale of four tax returns. Next on "need to know." 
>> Welcome to "need to know." Thanks for joining us. It's great to be with you. If you take the time to read its mission statement, you'll discover that the irs pledges to apply tax law with "fairness to all." But what americans continue to debate is whether the tax laws themselves are fair. Why, for instance, do one third of all americans get to deduct all sorts of expenses from their tax bill while the other two-thirds end up taking just a single deduction known as the standard deduction? Is that right? Is that fair? And another important question: Do our tax policies boost economic growth or slow it? There is certainly no consensus about any of that in washington. But lawmakers on both sides of the aisle do agree that the current tax code is a complicated mess that needs rethinking and reworking. How complicated is it? Well, we recently convinced four residents of new jersey to share their 2010 tax returns with us and to talk to us about them. What emerged was a vivid picture of how some americans, and not just rich americans benefit from the tax code far more than others. "Need to know's" megan thompson reports. 

[00:03:00]


>> Jennifer rosado works for a local nonprofit in central new jersey. But she earns a low wage, and as a single mother with two young kids, she says it's difficult to make ends meet. 
>> It's hard to struggle throughout a year. It's hard to live paycheck to paycheck. It's hard to say, "i can't get this for my kids right now. Or I can't do this." People don't wanna be there. 
>> About an hour away in north bergen, new jersey, daniel rangel earns a working-class wage as an electrician. He doesn't have kids, but says his budget is still tight. 
>> Obviously I could be doing better. But I'm stretching my dollar. I have some letters -- 
>> in new jersey's state capitol trenton, seth hahn is doing well for himself. He earns an upper middle class income as a senior staffer at a labor union. 
>> I feel pretty comfortable. I feel pretty fortunate in this economy that I have a job. 
>> And in the wealthy suburb of franklin lakes, new jersey, multi-millionaire eric schoenberg sits in one of the highest income brackets. A business professor and entrepreneur, he's wealthy thanks to a large inheritance and a former career on wall street. 
>> My wealth is in the eight figures. 
>> Safe to say that you're one of the 1%? 
>> I would say I'm solidly within the 1% in terms of wealth. 
>> Each year, low-wage earner jennifer rosado, working-class electrician daniel rangel, upper-middle- class seth hahn and multi-millionaire eric schoenberg file four of the approximately 140 million tax returns received by the irs. 
>> Their returns not only look very different because of their wildly different incomes. They also offer a glimpse into the enormously complicated u.S. Tax code, and how certain taxpayers benefit some say unfairly more than others because of a set of very particular and personal circumstances, from having kids, to owning a home, to living in a state with high taxes to the way they earn their money. 

[00:05:10]


>> In 2010, jennifer rosado made just over $12,800, below the poverty line for a family of three, but because she has two kids and earned so little, rosado's taxable income was zero and she actually got a refund of over $6,000 due to tax credits worth far more than what she owed in taxes -- a big break for rosado who once lived in a homeless shelter. 
>> When that income tax money comes back, it's just like I can breathe a little bit. 
>> Rosado says she stretches her $6,000 refund over most of the year to supplement her low wages. 
>> I don't have this money coming in every month. This is a one-time thing throughout the year. So I try to break it down and say, "okay, what months am i struggling the most where it's really getting hard for me? What happens?" So my heat bill goes up in the winter. So I usually put money aside for that. And not have to worry about my heat getting shut off. 
>> Rosado's biggest benefit, more than $5,000 came from what's known as the earned income tax credit. Almost 27 million americans receive this credit each year, but usually only if they worked during the year and their income was low enough. And tax filers with children, like rosado, get more. 
>> Part of what the earned income credit is supposed to do is encourage work. Do you agree with that? Do you think it does encourage work? 
>> It does, yeah. Definitely. 
>> How? 
>> Only because it's earned income. You need to have earned income to receive that credit. 
>> But at the same time, rosado didn't pay any federal income tax. 
>> There are some people in this country who criticize that. They say, "we all get the benefits of tax revenues. We should all pitch in. Should all pay our fair share." What do you say to that? 
>> We gotta look at those people that are literally one paycheck away from being back on the streets. And I've been there. And that's not a good place to be. It's just, it's a security. It's just financial security. 
>> Financial security, a big benefit for rosado, and also a big concern for working-class electrician daniel rangel. 

[00:07:13]


>> But the thing is, especially how times are right now -- with food prices going up and pretty much everything going up, it's getting difficult to make ends meet. 
>> In 2010, rangel made less than $30,000, but he paid $1,380 in tax. So why did he end up on the hook for federal income tax, when low-wage earner jennifer rosado got a $6,000 refund? One big reason is that he has no kids. 
>> We spoke to a single woman, who, like you, lives here in new jersey. She has two kids. So she gets to claim two dependents on her tax return. For the last several years, has paid no federal income tax but she's gotten thousands of dollars back in refund. What do you think about that? 
>> There are special cases where one may need assistance from the government. And we can help out in those instances. I feel for people in her situation. You said she was a single mom. I feel for -- in my -- my mom was a single mom. 
>> Rangel, a navy veteran, says he's sympathetic to low-wage earners like jennifer rosado because he grew up in similar circumstances. He was raised by his mother, an immigrant from cuba in a housing project in new york city. But rangel, who is active with the tea party, says he has philosophical concerns about the federal government redirecting money from the rich to the poor. 
>> The problem that I have with that is that, ultimately, when you really boil down to it, taking the two kids and takin' all of the issues out of it, it's -- what it really is is the redistribution of wealth. And the way I see it, it's -- that's now how america was built. That's not how america operates. 
>> Rangel is also skeptical about whether taxpayer dollars are being well-spent. 
>> But the thing is, we do have to take care of our fellow citizens. You know, we do have to be our brother's keeper. But the thing is, when you have a system as big as the federal government in charge of all these systems, there's gonna be waste. And it's in every, every program, whether it's social, whether it's military. It's across the board. 

[00:09:27]


>> I'll be teaching corporate tax at a tax policy center. 
>> Dorothy brown is a law professor at emory university in atlanta and a progressive tax analyst. 
>> So if there's a low income earner who doesn't have kids, they're gonna see much less of a benefit from these things if -- and maybe no benefit at all. Is that fair? 
>> One of the greatest benefits of the earned income tax credit is the number of children lifted out of poverty as a result of it. So there's an argument that we've got limited dollars to go around. Where do we wanna spend this credit? You wanna spend it with families with children. 
>> The one thing I like a lot about the earned income tax credit is that you only get the earned income tax credit if you work. 
>> Conservative stephen moore is a senior economics writer for the wall street journal and the author of the new book, "who's the fairest of them all?" 
>> One of the problems I have with our spending programs, our welfare programs like food stamps, unemployment insurance, which are, you know, growing tremendously in cost is there's no work requirement. There's nothing, were not asking someone in return to give anything in return to society for getting these benefits. 
>> Those benefits, and low-income earners like jennifer rosado became an issue during last year's presidential campaign when mitt romney made his now-famous comment about "the 47%," a reference to the number of americans who don't pay any federal income tax. 
>> There are 47% who are with him, who are dependent upon government, who believe that they are victims, who believe that government has a responsibility to care for them. 
>> I believe that anybody who is a voter in this country, anybody who is a citizen and anyone who's a worker, should pay some federal income tax. Some. Even if it's just $100. Because I think everybody should have some stake in the system. And when you have, right now, about four out of ten americans who when they fill out their 1040 forms and all of the other forms they pay zero, yea, i think that's a problem. 
>> How is that fair? A lot of people look at that and they say, and they see the fact that half the people in this country aren't paying a federal income tax. And they say, "that's not fair." 

[00:11:33]


>> The notion of low income taxpayers, low income workers not paying taxes does not comport with reality. 
>> In fact, brown says all the focus on tax breaks for the poor obscures a bigger point. These people are paying plenty of other federal taxes, like medicare and social security. Those taxes amounted to nearly $1,000 for low-wage earner jennifer rosado and more than $2,000 for working-class electrician daniel rangel. 
>> Every april 15, newspapers talk about the 47% of taxpayers who don't pay any income taxes. Now, the better stories talk about social security taxes, gas taxes, excise taxes, and the other taxes that low income workers pay. So it's a complicated picture and 47% dependent sound bite is an -- inaccurate picture of it. 
>> But because almost half of all americans pay no income tax, the overall burden falls overwhelmingly on the more affluent. In fact, as conservative stephen moore points out, those making more than about $370,000 -- the top 1% -- pay almost 40% of all federal income tax, and those making more than about $116,000, the top 10%, pay around 70%. 
>> I mean, I think this is important to understand. No matter whether you're a liberal or conservative or republican or democrat we should understand the basic facts of the tax system. And for all the talk about the rich not paying their fair share, I mean the truth is that 1 out of 100 pay 40 cents on every dollar that's raised. That's a pretty progressive tax system. 
>> That may be. But that same group of affluent americans do gain from some of the biggest benefits, which make up the bulk of the nearly $1.1 trillion worth of breaks in the u.S. Tax code. Things like the mortgage interest deduction, worth about $72 billion in 2011, the charitable donation deduction, worth about $34 billion, and the state and local tax deduction, worth about $64 billion. But just as there are major differences in the benefits paid to lower-wage earners there are also huge discrepancies between what theell-off and the very rich pay. In fact, seth hahn, who earns an upper-middle wage as a union staffer actually pays more proportionally in federal income taxes than multimillionaire eric schoenberg. In 2010, hahn earned about $84,000 and paid $14,925 in federal income tax. 

[00:14:13]


>> Okay, do you own a home, or are you a renter? 
>> We rent an apartment right now. 
>> Okay. So there's no mortgage interest deduction that you're taking on your tax returns? 
>> Right, that's correct. 
>> Did you make charitable contributions in 2010 that you could deduct from your taxes? 
>> If I did, I didn't deduct anything on my taxes. 
>> How about state and local taxes? 
>> I did just the standard deduction in 2010 and didn't deduct any state or local taxes. 
>> There are lots of deductions that were not available to me in 2010. 
>> For someone who has an income in the middle, who's single, no kids, rents, what does the tax code do for that person? 
>> The tax code, I would say, comes for that person early and often. And that person should want tax reform that gets our rates lowered. Two-thirds of americans do not itemize deductions. So we don't care what deductions and loopholes there are because we use the standard deduction. 
>> So two-thirds of americans can't or don't take advantage of these deductions. 
>> Correct. 
>> Who is this one-third of americans who can? 
>> In general, the higher income, the more likely you are to itemize and the more likely you are to get significant benefits out of itemized deductions. 
>> Higher income taxpayers, like eric schoenberg. 
>> I do take a substantial total number of deductions. 
>> In 2010, schoenberg earned nearly $725,000. But just going by the book, he was able to deduct more than $160,000. This included more than $42,000 for new jersey's high state and local taxes, and almost $68,000 in gifts to charity. Schoenberg has paid off his house, but for many years took a deduction for interest paid on his mortgage. 
>> Schoenberg's tax return is not unique. In fact, affluent taxpayers receive the vast majority of the benefits from deductions. In 2011, the overwhelming percentage of gains from the mortgage interest deduction, the charitable donation deduction and the state and local tax deduction all went to taxpayers making more than $100,000 a year. 

[00:16:26]


>> Those that earn the highest income get the most benefit from tax deductions. And those that earn the lowest incomes or lower income amounts get the least benefit, so it's upside down. 
>> But one of schoenberg's biggest breaks didn't come from any deduction. It came from how earned his money. 
>> In 2010, of that $724,000, about $51,000 was from wages and salaries. So this would've been earnings from my teaching. 
>> Wages and salaries were subject to income tax rates that, until this month, topped out at 35%. 
>> The single biggest category, which is typically the case for me, was capital gains. I had $404,000 in capital gains in 2010. Do you think you're going to be happier if you become rich? 
>> That capital gains income was taxed at a much lower rate of 15%. And because investment income, not wages from a job, made up the bulk of schoenberg's earnings, his effective tax rate -- the overall percentage in taxes he paid was only 15.9%. But remember seth hahn, who earned all his $84,000 from his job. He paid an effective tax rate of 17.7%. 
>> This guy makes eight times the amount that you make, and he's paying a lower effective tax rate than you. What do you think about that? 
>> It -- it's really sort of outrageous that it's happening. And it's really sort of outrageous that our elected leaders allow it to continue to happen. The people who are reaping all of the benefits of the wealth that we are sort of collectively creating are those who are paying, often, the least in taxes. And I think that's a really unfair way of going about doing things. 
>> And remember those social security taxes? They just went up by 2%. Low-income earner jennifer rosado, working-class daniel rangel and upper-middle- class seth hahn pay them on everything they earn at their jobs. And while multi-millionaire eric schoenberg also pays them on the income he makes from his teaching, the hundreds of thousands of dollars he earns from his investments aren't subject to any of those taxes. 

[00:18:39]


>> We have two tax systems in america. One is progressive and I say that applies to most of us who are wage earners. And one is a flat rate which is a 15% tax on income from stock and dividends, a capital gains tax rate. If the richest among us pay the lowest tax rates, something's wrong with this picture. 
>> As part of the fiscal cliff deal earlier this month, taxes on investment income, lowered under president george w. Bush to 15% in 2003, were raised to 20% for upper-income households. A new 3.8% tax on investments will also kick in this year for high earners, because of the affordable care act. But conservative stephen moore believes this is the wrong answer. 
>> One of the problems that i have with our current tax system is that we actually tax the kind of behavior that we want. We want people to save, we want people to invest in new companies and new equipment and to hire workers and I think we have a punitive system when it comes to that kind of virtuous behavior that creates growth. 
>> So some people argue that if you raise rates on investment income you're gonna disincentivize savings and investment and capital formation. What do you say? 
>> I say okay, we tried it your way, bush tax cuts, lowest capital gains rate ever. Where are the jobs? Where's the investment? Where's the capital? It hasn't worked out, so now let's try something different. 
>> In fact, the country is about to try something different. Under the deal struck earlier this month, tax deductions and credits will be limited for those earning at least $250,000 a year. And tax rates will rise on income above $400,000 a year. 
>> I think it's a really bad idea right now to be raising marginal tax rates, especially at the people at the top. Because you have to understand, what do those people do. Those people in the top 2% or 3% that the president talks about those are the people who create the jobs. 
>> Daniel rangel, who eaed a working class wage of less than $30,000 isn't affected by any of this. But as a member of the tea party he also doesn't want to see taxes go up on the wealthy. 

[00:20:48]


>> Once you go down the road where you gonna raise the tax rate on the higher income, i feel that you take the incentive of a person becoming a part of that tax bracket -- becoming rich. And because there's, there's nothing wrong with the capitalist system. If you continue to only attack the rich only to try to redistribute the wealth from the rich, there's not enough rich people in the world in order to redistribute the wealth to everybody else, so everybody's equal. It's just -- you know, it's simple math. 
>> But surprisingly, millionaire eric schoenberg doesn't see it that way. He's become something of a tax activist, which is why he shared such personal financial information with us. 
>> I think it's perfectly reasonable that the wealthy, who I believe, in the end, benefit the most from having a society that works for everybody, should be contributing more. 
>> So you think that you should pay more in taxes. 
>> I absolutely think I should pay more in taxes. 
>> Even though you paid $115,000 in taxes in 2010. 
>> Well, if you added up what I've paid in taxes over the years, it would be a lot more than that. 
>> Even still, you would like to pay more. 
>> I would. "Why should we have these differential rates between earnings from income and earnings from capital?" It's, it's the -- the hardworking individual who goes out to get money for their labor that we really ought to be rewarding. Isn't that the person that we really feel is contributing the most to society? You know, why is it that we think what the venture capitalist does is more important than what the teacher does? 
>> Although schoenberg's income varies widely from year to year, it's unlikely that many of the changes from this month's deal will dramatically affect him. They won't affect seth hahn either, but he did get married last year and that could lead to new deductions down the road. 
>> You're doing well for yourself, and you may someday want to buy a house or have a child. Are any of the deductions incentives for you to do any of those things? 

[00:22:57]


>> I -- we will probably make decisions about whether or not to have children independent of the tax write-off. And, you know, we will look at -- buying a home when it's right for us and our career. And, honestly, the tax write-off discussion has not even entered into it. 
>> As for jennifer rosado, she went back to school and took a second job. And this once homeless woman's income has soared from $12,800 in 2010 to around $35,000 today. She believes getting the earned income tax credit helped her get back on her feet. 
>> Hey everybody! 
>> Nowadays, rosado works with a team to provide free tax preparation for low-income earners in central new jersey, trying to get the word out about benefits available to them, like the earned income tax credit. 
>> If you don't know about it, you need to get it, if you haven't gotten it, you're able to go back up three years and receit. And it's worth it. It's definitely worth it. 
>> This week online, take part in our weekly poll. The topic -- who wins when it comes to taxes? And don't know your capital gains from your earned income tax credit? Use "need to know's" tax glossary. Visit pbs.Org/needtoknow. 
>> That's it for this edition of "need to know." On our next edition, solving the paralysis that grips washington, d.C. 47 different permits from 19 different government entities. All of these requirements can't be avoided because the law requires you to go through these studies and requirements even if they have no possible impact. 

[00:25:17]


>> Jeff greenfield will be with you then. I'm maria hinojosa. Thanks so much for watching.

>> Hi, I'm bob. United water believes that all citizens need to be informed about the important issues that affect their daily lives. That is what we are proud to support programming and partners in public television. 
>> Funding for new jersey capitol report has been provided by -- the health care foundation of new jersey. Founded by the jewish community. New jersey manufacturers insurance group. Auto insurance, homeowners' insurance, and baking under the principle of stewardship. Wells fargo. Forward thinking. The law firm of gibbons. And by advantage insurance co. Of new jersey. 
>> Welcome to new jersey capitol report. I am rafael pi roman. 
>> I am steve adubato. Good to see senator. 
>> Are you guys doing all right? 
>> We're doing it one month after hurricane sandy and the thanksgiving season. Senator, the biggest issue is what your district faced in the westfield area. Citizens of new jersey face from your perspective and what, double question, are looking for from legislative and leaders? 

[00:02:05]


>> Of course, in the last several weeks, people saw the devastation to their friends and neighbors. I know we saw it in westfield. Westfield, my home town to walk the dog. Was pouring down rain. It was the undersigned of a true tree that had fallen down. I walked two houses up and the neighbor yelled out, be careful. The wires are down. That was in towns across new jersey. And then you had the devastation down in the short. I think what we saw in the course of the entirety of the process, in a lot of ways we learned a lot of lessons from i read and everything else in the last couple of years. The governor was very affective in implementing some of those. We saw what government can do, but also what neighbor helping neighbor can do. People were staged in people's homes. People cannot and said, how can I help? Hamas supporters you could do as a leader, and the government did very effectively, is provide the information. Point of the resources you can point at work with your partners on a bi-partisan basis. Keep people informed and allow some predictability to be put in their lives. I think chris christie and the administration did a great job. 
>> Even when you cannot solve all the problems, which could not be done, communication was key. 
>> Communication was key. The mayor in westfield hosted not one but two town-wide calls where people could call and. 
>> The producers were in on those calls. 
>> It was amazing. 
>> We had the board of public utilities. We have the schools because schools were closed for two weeks. We had the board of education there. He said very clearly, if your kids were -- this morning, you are the parent. Is is your problem. If -- it is my problem as the board of education. 

[00:04:20]


>> To drive all that? 
>> Know. It was eddy's idea. He is the only mayor that I know of who did this. They participated in the call, but we provided two times the update. There will do another instance in another town, they could say, this is the answer. This is the question. We have been putting information to it. I think what people are looking for is, the picture the resources are there. But sure the governor did and people all across the country came in to help. Make sure you have access to fuel and water and how this impacts people's lives. 
>> And clearly, the work the governor has done has been, by all accounts, praise-worthy. But how far did his communication go when people continue to fill the devastation of sandy? As steve said, we are shooting this for weeks afterwards. He was here and he spoke to us. I mean, people are devastated and devastation inever going to end. They're not bored to come back the way they were. 
>> The landmarks are not going to be, in many instances, we remember. 
>> And their homes. 
>> The homes in the central part of the states have a huge win the damage. There is not as much water damage. People are still not allowed in their homes. We're about to do a taping now of a hearing -- we're going to do a series of hearings across the state. Say, what can we do to change? What changes are necessary? We anticipate that the people who are calling to show up are not only going to be people who will testify throughout the country and the region, but people who do not have homes and are not allowed back in their homes. They still have major issues. When you are out from your home and your kids are displaced from the school, that sense of displacement is very real for people. What we need to continue to focus on is not only harming our assets, we to make sure the generators and the swes for utilities are higher and protected. Make sure people know which gas stations have fuel and switch the generators around. Make sure coming through the process and through the pipeline and the port it can be sent in, on interrupted -- uninterrupted. Working with fema and getting the right answers. 

[00:07:21]


>> Real quick. A philosophical and practical question. For many who say we need less government, how you change your view -- have you changed your view at all? 
>> No. 
>> Have you change your view at all when you see if the month, when she the department of defense and transportation, and the sea governor christie getting those folks together with president obama, have you changed your view at all about the role government? 
>> No. Weakened first aided and roosevelt and others in bipartisan tradition, government is there to do things that people can do on their own perry to provide the opportunities for people to get an equal start. So those areas for the cannot compete on their own, that is where the role of government comes in. 
>> Crisis and emergency. 
>> This is an area where we need to have those real areas of focus. They're supposed to come into new jersey just like they were supposed to come into louisiana. What we as republicans care about is a efficient government. There is a lot of wasted government. The department of defense, those areas we care passionately about. 
>> Let me ask you a question on the budget. The governor now seems to be saying that the tax cuts that he has been pushing, that he will put on the back burner as a result of a sandy. Conservatives say, it is moments like this that we need that kind of stimulus. What do you say? 
>> A couple of things people do not realize. There are people who will say, what am I paying my fourth quarter property taxes when it did have a home to pay property taxes on? That is going to impact people locally. Schools, when the have to bus their children to different school districts because their schools are no longer operating, that will be a cost to government. I think the governor is focusing on, he is very clear, we need stronger, smaller government. Lower tax rates, including income taxes, but let's figure with the devastation is. We have time between now and mid-to-late january. 

[00:09:48]


>> Senator, thank you for joining us. 
>> Thank you. 
>> In a moment, a conversation with the mayors of two towns that were hit hardest by hurricane center. Thank you, senator. 
>> Many people throughout the state have been devastated by hurricane sandy. He would like to make a difference, you can show your support to the hurricane center in new jersey relief fund. Is it their website at sandynjrelieffund.Org. 
>> Joining us, kennedy o'brien and ed johnson. Mayor johnson, the situation at asbury park? 
>> It took a serious blow under hurricane sandy. While things are serious in asbury park, they are not as bad as we have seemed region-wide. It's pavilion's took a heavy blow and we have heavy tree damage throughout the town. For us, the electricity coming back sort of turned us towards recove versus the complete devaation you see in other places. O'brien, the biggest impact to date? 
>> We lost -- we had a 14-foot wall of water come through our town. It took out a complete neighborhoods. It knocked out the foundations made among in habitable -- the gas lines, the water lines, submerged everything. We were pulling people out of the second-floor windows with boats. 
>> Which of these people doing now? 
>> They are displaced. 
>> We are doing this program during the thanksgiving season. We may even repeated because the issues we will be discussing, unfortunately, will be just as relevant. The issues are not going away. We will be working with them on the governor and the federal government. Let me ask you, long-term, what will be impacted your community? 

[00:12:07]


>> Adobe a far-reaching impact. A lot of our businesses -- it will be a far-reaching impact. Without electricity, we had a town with 16,000 people closed. Yet the economic impact of businesses that were closed. And these are mom and a pot of businesses. These are not macy's-kind of businesses. You have that economic impact. Yet to start rebuilding our for our, our beach area, and our pavilions. 
>> Will you? 
>> Absolutely. 
>> Will you do that in spite of the storm, in spite of the possibility of a storm like this again? Ortiz step back and say, time out? Maybe we should not back >> no, we are rebuilding. Some of the businesses will come on line next week. Asbury park will be back. We anticipate that by may of this year. 
>> Talk about the long-term impacts of your community. 
>> You'll see a radical, a downward shift for the working middle class. In our area, in the neighborhoods we lost, we had people where this was their third catastrophic storm in the last 32 months. Each one grew in strength and the damage. This being the most damaging and the worst of the three. That being said, everyone affected, these are working people. Working middle class. These are people who pay their bills, cut their grass, coach soccer, cheerleading, go to work every day. Basically, white-out -- wiped out.; there is practically nothing to help them. There are homes in repetitive flood zones. That being said, the annual funding for blue acres as $12 million. We look at the magnitude of the destruction in our state, it is insufficient. I believe that a whole new out of the box thinking will be required. The first thing they'll have to do is come in and have a forbearance on mortgage payments. When they go to rent an apartment for temporary shelter, they fill up the credit application. It shows they are a homeowner. Let's say their payments $1,200 or $800 and the apartment is $1,200, the landlord says, who are you going to papers? The bank or myself? The first thing that happens, any bank that holds a market with these people state-wide -- 

[00:15:27]


>> is that a similar issue for u.S. Well? 
>> Absolutely. 
>> It is it the government? It is not a bank unless they voluntarily choose to do that. 
>> You have a feeling that offers both business and personal loans. Through their institutions, they make that determination. I want to take a step back even further than what the mayor was talking about. We have a large group of people who are living paycheck to paycheck to begin with. Just to make the normal mortgage payments in a normal situation every day was difficult enough. But to have to immediately come up with first month, last month deposits, those kinds of things that we all take for granted or had taken for granted is really impossible. 
>> Mayor johnson, it is all that they lost everything, many of these people lost their jobs as well. 
>> That was where the revenue was coming from. You are making it clear, there is no government program set up with enough dollars to make up that difference. If the government does not step in and get the banks to say -- on the mortgage payment, what will happen? 
>> You have a mass -- you have people who walk away. The have no choice. The loan is a loan. If you a note to $1,000 on a $350,000 home -- if you vote $200,000 on a primitive thousand dollar home and you're in a repetitive flood some, it is a terrible situation to be in. MY UNDERSTANDING IS THE wOVERNOR Has issued an executive order. If it is a 90-day forbearance, in my opinion the needed 24 to 46 months of forbearance. You got to stop the clock. You cannot go against their credit. With a critical shortage of rental property. 30 seconds left. You agree? 

[00:17:37]


>> Absolutely. We certainly have to look at the long-term care of these individuals that need shelter and need to create new life. We also have to look at the system in terms of immediate needs. We have a emergency shelter where they spend the night. But after three weeks, two months, the transition into the possibility of even finding additional housing, we have to look at this program from start to finish. 
>> We will continue to talk to the mayor's who are struggling. 
>> We would like to bring you back. 
>> Absolutely. Mayor johnson from asbury park, mayor o'brien from steve adubato -- from sayreville. 
>> Stay with us. 
>> If you would like more information on this program or should like to express an opinion, e-mail us. Visit us online. Or find us on a facebook. 
>> We are joined our good friend and colleague, philip kirschner. Good to see you. 
>> Thank you. 
>> We're doing this program around the holidays. Offshore fish -- attitude is? 
>> It is still up. We just released a survey. Confidence is up. Peoplehink the state is heading in the right direction. It was very encouraging para >> we need to talk about the affect of sandy on businesses in a moment. What you think is making that confidence rise? 
>> A couple things. We measured their actual results in 2012. On the ground, it has been improved sales from the year before. More projects in the pipeline. That spurs confidence that we have grown from 2010 to 2011. Two dozen 13 will grow -- will turn the corner. For businesses, they look at the number of jobs created. They cannot control how many people are looking for those jobs. It is the number of jobs created. The number of jobs created are actually back to where they were pre-recession, about 25,000 to 30,000 per year. 

[00:20:28]


>> Are there rid of the national scene? The fiscal cliff? Raising of ta? 
>> They are, but that is what made the service so encouraging. It is across the board. It was love this surprise but the fiscal cliff. Also, anxious to know going in. But despite that, their projections for revenue sales and even ment is up. 
>> How much of the confidence of your members? By the way, you will see the website. For the magazine, the new jersey businesses association. We have a partnership with new jersey businesses as well. You can go on and find out a whole range of information. How much of this confidence has to do with the relationship between governor christie and the business community? 
>> I think that also has a great deal to do with it. 
>> Describe the relationship. 
>> It is very good. The agenda in terms of regulatory reform and the taxes and controlling government spending. It really matches our agenda very well. I think you see that. The governor has unprecedented ratings of 73% approval ratings. That is a third year in a row from our members. It is like a much better than that. 
>> Being the governor and not the emperor, he has a legislature, both houses controlled by the democrats would often have a different policy. What impact does that have? 
>> In another would agree with that totally. I think what we have seen from the members is that on all the issues that I mentioned, both for bipartisan achievements. 

[00:22:31]


>> Regulatory reform? 
>> Very much so. The red tape review commission. 
>> It looks like there is a rise in minimum wage looming in the state. 
>> As we do this program, the minimum age -- the minimum wage bill has passed the assembly. We do not know what will happen. But you get said no to that. The democrats are saying yes. 
>> That is a difference of opinion. Prior to that, and the one of the things that distinguished new jersey from washington is when there's a bipartisan issue, whether it was controlling spending, tax, tax reform or early in the term, people were able to put aside their partisan differences and work for the best interests of the economy. 
>> Are you willing to accept a compromise on the rise of minimum wage? 
>> Is a tough issue. It is a bad issue for business anyway. You are looking at raising the wages of people who work in this seasonal industries anyway and the kinds of businesses that were particularly hit hard by sandy. The timing makes no sense whatsoever. 
>> But this has been in the works for a while. 
>> It has been in the works for a while. The feeling was that we are, perhaps, turning the corner of the recovery. We are still not back to where we were five years ago. 
>> We have about one minute and a half left. I want to know what you're thinking is on the overall of fact of a sandy on the business community in new jersey. 
>> Obviously there were a large number of businesses impacted. Some of those will be impacted for the long term. The good news is that the overwhelming majority of businesses are back up. Most of their customers are back up and running. I think we will see may be a negative impact for sandy in november. Looking in the longer-term, i mean 2013, this is for most businesses, a very bad about short-term of vent. 

[00:24:50]


>> Short-term? 
>> Short-term in terms of their businesses in most of the state. We will have more of an impact. But for the majority of the state, it will be a matter of continued recovery. Remember, we just had I read one uriko. At that time, that was unprecedented. It really did not have a long- term economic impact. 
>> Going into 2013, optimistic? 
>> Optimistic and encouraged.

[00:05:34]


>> Thom: The atlanta falcons hosting this divisional round playoff game. They have been so dominant here at home over the last five years under head coach mike smith. Already the winningest head coach in falcons history. They have won 33 of the 40 games they have played here at home. Pete carroll, 61 years young, grew up in san francisco. In his third year and has turned around a veteran roster into the second youngest team in the league. He was forced to bring in a new kicker this week after the injury to steven hauschka. Ryan longwell, the long-time packer, puts a foot on it and we're under way. Jacquizz rodgers two yards out of the end zone and he is trimmed up at the 25 as atlanta won the toss and elected to receive. They are led by the number one pick back in 2008, matt ryan, and plenty of weapons all around him. 
>> Brian: Boy, do they. Roddy white and julio jones have better than 2100 yards on the year. Future hall of famer tony gonzalez and jacquizz rodgers may end up being the lead back in today's running attack. 
>> Thom: Matt ryan had his best season in the nfl, but today faces one of the most rugged defenses he has encountered all year long. Going up top and beautifully defended by richard sherman, one of the two big, tall, strong cornerbacks in this number one scoring defense. 
>> Brian: Well, they're without defensive end chris clemons and that's going to hurt. Kam chancellor may get the duty of trying to cover tony gonzalez. Earl thomas holds the back end together. But richard sherman leads this team in interceptions with eight. 
>> Thom: Sherman step for step there with julio jones. Second down and ten. Turner, strong running. All the way up to the 40 yard line. That is a 15-yard run by turner, who has really been slowed down as the season has gone on. 

[00:07:52]


>> Brian: Yeah, but pete carroll told us I'm not buying into that. Michael turner is a load. If he gets into the second level, that's where some of those secondary guys start to make those business decisions and wait for somebody else to tackle him. 
>> Thom: Well put. Turner wants more. Cuts it back to the inside, and this time no roochlt -- room. Met by the rookie, bobby wagner. So much talk about the rookie quarterback, russell wilson, bobby wagner, a second round pick out of utah state, set an all-time seahawks rookie record with 140 tackles on the year. 
>> Brian: This is a lot to put on a rookie. But I tell you what, this entire team that pete carroll has put together, he has great confidence in his young players to step up to the task. 
>> Thom: Jacquizz rodgers checks into the backfield. Wide open, tony gonzalez. 200 consecutive games with a reception, including a playoff. Of course the postseason for gonzalez, he's played in five of these games and never come away with a win. 
>> Brian: Everybody talks about with these big corners of seattle, okay, you can handle julio jones, you can handle roddy white. The question becomes what do you do with tony gonzalez? What do you do with harry douglas? What about jacquizz rodgers coming out of the backfield? This is a lot of weapons this atlanta offense has to throw at you. 
>> Thom: Douglas in motion, and they pitch it to rodgers. That will be a gain of close to nine. Everybody talks about atlanta throwing the football a lot, brian. While michael turner individually did not have the kind of numbers he's had since coming here from san diego, as a team they still ran for better than 1200 yards. 

[00:10:03]


>> Brian: Yeah, THEYth IN THE League in rushing. They haven't run the ball real well but that doesn't mean they're not committed to it, that's the important thing. Mike smith will make sure they keep the right balance, although their strength clearly is in the passing game. 
>> Thom: Rodgers wants more, takes the pitch, cuts it back to the inside and is denied first down yardage. So the falcons face a third down. Big red bryant, the defensive team captain of the seattle seahawks, there to make the tackle. 
>> Brian: Third downs is obviously going to be the key. Atlanta is second in the league in third down conversion. More importantly, the atlanta defense is last in the league in third and ten. If matt ryan can steal a couple possessions, meaning extending the drive on third down, it could be key in winning the game today. 
>> Thom: Jason snelling, 44, checks into the backfield for the first time. You get a look at gonzalez. Fake the run, ryan rolling and that is a catch by roddy white for a first down. 
>> Brian: This route by roddy white, this is their wheelhouse. This comeback route between roddy white and matt ryan, i promise you, that ball was on the way before roddy white even made his break. They make a living off this. They think and see things the same way. 
>> Thom: Atlanta has been so good on its opening possession over the course of this season. They scored more touchdowns and scored more points than any team in the nfl. Rodgers slips through a couple of tacklers, he's to the 22. The seattle team, you may remember in the win over washington last week, it did not start well. The redskins first two drives leading to touchdowns, 80 yards, 54 yards. But man, they clamped down there after. 

[00:12:05]


>> Brian: We talked about confidence in this game. One thing pete carroll knows, his team is not going to blink. We've been there, we've stood at the abyss and come back away. We were down 14-0 on the road. Yeah, we don't want to give them a score here, but if we do, we're not going to panic. 
>> Thom: Second down and five. Turner looking for a cut back. There's just no room there. 
>> Brian: Thom, we're in that territory now, we talked about the big, physical corners of the seattle seahawks. And there are none bigger. These guys are all 6'2", 6'3", but this may be the biggest receiving corps they have faced so far this year. Julio jones, roddy white on the outside, down here we may see them challenge the bump and run of the seattle seahawks and take a shot into the end zone. 
>> Thom: Third and three, tenth play of the drive. Pump fake twice, and batted down. How about the play by sherman? Closing speed in the end zone. Maybe a hair late on the throw. 
>> Brian: It was. Roddy white had this beat with a little stutter move, but matt ryan, because of the play fake, got pushed around the pocket and the ball was just late enough for the very tall, the very athletic and the very confident richard sherman to close the distance and knock it down. 
>> Thom: Matt ryan 33 of 38 in the regular season. He only missed once inside this georgia dome inside of 40. Good snap, good hold, and the falcons come away with points on their opening drive. ] traveler who can withstand the perils of air travel? Can you survive change fees? Blackout dates?

>> Brian: Wide receiver coach is explaining to roddy white why the ball was late. He was showing that matt ryan after a double fake had to step away from a rush on the outside, had to pump it and why the ball was late.

[00:18:30]


>> Thom: One of the great stops here in atlanta if you're ever in town, go by the georgia aquarium. On first down, marshawn lynch looking for running room and not much there. John abraham slowed him down, forcing him back to the inside. Lynch rushed for nearly 1600 yards. 
>> Brian: John abraham, setting that edge. That's going to be so important in today's game. Force marshawn lynch back into the teeth of the atlanta falcon defense. 
>> Thom: Rookie quarterback russell wilson puts it in the hands once more of lynch. And met at the line of scrimmage by the duo of akeem denting and stephen nicholas. A third down and long right from the get-go. 
>> Brian: Well, for seattle, you've got to begin with pro bowl left tackle russell okung. Obviously marshawn lynch better than 1500 yards. Zach miller, watch for him on third down. He was a big factor in the washington win and ryan longwell, tom, you already talked about it, he's here because of the 16 years experience. 
>> Thom: Great protection. The throw is high, and it's three and out. Only three plays, but a very impressive start for atlanta. Especially being able to bottle up lynch on back-to-back carries. Harry douglas standing back at his own 30 yard line, and a flag. And already jawing going on. 

[00:20:50]


>> Referee: Numr 64 offense, five-yard penalty. 
>> Thom: We saw a lot of talking early throughout the entire day, the seahawks last week. And right from the start, jermaine kearse and dominique franks giving it to each other. 
>> Brian: They weren't natural rivals. Itunusually chippy for two teams new to each other. I expect to see the same thing today. 
>> Thom: Short punt, and a poor punt by ryan. Great field position for matt ryan and the falcons looking to build on a 3-0 lead. This ball will be spotted at the 50 to the dismay of pete carroll. Only a 30-yard punt. ] cool if we took the already great sentra apart and completely reimagined it? ...With best-in-class combined mpg...

>> Thom: Brian billick, laura okmin, chris myers, I'm thom brennaman. Our entire crew watching as zach miller, starting tight end who had a couple of big receptions last week in a win over washington, heads for the seahawks locker room. Turner, already his fourth carry of the game, and he picks up maybe two. 
>> Brian: That could be huge for seattle if zach miller doesn't return, thom. We talked about how important he was in the third down package. Two big conversions last week against washington. Once they had gotten down 14-0 to allow them to fight their way back, he would be a big loss for them. 
>> Thom: Fake the pitch, come back the other way to julio jones. And he's a couple of yards shy of the first down. Julio jones on his way to his first pro bowl in this his second year out of alabama. They traded up to get him, and certainly a chance to become one of the great receivers in the nfl in the not-too-distant future. 
>> Brian: They felt like he was that last missing piece for matt ryan. When you take a franchise quarterback with the third overall pick like matt ryan, you've got to surround him with people. They felt what they paid was well worth it to go get a julio jones, and so far they have been right. 
>> Thom: Third and three. Bunch formation at the top of your screen. Blitz coming, ryan gets it away and it's intercepted! Bobby wagner at the 32 yard line, and after getting great field position after a poor punt, ryan turns it over. call. She said, "I haven't done my taxes for a few years." What's a few? She said, "I think it's eight." She showed up with four file boxes of paperwork. "Here, take my stuff and figure it out." I will do that for you. It's a mental challenge. It's a puzzle.

>> Thom: A turnover by matt ryan into the waiting arms of the rookie, bobby wagner. He had three interceptions during the regular season. Second possession for seattle. They begin from the 33. Play fake, batted down. Weatherspoon. 
>> Brian: Let's go back to the interception. You're going to see guy and trufant come off the edge. That tells matt ryan I've got man coverage here. But then at the very top tony gonzalez hesitates a little bit. I think it threw matt ryan off and he got out in front of him. That allowed bobby wagner to step into the interception. 
>> Thom: Zach miller injured his foot. His return questionable. anthony McCoy, his backup for the game, at tight end. Play fake once more. All day to throw for wilson. Still looking around, and now he'll take off and nothing but pay dirt. A first down to midfield. 
>> Brian: This is the ultimate in coverage sack. Obviously they have got it pinned off. They can't find the underneath receiver. The tight end wil release, he's taken care of by weatherspoon. Back on the strong side they bottle up the two-man combination. How many times did we see this last night with colin kaepernick with no place to go taking off for a big gain. 
>> Thom:17-yard pickup by wilson. Lynch escapes one tackle and he's inside the 40. Ball is loose! Atlanta has recovered. That was the initial signal given by the first official. Now a second official gets it corrected, turns the other way as well. Lynch, who had the fumble at the 2 yard line in washington last week, coughs it up in atlanta territory here. ??????

>> Thom: Second straight playoff game fumble for marshawn lynch. Now ryan, perfect throw. And the catch by julio jones to the seattle 48 yard line. 
>> Brian: Thom, i talked about the swarming defense of the atlanta falcons. Look how many red jerseys are around this. Sean weatherspoon creating the fumble and then it looks like babineaux jumped on it. But look at all these red jerseys. This is how they live. They have got to get more people on the point of attack, because they are undersized. Mike nolan, defensive coordinator, doing a great job. 

[00:32:22]


>> Thom: Ryan looking for the home run ball for roddy white. And it's incomplete. Once more, that's richard sherman. Tied for the second most interceptions in the nfl with eight. Sherman, an alternate to the pro bowl, and many feel had he not been suspended for testing positive on a drug test -- he, of course, appealed that decision, it was overturned, but many feel like had that not occurred, he would be in the pro bowl. 
>> Brian: He's playing at elite levels. He and browner together may be the two biggest corners in the league. 
>> Thom: Turner. He's brought down behind by wagner, and that will be a horse collar. On bobby wagner. 
>> Referee: Personal foul, horse collar tackle, number 54 of the defense. 15 yards from the end of the run, first down. 
>> Thom: That will take it down to the 30. 
>> Brian: This is so tough when you're trying to bring down a big back like michael turner. Wagner here just grabbing on to anything he can. Unfortunately, you can't get your hand in behind the shoulder pads of a ball carrier. Big penalty that now automatically puts them at the very least in field goal position. 
>> Thom: And actually inside the 30 at the 29 yard line, first down for the falcons. Closing in on 5:00 to play in this opening quarter, and atlanta trying to build on a 3-0 lead. Rodgers with nowhere to go. Let's go down tont field to laura okmin. 
>> Laura: Brian, you and I talked all week about the big test for matt ryan after he threw his first interception. After he did would that playoff history come into his mind. The first thing he did was break up a confrontation between roddy white and the receiver coach who had to literally be pulled away from each other. Calmed roddy down, told him to get back to calming himself down and do his job. We see what he's doing on the field, he was leading the guys off of it. 

[00:34:50]


>> Thom: Second down and nine. Trying to fit it in to julio jones, but k.J. Wright had him blanketed from behind. Matt ryan, talk about three playoff appearances, three losses, has not thrown for 200 yards in any of the three games. Just three touchdowns and now five interceptions. And of course those are nowhere near the numbers he has during the regular year. 
>> Brian: And laura is exactly right. Matt ryan has been at this long enough to know I've got to focus on the task at hand. The big test was what am I going to do after I throw a pick? It doesn't hurt that the defense gets it right back for you by causing a fumble. 
>> Thom: They get it off. Penalty flag will whistle it before it ever gets started. 
>> Referee: False start, number 66 offense. Five-yard penalty. Still third down. 
>> Tt coleman, our referee. You talk about a team that frequently makes mistakes like that. Smart teams, disciplined teams win a lot of games. Atlanta this year set a record for the fewest penalties in a season and the fewest penalty yards in a season by any team. 
>> Brian: And in doing so, they kept themsves out of THESE THIRD AND 14s That they're facing right now because they have not backed themselves up with that type of thing. 
>> Thom: All day to throw it. And that's roddy white. And he appears to have enough for a first down. 16 yards for roddy white. 
>> Brian: You can see roddy white scraping to get to the inside. One way to stay away from these big corners outside, go into the middle of the field where now winston guy and marcus trufant aren't quite as big as browner and sherman have to match up with the talented, athletic and big roddy white. 

[00:37:02]


>> Thom: First down play, ryan looking to the end zone. And it is a catch at the 1 yard line by chase coffman. There is a penalty flag down. Coffman caught one pass during the regular season, one. 
>> Referee: Holding, number 25 on the defense. The penalty is declined. The play results in a first down. 
>> Brian: First off, what a phenomenal catch and throw for coffman and matt ryan. Those are the type of throws you expect seen thrown to tony gonzalez. He doesn't have a lot of practice with coffman throwing it just that area. Looks like he's got control, the foot scrapes. I think that's a good catch. 
>> Thom: Clearly both feet inbounds when coffman made the catch. First and goal from the 1. Ryan to tony gonzalez for the touchdown. 
>> Brian: Right on the end line. What a magnificent throw and catch. Right foot down, left foot down. The future hall of famer has got yet another touchdown on his resume. 
>> Thom: Gonzalez said they beginning of the year that he was 95% sure that he was going to hang it up at the ending of this year. Mike smith told us he's clinging to that other 5%. 
>> Brian: Hey, at least it's not 100%. I'd hold on to it. 
>> Thom: Point after by bryant is good. 10-0 atlanta in the opening quarter of this divisional round playoff with a trip to the nfc championship game on the line. 

[00:39:43]


>> Thom: After the fumble by lynch, eight plays, 61 yards. Gonzalez a one-yard touchdown reception. Seattle fell behind 14-0 last week in washington. They trail 10-0 in atlanta in round two. 
>> Brian: And we talked about if that were to happen to seattle, they have been there. They're going to have confidence in that. But obviously the cross country trip to washington, go back to seattle, the cross country trip to atlanta, this crowd needs to know they can physically wear this seattle team out if they can keep this kind of pressure and it will show up in the fourth quarter. 
>> Thom: Washington has returned eight kickoffs for touchdowns, but two in a row now he's been unable to bring it out of there. Fox ufc returns SATURDAY, THE 26th. Dimitrius johnson puts his title on the line against john dodson. Rampage jackson returns. This is not a pay-per-view event, it's live, it's free and it's on fox. JANUARY 27th -- 26th, 8:00 p.M. Eastern. Fox ufc saturday is back. A pair of three-and-outs. A pair of three-play drives. Wilson had a 17-yard run. Now looking to throw, and the catch is made. You got it, zach miller is okay. He's back in the game after injuring his foot on the opening drive. 
>> Brian: They bring zach miller out of the bunch. He starts inside like he's going to cross and then just nods and goes back to the outside. Atlanta's defense lost track of the depth of the tight end, zach miller. 

[00:41:44]


>> Thom: Gain of 23, up to the 43. Wilson gets it away. Once more it's miller on the receiving end. That will be a gain of eight. 11 quarterbacks were taken in the 2012 nfl draft. Four in the first round, one in the second round. Seattle chose russell wilson with the 75th overall pick in the third round. Five of those quarterbacks started their team's season opener. Wilson the only rookie playing this weekend. Back in the hands of lynch, and that's a first down run. Spins his way inside the 45, and we welcome back chris myers. 
>> Chris: Well, thom, pete carroll said before the game we don't want to hear any excuses about a slow start, cross country travel and eastern time zone. But one thing th we did see, sidney rice, nobody came over to marshawn lynch after his fumble. But after the seahawks fell down 10-0 in the score, sidney rice ran over to russell wilson and said here we go again. 
>> Thom: Chris, thank you. Great to have chris myers with us this season. He had seven seahawk games along with tim ryan this year here on fox. That's a gain of three on first down. You talk about making that trip. Four teams from the west coast have gone back and forth into the eastern time zone in back-to-back weekends. The 1989 rams are the only team among the four that has won back-to-back weekends going to the eastern time zone. That's a long time ago. 
>> Brian: And any team naturally will say we don't want to talk about it, we don't need to acknowledge it. You're right. But it's like playing in the heat, playing when it's hot. You can still not think about it, but it's still hot. 
>> Thom: Wilson rolling, and this is what he does. And just gets rid of it. Jonathan babineaux applying pressure. Third down and eight. 

[00:43:56]


>> Brian: This is a nice job by the front four of the atlanta falcons. You can see they're keeping eyes on russell wilson. The thing you're concerned about when you've got an athletic quarterback, you've got to be patient with your pass rush, does not take a little off the edge? Yeah, it does, but you better not lose vision on him. 
>> Thom: Incomplete with an eye on golden tate. The seahawks will punt. We talked about the seattle defense giving up the two touchdown drives last week in washington. Bear in mind the seahawks offense in that first quarter had nine yards in the first quarter. They piled up 172 in the second quarter. 
>> Brian: They also saw that rg3 was limping around a little bit, and that had to give them confidence. So far I don't see anybody on that atlanta sideline limping around. 
>> Thom: Down to the 13 yard line. We'd always and will always welcome the men and women in uniform serving around the world watching our telecast in 175 countries and aboard ships at sea. The american forces, we cannot thank you for all that you do. God bless you all, watch over you, keep you well, representing and standing tall for the greatest country in the world. 
>> Brian: I get to take a trip down to guantanamo bay in the off-season, thom. I'm really looking forward to meeting the troops down there and having a chance to show our appreciation for the job that they do. 
>> Thom: You've done that before, though. 
>> Brian: I have. I spent 14 days in iraq. A life-changing experience meeting our young people. 

[00:46:02]


>> Thom: Those that have served, are serving and will serve. Roddy, look at that collision and runs through the defender. And now rodgers crossing the 50, all the way to the 41 yard line. Oh, goodness, he steam rolled earl thomas. 
>> Brian: Are we sure that's jacquizz rodgers? That looks more like marshawn lynch and looks more like michael turner. Watch this. You don't expect this kind of power in this lynchesque type of run. He's running over people, he's running through people. This is why I said coming into the game we may see jacquizz rodgers more in this role as the game continues. 
>> Thom: End of the first quarter, 10-0 atlanta. ??????

[00:48:49]


>> Brian: Well, they're having to rewrap those pads on jacquizz rodgers because that rattled him now. He kept going. I'd have to have more than my pads readjusted after a hit like that. 
>> Thom: That is a career best run for rodgers. 45 yards. And here we go to begin the second quarter at the georgia dome. The home team with a 10-0 lead and on the move. Blitz coming. Atlanta picks it up, looking for julio jones. And once more, it's sherman step for step. 
>> Brian: We've got to go back to that play. Jacquizz rodgers, you're going to see earl thomas come up and boom! Earl thomas isn't one OF THE BIG DBs SEATTLE Has but jacquizz rodgers is 5'6". Boy, when you're built that low to the ground and running with those legs, you've got to love that. That is helping set the tone. People wondered if the atlanta falcons could truly run the ball against this big, physical seattle defense. And so far it is the running game that has got them with a 10-0 lead. 
>> Thom: Roddy white to the 40, gain of two. It will bring up third down and long. Seattle defense, fourth overall. Number one scoring defense, allowing just 15 points per game. Very stingy against both the run and the pass, but already atlanta 83 rushing yards and, brian, I'm not sure anybody saw that coming. 
>> Brian: Well, what it tells seattle is that you're going to have to bring more people down than you thought you had to bring down to account for the run. That's going to set up the play action pass on the outside. 
>> Thom: Time-out seattle. Third down and eight when we return. Any pizza, toppings, sizes... ...just ten bucks. A Veggie Lover's Pizza... ...just ten bucks.

>> Thom: Welcome back to the georgia dome. Brian, we talked about it from the very begin, the pressure on this atlanta team. They have won more games than any other nfc team over the last five years in the regular season. A very good start in pursuit of that first playoff win. 
>> Brian: Yeah, two significant things. They overcame the interception by matt ryan and the way they're running the ball. I don't know that seattle really expected this to happen. 
>> Thom: Averaging over eight yards per carry. Crossing pattern, julio jones will get the first down. Able -- needed to reach the 32, down to the 30. 
>> Brian: We talked about the downfield game of julio jones and roddy white. Not the easiest thing to do to run away from these big corners. This is a big, strong receiver. Like I said, I don't know that seattle has seen a receiving corps that can match their size the way the atlanta falcons can. 
>> Thom: Turner. That's a good, solid carry on first down. He brings it down to the 26 yard line, a gain of a little better than four. 
>> Brian: Just the sheer power. I've not seen this type of power in michael turner all season long, thom. We had a lot of their games last year and we saw this time and time again. Michael turner one of those backs that can wear you out, just haven't seen it much this year. Boy, are we seeing it today. 

[00:54:48]


>> Thom: Six carries, 28 yards for turner. Everybody talks about this aerial attack, but really you go back to when mike smith arrived and matt ryan arrived in 2008, that's the year that turner arrived. They fake it to him. And gonzalez makes a catch. Wow, he did, to the 21. About a half yard short of a first down. 
>> Brian: Spectacular. You hear all the time. The word in the nfl for defenders is guys that can play long. Well, this is a tight end that can play long. That had no business being completed but it was the long arms, the focus and the beautiful hands of tony gonzalez that got that completion. 
>> Thom: Third and a yard. This was a problem down for the falcons this season. They pick it up here. We talk about turner, and brian, to get back to him for a minute. This is a guy that you brought in from san DIEGO as LaDainian tomlinson's backup. He's rushed for over 6,000 yards and 60 touchdowns. Maybe he's not this year what he's been the last number of years, he has been a huge part of this atlanta franchise turn-around. 
>> Brian: He's in his ninth year and that's typically when backs tend to slow down. Early in his career he wasn't a 300-carry guy, he was a backup in san diego. The last couple years he's been over 300 carries. That is wear and tear on the body. 
>> Thom: Rodgers getting some of the load here again today and he's to the 16 yard line. That will be a gain of three. 
>> Brian: You have to give credit to the offensive line of the atlanta falcons here as well. They're a group that a lot of the blame with the lack of the running game has fallen on their shoulders. Yeah, they protected matt ryan pretty well, but they have been labeled not as physical a group. But we're seeing some physicality here against a big, physical seattle seahawk defense. 

[00:56:56]


>> Thom: Ryan looking and now he'll go wide. Short of a first down. Chris myers. 
>> Chris: Well, thom, the excitement and energy on the seattle sideline at the start of the game has waned here. Usually russell wilson is up moving, discussing, talking with players. He's been sitting quietly and staring, mostly watching. Not a lot of energy right now on this young football team. Let's go back upstairs. 
>> Brian: You know, to that end we've talked about the travel and the back-to-back for seattle. I'm not sure the next series, if I'm atlanta, I don't come out with a little no-huddle. I'm going to increase the pace even more. Right now you are seeing a little bit of that fatigue on the part of the seattle seahawks. 
>> Thom: Third down and two, atlanta four of six on third downs so far. Early movement, uncharacteristic of this atlanta team. 
>> Referee: False start, number 77 offense. Five-yard penalty. Still third down. 
>> Brian: Thom, you talked about the lack of penalties has been a big part of it here for this atlanta falcons team. A record-setting lack of penalties. We've already seen two in this game. 
>> Thom: So third and two now goes to third and seven. Rodgers will leave in favor of jason snelling. Look at that time on the field for the seattle defense, over 14 minutes. Screen to the receiver white and skips out beautifully by brandon browner. 
>> Brian: This is a nice job. Watch browner see what's going on. They see these wide screens just pulling the trigger -- 
>> Referee: That penalty is declined. 
>> Thom: Late flag thrown in but declined denying first down yardage. What a find he was, undrafted coming out of college. Was cut by denver. Spent four years in the canadian football league. Seattle brought him in last year and he went to the pro bowl. 

[00:59:06]


>> Brian: Pete carroll said he missed on him at usc and the kid ends up going to oregon state and was beating him right and left. He said I'm not going to miss my second chance at this young man. 
>> Thom:37-yard field goal try by matt bryant. And that is hammered right down the middle. 9:13 to play until halftime. All atlanta.

[01:01:35]


>> Brian: Well, this is reminiscent of last week with that tough start in washington. We'll see if they can emotionally rebound the way they did last week in washington. 
>> Thom: Do you get the feeling, though, brian, this is an important offensive series if for no other reason, confidence. 
>> Brian: They have got to show they can do something else other than hand the ball off to marshawn lynch. 
>> Thom: Well, washington will bring it out deep from his own end zone and he spins his way up to the 30 yard line. Of course next sunday, awaiting the winner of this one, frank gore AND THE 49ers. And then which team will advance on to the super bowl? It's the nfc championship game, next sunday. 2:00 eastern time, only on fox. 13-0 falcons. Wilson and the seahawks from the 30. And once more, it's miller, a huge gain down the middle of the field. Brian, you thought he would be a big factor coming into this game, and so far he has been. 
>> Brian: Well, what's happening is the entire front seven, plus the safety of the atlanta falcons, were up in the box to account for marshawn lynch. And that's what allowed zach miller to get in behind it to that second level. That's twice now we've seen the atlanta defense lose track of the depth of the tight end miller. 
>> Thom:44 yards on the catch and now wilson will throw it again on first down. All day to throw. And that's golden tate to the 20 yard line for a first down. Getting to the quarterback is not a strength for either one of these defenses. 

[01:03:37]


>> Brian: You can see right here with just a simple four-man rush, they can't get home. That gives russell wilson all the time he needs to throw this deep, long comeback on the outside. We said they needed to do something else besides hand off to marshawn lynch. They figured out what that something else is. 
>> Thom: Lynch cuts it back to the inside. That will be a gain of three on first down. Lynch joined shawn alexander and chris warren as the only two backs in seahawks history to rush for better than 1500 yards in a season. They were not very efficient in the red zone last week, even winning the game. 
>> Brian: I think part of the problem for russell wilson in terms of throwing down here, I don't know that he has a go-to guy like matt ryan has with roddy white or tony gonzalez to go to in the red zone. 
>> Thom: Screen to lynch. Cuts it back to the inside. Is shoved by his own linemen. He appears to be about a yard short of a first down. It is third down and one. First time in a game seattle is knocking on the door. 
>> Brian: I know you want to get that first down, and I know atlanta is going to be coming up into the box, but what a huge opportunity to maybe make that play down in the end zone. Marshawn lynch is not in the game and they're in gun. 
>> Thom: They give it to turbin, and he is very, very close. Russell wilson is saying first down. They may have to measure. 

[01:05:50]


>> Brian: You can see pete carroll right at the top. He wasn't sure they were going to get the playoff. Carroll is not thinking why is marshawn lynch not in the game? 
>> Thom: They have got a fourth down and pete carroll is going for it. 
>> Brian: This is confidence in your team to tell you where they think they are in this game, to have to go for a fourth down. 
>> Thom: They give it to the young man and he is denied the first down! Third and one, fourth and one. Lynch does not get the BALL ON EITHER DOWN.ites attract. But does that work for a car?

[01:08:35]


>> Thom: What a stop by the falcons defense. ON FOURTH ANe ONE. So now matt ryan puts it in the hands of turner from the 12 yard line, and turner up to the 15. 
>> Brian: Let's go back. You're going to see them plug up the inside and a free runner in william moore. If you're going to stop someone on a fourth and one, typically it takes a free runner like this to do it. 
>> Thom: Celebrating on that falcons sideline. Turner wants more. First down yaage and then some. He rumbles his way up just shy of midfield to the 48 yard line. Mike johnson, mike cox leading the way. 
>> Brian: Right here on the edge they go into jumbo personnel. Mike johnson out at tackle lining up as a tight end. I can't say enough about this offensive line of the atlanta falcons. Much maligned for their lack of running game this season, and right now they are man handling the bigger, what was thought to be the more physical seattle defense. 
>> Thom: Nine carries, 66 yards for turner. On first down, ryan, and a flag is thrown. Kam chancellor looking around. As gonzalez hit the deck. 
>> Brian: Just working down the field, and they almost -- it looks like they kind of get tied up with one another. 
>> Referee: Prior to the pass, holding number 31 defense. Five-yard penalty. Automatic firstdown. 
>> Brian: I'm not sure who's holding who there, but when you're on the way to the hall of fame, you're probably going to get a few calls your way. I'm not saying anything.

>> Brian: Okay. 
>> Thom: Of course you are. 
>> Brian: Yeah. It does buy you a little cache. 
>> Thom: Gus bradley doesn't want to hear that. 
>> Brian: No, no. That's not going to be fair to him. 
>> Thom: Defensive coordinator, he's already interviewed for the philadelphia eagles head coaching job. He told us yesterday he will interview for two other head coaching vacancies. Wouldn't say which teams. Looking for roddy white. Touchdown! 47 yards scoring stripe, ryan to roddy white. And now a point after away from a 20-0 lead. Boy, you get that huge stop. Brian, you talk about momentum and emotion all the time in this game of football. Third down and one stop. Fourth down and one stop. You get a big carry by turner and then, bang. 
>> Brian: Let's back it up even further. The big penalty on the atlanta offense that forced them to go for three points. Then seattle goes the length of the field. And for the defense to respond the way they did and then matt ryan and this offense to come in and respond to that, it's going all atlanta's way right now. 
>> Thom: Of course they review every scoring play, and they're just making sure that white had complete control of the football, which he did. They're going to double check once more. ?????? ??????

>> Thom: Well, we wondered what would matt ryan do following a turnover if he had one. Pretty doggone good. 
>> Referee: The ruling on the field is confirmed. The receiver the possession going to the ground, touchdown. 
>> Thom: Confirming what you saw. Walt coleman throws an exclamation point on that 47-yard touchdown catch, and pete carroll's team looking for something, anything. And he'll sout it. Pete's a loose guy. 
>> Brian: Oh, yeah. Like we said, the difference is when they started to see washington struggle a little bit, that gave them the confidence to come back. There's nothing -- no struggle in this atlanta falcon team right now. They're going to have to do it on their own. I'm talking about the seattle seahawks. 

[01:15:16]


>> Thom: Bryant with the point after. 4:16 until halftime. Atlanta 20, the seahawks 0. 
>> Brian: Well, matt ryan took his shot and it was beautifully thrown down the middle of the field. Watch kam chancellor at the top. We saw it last night in the bre ravens/denver broncos game. How does the deepest center field player, in this instance kam chancellor, let roddy white get in behind him? You have got to stay as deep as the deepest. Matt ryan had to say, boy, just let me get this ball up and down. 
>> Thom: A chance for the seahawks to get a little momentum in their favor. 4:16 to play until halftime. Couple of time-outs. They had a good drive the last time they had the football. But could not convert on third down. And then pete carroll elected to go for it on fourth down and a yard. And washington will take a knee. Brian, I must ask you, there are many seahawks fans that are asking the question, as you take a look at what's transpired so far, lynch the early turnover, tony gonzalez with a touchdown reception, that fourth down and one, ball given to michael robinson. They take advantage of that and a scoring strike. I know a lot of seahawks fans are saying how do you have a third and one, how do you have a fourth and one and you don't give it to a guy who had almost 1600 yards rushing. Is that a fair question? 

[01:17:25]


>> Brian: Yeah, it is. With the sheer size of it you want to obviously go against tendency and you want to do it with your entire team, but I'm with you. At least one of those don't you want to give it to marshawn lynch. 
>> Thom: Turbin up to the 25. Now, it should be noted there was a lot of concern and a lot of alarm about marshawn lynch not practicing wednesday of this week. Pete carroll said look, he has not practiced on wednesdays over the entire second half of the season. He has been bothered with a tender right foot. But he didn't look like anything was wrong with him last week in d.C. 
>> Brian: Thom, i promise you, there's no player on any football team that takes more beating than a running back. No running back takes all the snaps this late in the season. 
>> Thom: Golden tate, he brings it up for a first down to the 38 yard line. Chris myers to the sideline. 
>> Chris: Thom, the noise here has had an effect. The offensive linemen of the seahawks complaining they had trouble hearing. They missed an alert on that third and one and fourth and one so russell wilson during that last defensive possession for the seahawks talked to his line and said they're going to have to go with more hand signals or tapping the linemen so they get the right play to the right people. 
>> Thom: Chris, thank you. 3:07. And this is lynch. That's a gain of a yard. 
>> Brian: Thom, we talked about in the open we've been in this building many times and these are great fans, but sometimes it takes them a while to get cranked up. You got the sense this week being in town that there was a little bit of, well, we want to see how they do. I know it's the divisional round. We want to see them win that playoff game. Thismentum is building. If this should hold through and atlanta should go to the championship game and have san francisco come here, this building will be rocking from day one. 
>> Thom: Lynch appears to be a little tender. Nursing that right foot some. Wilson being chased, won't get got and he is very close to a first down. That may take us down to the 2:00 warning. It is a first down. Wilson trying to get them up to the line of scrimmage. 

[01:19:51]


>> Brian: Not going to happen. 
>> Thom: Nope. 2:00 warning. here. This is our year. I thought it was last year... Turns out i was wrong. None of us would walk in here and settle. That's how we are! I forgot what I was going to say. Patrick, I want 100% commitment! Because I care man, ok? Who are we!? 49ers!49ers!49ers! Yeah!

[01:22:27]


>> Thom: Pete carroll's seahawks with the football at their own 48 yard line. What a turn-around carroll has orchestrated, along with general manager john schneider. Second youngest team in the league. And the hottest team in the nfc. They have dug themselves a 20-0 hole. Marshawn lynch, jonathan babineaux there to meet him. Lynch eight carries, 28 yards in the game. 
>> Brian: There again, you can see with just a standard box and now they're going to get william moore in there as well. Look at all the bodies. Look at the red shirts swarming to the tackle. They knew that was going to be the key in stopping marshawn lynch. 
>> Thom: There would have been a lot more yardage on that throw to miller if he didn't have to leave his feet to catch it, but it is a first down. Clock down to 1:25. Ball at the atlanta 32. Leon washington into the backfield. Catch, and it is another first down. That's sidney rice, his first reception of the game. We're under 1:00. 
>> Brian: Clearly atlanta is playing not to give up the touchdown. At this point they're inside field goal range so they'll give up just about anything underneath but just can't give up that shot into the end zone. 
>> Thom: Wilson just throws it away. 
>> Brian: We talked about the difficulty of a four-man rush getting home on russell wilson when you have to constantly spy as to where he's at. We really haven't seen a lot of pressure on him, but part of it is they kept him pretty well contained. Of course we're looking at john abraham who had that ankle injury to finish the season. You wondered how that was going to affect them. They may be saving him for later in the game right now and not wanting to waste th reps early. 

[01:24:54]


>> Thom: Second and ten. It is miller again. That's a gain of nine. Five catches for miller. Take a time-out. 
>> Laura: You were just talking about the status of john abraham who came in with that ankle injury. Right now he is questionable, reinjured it. He is right now questionab return. 
>> Thom: Cliff matthews takes his place. It's third and one. Quick slant with the catch made by golden tate and that's enough for a first down. Seattle with one time-out remaining. And they will spending their final time-out. It's first and goal. And while we have a moment, let's send it back to los angeles to curt menefee. 
>> Curt: Coming up on the visa halftime, our guys will break down the first half from hotlanta like no one else can and we'll have an exclusive interview with a quarterback one of these teams will face NEXT SUNDAY, 49ers Quarterback colin kaepernick. It's all coming up on the visa halftime. See you then. 
>> Thom: First and goal for seattle. 25 seconds remain. Hawks are out of time-outs. Pretty evident zach miller has been his security blanket in this game. 

[01:27:00]


>> Brian: Yeah, 10 and 10 for ten completions. Five of them were to zach miller. Right now you're going to see zach miller on the outside. They may be looking to try to get that one-on-one matchup on the outside with zach miller. 
>> Thom: Trying to get it in the back of the end zone to rice. Outstanding coverage. Asante samuel. In the postseason very few cornerbacks have played better than samuel. 
>> Brian: He doesn't necessarily like to be on the inside. They got him there by putting zach miller on the outside, but asante samuel, as good as second guessing, and I mean that in a complimentary way, due to his film studies, he knows when to guess and when not to. 
>> Thom: And atlanta is going toave to call a time-out. Unable to get it. Oh, they did. Apparently mike smith is screaming from that sideline. They had a man uncovered all the way to the far right side of that spread formation. Talk about samuel playing in his 20th postseason game. Of course many of those with new england. Seven playoff interceptions and holds the all-time record with four of those returned for a touchdown in the playoffs. 
>> Brian: I had fun listening to him out at practice the other day. He was coaching them all up. He was getting after the offensive coordinator every throw. Yeah, I like that one. No, no, no, I don't want to see that one. He was telling michael turner after a play, hey, you get in the end zone like that, that's 23 hamburgers. He said, oh, by the way, that's not a bounty. 
>> Thom: Well, you've got to entice the big fellow. 
>> Brian: That's right. He used the right incentive as well. Now seattle looks confused. 
>> Thom: Seattle does not have a time-out. Cliff matthews is replacing john abraham. 

[01:29:11]


>> Referee: False start, number 76 offense. Five-yard penalty. Still second down. 
>> Thom: He saw okung move. 
>> Brian: And you see kroy biermann moving around russell wilson and offensive line trying to account for that movement. We talked about this undersized atlanta falcon defense that has to scheme its way into certain pressure, and clearly right there that brought about the penalty as they were trying to sort out the protection. 
>> Thom: Second and goal from the 11. That had no chance from the start. Visa halftime coming up. Curt, terry, howie, michael and jimmy will break it down from the first half here. An interview with colin kaepernick. My, oh my, was he sensational last night. 49ers FOR A SECOND Straight year will play in the nfc championship game. Big play here, third and goal from the 11. Wilson is sacked! By babineaux. And now they have to hurry. They're going to go for it. They won't even get a snap off! 
>> Brian: Wow. 
>> Thom: They throw it to the end zone. Now we wait -- no, unable after the sack to get the field goal unit out. Out of time-outs. An already difficult opening half for seattle ends in bitter fashion. 
>> Brian: That is a rookie quarterback in a stressful situation with a tired football team that's been worn out by the team on the field and the fans in the stadium. That was a tough way to ending the half for the seattle seahawks. 

[01:31:15]


>> Thom:20-0 at halftime. The nfl on fox will continue with the visa halftime report right after this.??& is at 97%. mmm, tasty. And cut! Very good. People are always asking me how we make these GEICO adverts. So we're taking you behind the scenes. This coffee cup, for example, is computer animated. It's not real. GEICO's customer satisfaction is quite real though. This computer-animated coffee tastes dreadful. GEICO. 15 minutes could save you 15% or more on car insurance. Someone get me a latte will ya, please? 

[01:34:13]


>> Curt: Tony gonzalez trying to win the first playoff game of his 16-year nfl career doing his part as atlanta is shutting out seattle 20-0 at halftime in this divisional playoff matchup. As we welcome you to the visa halftime, seattle missed an opportunity to put some points on the board at the end of the first half. Otherwise, michael, it's been all atlanta. 
>> Michael: It's been all atlanta. Whenever you go on the road and play against the number one seeded team in the nfc, you have to protect the ball and make the most of your opportunities. Marshawn lynch, one of the most physical runners in the league, always gets yard after initial contact but you have to be aware of the guy coming from the back side to strip the ball. That strip led to an atlanta touchdown which only built the confidence of the falcons. Right now seattle has an uphill battle. 
>> Howie: Terry talked about matt ryan slinging the ball down the field and he's taken a lot of big shots down the field. He has a couple of nice back shoulder throws. One to chase coffman sets up a first and goal inside the 2 yard line. Then following it up with tony gonzalez. How many times have we seen this in the back of the end zone. The awareness, the chemistry between the two. A back shoulder throw. Tony gonzalez gets his feet down. I think the big difference in the first half has been the balance with rodgers, turner and the running game makes them really difficult to deal with. 
>> Jimmy: Seattle has so many scoring opportunities not only at the end of the first half but earlier, they had a third down and one. Marshawn lynch wasn't in the ball game. They run it up the middle. They don't get it, okay, fourth down and one. They handing t to the fullback. So they don't get -- this could have been a 13-7 score. Instead atlanta takes the ball and goes right down the field and makes it 20-0. Missed opportunities, and that's hurting seattle. 
>> Terry: Seattle fans, don't get upset here. Let's not forget what happened last week. Down 14-0 early on the road in washington. You came back with 24 unanswered points and won that game 24-14. They're moving the ball. They just, as jimmy said, three points and then three more points, six points makes a big difference in a ball game like this. 

[01:36:15]


>> Curt: At some point you've got to score. They haven't done that yet. We'll finding out how they do as we continue here on the visa halftime. We'll talk more about that game as matt ry and the falons, roddy white for the visa play of the first half and a 20-0 ball game right now. They are trying to get to face san francisco in the nfc championship game. When we come back, we'll talk to the san francisco quarterback, colin kaepernick. 

[01:38:28]


>> Curt: Welcome back to the visa halftime. OF COURSE LAST NIGHT THE 49ers Knocked the green bay packers out of the playoffs 45-31 to earn a trip to the nfc title game next sunday on fox. Joining us right now is the quarterback of the niners, colin kaepernick. Colin, first of all, congratulations. Secondly, you know, you made your first playoff start last night. All you did was set multiple records, including 181 yards rushing, most ever for a quarterback in any game. You obviously surprised the world. Did you surprise yourself at all? 
>> I wasn't expecting to rush for that amount of yards, but we knew we had some running plays in for the quarterback this week. We just didn't know they were going to work that well. 
>> Terry: Terry bradshaw. I was blown away by your performance last night. Two questions quickly. All of us are wondering, all of us are wondering, how fast did you run the 40? That's my first question, because you're plenty fast. And then the second question i would want to know, a you quarterback in his first playoff game throws an interception, runs to the sideline. What did jim harbaugh say to you? 
>> The fastest 40 I've ran is a 4.43. And after I threw the interception, he came to the sidelines and said there's a lot of football left. I think everybody was pretty confident that we were going to bounce back from that. 
>> Michael: You have a team full of veteran players and ever since you've taken over, has there been any vet that stepped up and is your confidant and given you any advice? If so, what have they said to you? 
>> A lot of my teammates have said different things to me throughout me starting. I think the biggest thing everybody has been telling me is go out and play like yourself and you'll be fine. 
>> Curt: Thanks for joining us, colin. Congratulations. Once again, we'll see you next week. So the second seeded niners are in the championship game. Will it be the number one seeded falcons who have a 20-0 right now or will seattle come back? They get the bto start the second half right after this. 

[01:43:48]


>> Thom: Just about to start the third quarter. 20-0 atlanta. Follow your favorite team all season long. Just go to itunes.Com/nfl. Yesterday here at the dome, 40 young athletes competed in the nfl punt, pass and kick national finals. Five different age divisions. Nfl punt, pass and kick began celebrating its 51st anniversary. Dan marino and our very own troy aikman competed in the competition as youngsters. Troy said he didn't do very well. I find that hard to believe. 
>> Brian: I used to love the one time in baltimore I came out and watched those kids throwing. I got excited until i realized about half of them were better than the three guys I had playing for me so then I got depressed. Love to see these kids competing. 
>> Thom: It was the end of the first quarter that the seahawks got it turned around last week. Many are wondering did they get the play off before the game clock expired. It should be noted, a, they did not get it off and, b, it is not reviewable under the current replay system. We're going to visit with mike pereira back in los angeles on that topic. We understand a lot of you were curious. So too is t seahawks media relations staff as to whether or not that play got off before the end of the half. And mike pereira, how about it? What happened here at the end of the half? 
>> Well, as you saw when they actually superimposed the game clock on the screen, they did not get it off. You can see that. But even if they would have, seattle was not set and that would have created a ten-second runoff. They did not have a time-out left, so the half would have been over either way and you wouldn't have had a play. 
>> Thom: Always great to have our good friend, mike pereira, joining us from back in los angeles. Long-time head of nfl officials. So here we go in the third quarter. Can seattle get it turned around, trailing 20-0? And wilson to throw it on first down. He's done a lot of that in this game today, and that has not been the m.O. When the seahawks have been unbelievably successful over the second half of the year. It's been primarily due to the best rushing attack in the nfl. 

[01:46:14]


>> Brian: Which leads to the typical play action pass shot down the field. Russell wilson is having to do it from almost a straight dropback every time right now. 
>> Thom: Ten-yard reception by sidney rice to begin the second half. They give it to lynch. It's a gain of two. Let's check in from the atlanta sideline with laura. 
>> Laura: Thom, if anyone is surprised by the 20-0 score, they're not alone. No fewer than five players walked off mouthing wow to me. They said don't look at that scoreboard, be more aggressive and we'll keep doing that by having our aggressive play calling mixing it up and running this half. 
>> Thom: Seattle rushing for just 57 yards in the first half. Wilson to throw it on second down. And now he'll run it. Still on his feet, close to midfield and that's a first down up to the 49 yard line. Their best runs have come from the quarterback wilson. 
>> Brian: They have, because again, you're going to see this is just a four-man rush. They're kind of spying, trying to watch and make sure russell wilson doesn't yet outside. Unlike colin kaepernick last night that we saw in the san francisco game, so far this has been the lesser of a couple of evils. They haven't given up those big passing plays down the field. 
>> Thom: John abraham to begin this second half, cliff matthews fills in for him. An eight-yard game by turbin. Let's go to the seattle side line with chris myers. 
>> Chris: Pete carroll said he wasn't going to deviate much from his original game plan even down 20-0. But they have to gamble to put more pressure on matt ryan on defense. He said russell wilson made a mistake not getting rid of the ball on third down, taking the sack. He said marshawn lynch is fine but we may see more read option with russell wilson in the second half. 

[01:48:18]


>> Thom: Thank you, chris. Thank you, laura. Gain of seven on first down. It's second and three. Lynch very close to a first down, needed to get to the 41. Maybe just short. Lynch, 132 rushg yards last week in washington. Nine for 28. And again on a third down and a yard as he was on the last third and one, lynch is standing on the seahawks sidelines. 
>> Brian: And they empty the backfield with no one back there with russell wilson, unless they wedge it just like this and it works. That, at least, made sense in terms of if you're going to run the quarterback wedge. Marshawn lynch out of the game, make them think you're going to do something other than the quarterback wedge. It doesn't do any good to have marshawn lynch standing behind you if you're going to wedge the ball. It's a unique look. It's their version of the pistol offense. 
>> Thom: Fake the run. Wilson moving around. Still moving. He's caught from behind by vance walker. 
>> Brian: Mike nolan is going to be needing to rotate these defensive linemen through because they're going to wear down a little bit. Nice job down the field with no place to go. Zach miller on the outside. This is where russell wilson has usually pulled it down and made some good yardage. He tried to find someone to dump it off to and then went vertical. Darrell bevell trying to create something down the field to get that one big play they can hang their hat on. 

[01:50:25]


>> Thom: Second down and 18. And a quick hit and that is a first down reception on a second down and 18 on a catch by miller. Who has been by far the best seahawks offensive player in this game today. Six receptions for 113 yards. 
>> Brian: That's got to be a blown assignment. You're going to see this vacated area right here. Someone needs to buzz to that. It looks like william moore played too far inside before he buzzed out to the tight end that allowed the wide-open zach miller to get the big yards. 
>> Thom: Wilson to throw it on first down. A wide open golden tate inside the 5 and he'll tiptoe into the end zone. A touchdown for the seahawks. Opening drive of this third quarter, and the seahawks finally reach the end zone. 
>> Brian: Well, thomas DeCOUD COMES OUT Underneath. This is a free safety that's buzzing underneath. That allowed dunta robinson to rotate over the top to where normally a safety would be, and basically a miscommunication. YOU'VE GOTDBs IN Unnatural positions with the corner going to the hash safety and the safety going to the flat, not really conversant as to where they needed to be to execute that defense. 
>> Thom: Point after by ryan longwell is good. So life on the visitors side. 20-7 atlanta. Today's business travel challenge: Change fee-asco. The other airlines versus southwest. And they're off! Let's see what today has in store. Change flight to tomorrow. 
[ Announcer 2 ] THAT'S NOT A PROBLEM ON SOUTHW They don't charge a fee when your plans change. But the other airlines could hit him for 150 bucks in change fees. Oh!! That's going to sting his bottomline. He's onboard with no change fees. Business travelers win with southwest. Time. You won't find it on any clock, or specific time zone. Miller Time ISN'T SO MUCH ABOUT WHEN, AS It is about who. It's about the friends you go to bat for. The ones who'll be there when they say they will. Even if being there means crossing state lines. With no questions asked. Because guys that leave no buddy behind deserve a beer that leaves no taste behind. And with great friends and a great tasting light beer, it's not just a good time. IT'S Miller Time. bucket table, everybody knows it's about to get real up in here. If you don't show up with kfc at my couchgate, you're not showing up. You're showing down.

>> Thom: Nice of the staff at the georgia aqbrian, be part of the billboards waving the nfl on fox sign. 
>> Brian: Here you can see smith talking to DeCOUD ABOUT WHERE HE Needed to be. Obviously russell wilson excited about having that nine-play 80-yard drive to star the half. 
>> Thom: This is rodgers from the 3 yard line. And he is leveled at the 20. Mercy. Jeremy lane the big hit. Now seattle's defense needs a stop. "Ok, here we go!" "Today, I'm gonna teach you how..." "...to save the world" "...get a scooter" "...eat together as a family" "...say yes more" "...make it happen" "Organize it by color" "Inside out" "Quick, quick, slow" "There are gonna be ups and downs" "It will come" "Breathe" "You have to start somewhere" "Keep going, keep going" "You can do anything" "Thumbs up, everybody.

[01:55:57]


[ Male Announcer ] THE DURABILITY OF THE Volkswagen passat. Pass down something he will be grateful for. TT THAT'S THE POWERrr OF GERMAN ENGINEERING. ?????? ?????? back to you. 
>> Thom: Seattle hoping to make playoff history. 20 points the largest road deficit for a comeback win in the history of the nfl when detroit did it out in san francisco, going back to 1957. First down, they pitch it to michael turner, who had an outstanding first half. And that's a gain of six. 
>> Brian: Well, we saw seattle emotionally respond to being down 20-0 at half, coming out, going the length of the field. This is a spot the atlanta offense can come out, maybe redial up that opening sequence where they were able to literally run down the field with michael turner, jacquizz rodgers, with a couple of shots down the field. They would like nothing better than to run the ball down the throat of the seattle seahawks right here to respond to that score. 
>> Thom: They call it a gain of five by turner. This time it's rodgers, and he lost a half yard. Brandon mebane cong down the line to get him. 
>> Brian: Obviously seattle thought the same thing. We're not going to let you get this running game cranked up on us. Got an eight-man box with a nice job of mebane closing from the back side preventing any kind of gain from rodgers. 

[01:58:14]


>> Thom: So very important third down for this seahawks defense. Atlanta four of seven converting on third downs so far. Blitz coming. And the catch is made by gonzalez, and that appears to be a first down. Needed to get to the 30. And that's right on it, just beyond it, first down. 
>> Brian: That's why we put the highlighter on tony gonzalez. Matt ryan talks about how he had to get used to the fact that he could throw the ball just about anywhere to tony gonzalez. But to get on the same page as to where gonzalez, even though covered, might anticipate where that ball might be thrown, that's why he goes to him in such critical situations, particularly in the third and medium and third and short. 
>> Thom: They set up a screen to rodgers and seattle saw it coming. Alan branch, k.J. Wright. That will be a gain of maybe a yard. 
>> Brian: Even though that didn't get a lot of yards, matt ryan talked about how he really enjoyed this year infusing the screen game. That was kind of devoid of the offense last year and the ability to get the screen game cranked up. That's the first screen we've seen today, maybe we'll see more. 
>> Thom: They scored six touchdowns off the screen this season, by far the most of any team in the league. Great reception. Catch and a first down by julio jones. Brian, we brought up earlier no chris clemons. The seahawks d had 36 sacks with clemons. We have not called bruce irvin's name all day today. 
>> Brian: That has been a factor in these completions down the field because this route takes a while to crank up. Nice job of -- look at the eyes on the ball, looking at to the catch. Particularly going across the middle when you know you're apt to get lit up. 

[02:00:34]


>> Thom: Close to the 50. Justin blaylock lost a helmet there. This guy never missed a start in almost five years since coming to the falcons. 
>> Brian: He's been a nice anchor for them. Sam baker the left tackle has been in and out of the lineup with injury over the last couple years. todd McClure may be on the back end of his career. They really like their rookie right guard who's done a nice job for them. 
>> Thom: To the far side, the catch is made by harry douglas. First time we've called his name today, and that's a first down to the 44 yard line. 
>> Brian: Watch the backfield pick up this pressure, this blitz. You don't see a lot of blitzing from seattle. They got a hat on a hat and there again, thom, giving matt ryan a chance to come out late to harry douglas. 
>> Thom: Douglas on a lot of teams would be catching 50, 60, 70 passes a year. When you're playing on the atlanta team that has two 1,000-yard receivers, a tight end with 93 receptions, it's tough getting the football. Looking for douglas. And could not hang on. Sherman step for step, but looked to be a catchable ball. 
>> Brian: Well, there's always a question. It's like a three-legged sack race here. Who pushed who, who does what. They're going to let him play to a degree. Harry douglas, this really isn't his deal being that outside receiver. They leave that pretty much julio jones and roddy white. Douglas got away with just a little bit of a push there. 
>> Thom: Second down and ten. Jones inside the 20, all the way to the 22 yard line. 

[02:02:52]


>> Brian: Just a quick little inside slant, a very nice play design by dirk koetter, the offensive coordinator. Taking underneath coverage away from it, giving matt ryan an easy completion to the 6'3", 220-pound julio jones. 
>> Thom: Tenth play of this drive following the touchdown by the seahawks. Rodgers for a yard. 
>> Brian: We talked about the emotional response of the atlanta falcons after seattle went the distance. This is just the kind of drive head coach mike smith wants, because not only has it put them in scoring position, but it's chewing down some big clock here as we're down coming under 4:00 of the third quarter. That's just the kind of drive he wanted to orchestrate. 
>> Thom: I don't think anybody saw this coming. You know, you sit around and you talk about games and how they should play out each and every week. If somebody would have said to you before the week began that in the third quarter one team would have nearly double the rushing yards of the other, and this is incomplete. Brian, I think you would have said and i think everybody would have said seattle would be the team who's rushed for 142 yards by this point in the game. That belongs to atlanta. 
>> Brian: And what a boost for them after the three playoff losses over the last couple years. Mike smith with the bye had to change something out. Even if it was just for change sake, to give the players good to hang their hat on and say, okay, we're going to be okay now. Clearly they felt like they could run the ball, and it's played out beautifully for them today. 
>> Thom: Blitz coming. Ryan delivers, and look at the strength of tony gonzalez. He just rips it away om winston guy. 
>> Brian: Once again, we see seattle is having to bring more pressure to try to get to matt ryan. That creates one-on-ones down the field. Winston guy at 6'1" is no match for the bigger, more athletic tony gonzalez. 

[02:05:07]


>> Thom: What a player, what a player. Going to his 13th pro bowl. This has been one of his best seasons of his 16 years. Throw to rodgers and he's down to the 6 yard line. Wrapped up by wagner. 
>> Brian: You know, matt ryan down here, a big part of their confidence in matt ryan is he is very sound in the red zone in terms of understanding the pace of the game. Right now three points would be huge because it takes it to that three-score differential. Knowing that to come away with any points at all responding to seattle's drive is huge, I don't see him taking an unduly risk in terms of putting the ball in the end zone. 
>> Thom: It would be the first tme in his fourth career playoff game. Ryan has 200 yards passing and it's snelling who finds the end zone! 
>> Brian: Dirk koetter, the offensive coordinator, loving that play. You know this is one of those plays you might practice and practice and practice for weeks without calling it. Calling it at just the right time to get the score. All they're going to do is bring everything out to the right and trail jason snelling with a little shovel pass, really getting the seattle seahawks to close. Great response by the #s ATLANTA FALCONS. 
>> Thom: You took the words right after my mouth. After a nine-play, 80-yard touchdown drive to get some momentum the seahawks' way, matt ryan and company. That one is blocked by richard sherman. And I've got to believe he started too early, didn't he? 
>> Brian: No, they got it. 

[02:07:09]


>> Referee: Offsides, number 25 defense. Half the distance to the goal. Retry. 
>> Brian: He didn't have -- he got offsides so quickly, he didn't have a chance, didn't have the time to pull the flag. 
>> Thom: Snelling for six years has been a backup here in atlanta. We were here for his career day a couple of seasons ago and wondered if the former georgia cavalier would ever get a chance to be an every down back. He's battled through injuries the last couple of seasons but has been rock solid. So the point after is good. Snelling the touchdown, 27-7. 
>> Referee: Offsides, number 25 on the defense. That five-yard penalty will be assessed on the kickoff. The extra point is good. want ? That's the question. Every day. When you have the most advanced tools, you want to make something with them. Something that helps. Helps safeguard our shores. Helps someone see through a wall of fire.

[02:10:16]


>> Thom: Well, there are 80-yard drives and there are 80-yard drives but when you have 14 plays and chew up 7:36 to make it 27-7, that is an 80-play drive. After the penalty, ryan will particular it through the end zone. Down by 20. Pressure of the postseason. Pete carroll and the seahawks feeling it big-time right now. dream? I'm having one right now. I don't want to be disturbed. And I won't. Because before I went to sleep, I set this. Now my iphone knows not to ring, unless it's important.

[02:12:40]


>> Thom:2:11 to play here in the third quarter. Seattle from its own 20, trailing by 20. Play to the right side, it's a gain of five. When every play matters, and it does right now, turn to nfl mobile coverage of every nfl game. Call star star nfl to get it for just $5 all month long. 
>> Brian: We've seen a few of these read options by russell wilson. He has yet to keep one. I don't know whether that's by design or they're just saving it for the right moment. But I would think now would be about that right moment. 
>> Thom: Fakes the run and now looking to throw. Fires down the middle. Tate came back to get the ball and tate up to the 48 yard line. That will be a first down. 
>> Brian: And this is what has happened. AS THE DBs FALL OUT, He scrambles around, the linebackers are gobbled up with the potential of russell wilson pulling down. And again, the big plays we've seen by the seattle seahawks are on plays where the linebackers have to settle and that second level receiver has gotten in behind him. 
>> Thom: Golden tate had a game-winning 24-yard touchdown as time expired against green bay in week three. Now wilson fires and it's caught by rice. That's a first down at the atlanta 40. Their last drive 80 yards after just getting 193 over five possessions in the first half. A scoreless first half. Wilson looks down the field. And there's miller left alone once more. And he's out of bounds at the 13 yard line. Nine seconds left in the third quarter. Seahawks in business. 

[02:14:56]


>> Brian: There again, it's that intermediate level, about 20 yards deep. AS THE DBs FALL OFF Taking away the big play, the linebackers getting gobbled up underneath by the play fake. The shallow receivers. That's three times now we've seen zach miller get into that 20-yard area with throws in behind the linebackers. 
>> Thom: That will be the final play of the third quarter. 27-7 atlanta. The nfl on fox will continue after a break from your local fox herere breakfast donuts. it? Turkey sausage. Turkey what? Amazing. Dunkin's new turkey sausage breakfast sandwich. Surprisingly great sausage taste with under 400 calories. Try one today. America runs on dunkin'. !

Ray anderson, the nfl's executive vice president of football operations will congratulate the punt, pass and kick national champions. From the 6 and 7-year-olds, hayden kurtz, patria rumley.

>> Thom: So we're set to begin the fourth quarter. Brian, mike smith, you've known him well, known him a long time. He's standing on that sideline with a 20-point lead, that clock, I would imagine, can't tick quickly enough. 

[02:19:30]


>> Brian: Just starting the fourth quarter, but it is a factor in the play calling both offensively and defensively as we progress to the end of the game. 
>> Thom: A rough time in red zone for these seahawks, even last week. These two guys hit one another, these teammates. That is one violent collision. Watch this. 
>> Brian: Sean weatherspoon kind of misses, and now is straight up trying to come back into it and asante samuel comes back in and just pops weatherspoon, who didn't quite get to it, but just popped him with a big hit. 
>> Thom: Turbin down to the 1 yard line. That will be a first down. 
>> Brian: You know, the book would say if you don't get it here on third down, you kick the field goal to bring it to a two-score differential, but the way this game has gone I'm not sure pete carroll is not going to go for it on fourth down if they don't get it here. Excuse me, first down. He got the first, my mistake. 
>> Thom: Lynch. And no signal given yet. Nope, he's down short of the goal line. 
>> Brian: I'm still thinking about that 20 points. I lost that touchdown by the falcons, that last one. That changes it. That's clearly down here, and obviously he'll have a couple goes at it, but he's going to have three more shots because kicking a field goal here does him no good. 
>> Thom: Then you're still down to three scores. 
>> Brian: Absolutely. 

[02:21:36]


>> Thom: They fake it to him. And wilson will run it in for the touchdown. So now a point after away from trailing by 13. 
>> Brian: That was a tough one for them. They sold out on the inside. You're going to see it all crash down in here to stop marshawn lynch, which left nobody on the outside, as russell wilson pulls it down for the score. I don't know if you can call that a block as much as it is a fetal curl-up and let them tackle me. 
>> Thom: Of course it was wilson who made the big block in front of lynch last week in washington. And the point after by longwell is good. So with 00 to go, 27-14, line and the falcons in front. Can they hang on? Stas with brothers. Not the ones who share your dna. The ones you choose. The ones who haven't called you by your real name in years.

[02:24:19]


>> Thom: Trying to defy postseason odds, pete carroll and the seahawks, teams trailing by 20 or more at halftime, the results are not good. 
>> Brian: Right now seattle is not thinking about that. I'd just as soon not be the one. I'd be saying let's make history now. There's sheer odds somebody is going to do it. 
>> Thom: Rodgers will take a knee. 13:01 to play here in atlanta. this happy.

[02:26:40]


>> Thom: Russell wilson has been able to put up a pair of touchdowns here in the second half, after getting blanked in the first half. But needing the ball back at least twice more. Michael turner. What an outstanding game turner has had. And I'm not sure anybody thought this might be coming. In fact there was some falcon fans we ran into at our hotel last night that said please tell me we're not going to see michael turner and the old three yards and a cloud of turf, if you will. Well, turner pretty good today. 12 rushes, 83 yards. 
>> Brian: When we asked dirk koetter about the plan for michael turner, he kind of burred a little bit like i don't care what you're hearing, this guy can still bring the load and we're going to count on him. 
>> Thom: Gain of nine on first down and now gets it on second down and that will be good enough for turner. Tell me what's going on on fox. 
>> Brian: It's almost that time of year and I'm talking to you thom brennaman, tv's biggest phenomenon. "Amerin idol" is back for an all-new season of talent and judges. America's number one show, "american idol" 
-- premieres this wednesday. 
>> Thom: Keith urban, I wish he'd tke time on every show and do a guitar solo. Play fake, it's the edged around to julio jones. And that did not fool leroy hill. K.J. Wright there as well. 

[02:28:42]


>> Brian: He did a nice job of chasing this down from behind. Branch keeps it from going to the outside, allows that rush from the back side to catch up to it. 
>> Thom: Wright another one of these young dynamic defenders. Only his second year out of mississippi state. They need one of these young, dynamic defenders to make a play. Trailing 27-14 and ryan throws it down the field. And it's intercepted! Or was it out of bounds? No, it is an interception a second straight week for earl thomas. You wonder about that decision by matt ryan. That had no chance of being caught. So we talked about a defender making a play. Seahawks get the ball back with 11:03 to go.Eyes, right here. This is our year. I thought it was last year... Turns out i was wrg. None of us would walk in here and settle. That's how we are! I forgot what I was going to say. Patrick, I want 100% commitment!

[ Male Announcer ] Bud Light. For the fans who do whatever it takes. Here we go. 
>> Thom: The takeaway by thomas and the seattle defense. Matt ryan, his second interception of the game, third time in his four postseason starts he's thrown two or more interceptions. Wilson looks down the field. Idney rice has it and steps out of bounds at the atlanta 38 yard line. 
>> Brian: Seattle continues to make hay with those deep to intermediate passes. Here rice just gets in behind that linebacker and second level of the secondary because of the play fake, becthe way they have to account for russell wilson. We've seen a number of plays hit at this level for big plays for the seattle seahawks. 
>> Thom:24-yard reception. Under 11:00 to go and they hand it off to lynch. Inside the 35 down to the 33. 
>> Brian: Thom, we have to go back to last year. An eerily similar play. Here earl thomas coming under pierre garcon in a bi play that helped turn the tide for the seattle seahawks against the washington redskins in the same fashion, earl thomas over the top coming up witthe big interception to give seattle a chance now inside the 50 to come away with another score. 

[02:33:10]


>> Thom: The crowd trying to get behind its falcons defense. Seattle on the move. Turbin cuts it back to the inside. Inside the and run out of bounds at the 3 yard line. How about the moves by the rookie out of utah state! And now with 9:42 to go. The seahawks inside the 5. 
>> Brian: Just a little dump-off here. You're going to see steven douglas, poor job of wrapping up. Just tryo take him out with just a hit. He needs to form tackle and wrap up to bring down robert turbin. Big mistake now going to put this falcon defense at risk inside the 5. 
>> Thom: Play action fake. Wide open, and an easy touchdown to zach miller. And don't look now, here come the seahawks. Russell wilson in seven of his 16 seattle games this year, his team had a chance to win with under 2:00 to go in the fourth quarter. They won four of those games. Three of them on touchdowns by wilson in wins over green bay, chicago and new england. And look at the numbers for wilson here in the second half. A stunned crowd in atlanta. It was 27-20. Now the falcons lead TO SIX.[ Male Announcer ] LISTEN, THIS CHEVY Silverado is not happy.

>> Thom: All of a sudden things have tightened up considerably here in atlanta. Four plays in under two minutes to go 62 yards after an interception. And the seahawks trail by six. What was a 20-point spread. Rodgers two yards out of his own end zone. And a good return. Up to the 24. 
>> Brian: Well, you're going to see here just zach miller is going to run a crossing route. He gets dropped in coverage. This happens on the goal line more often than not. Linebacker just doesn't recognize that he's got miller in behind him. This is a pretty easy throw for russell wilson to zach miller for the touchdown. 
>> Thom: So now the pressure clearly, as if it wasn't there already on this atlanta team to get a playoff win, this series a microcosm of the pressures that they have felt since being eliminated last year by the new york giants. Play action. Ryan, incomplete. 

[02:38:29]


>> Brian: Roddy white had beat richard sherman across the field. Matt ryan just a little bit off. That would have been a big play with a big chunk of yardage to punch a hole in it. Matt ryan is likely going to have to make the throws to get them going in this drive, because right now the running game has dried up just a little bit. 
>> Thom: Second down, they fake it one way and then they throw it to jones. And that was snuffed out beautifully by k.J. Wright. That's a loss back to the 20 yard line. Third down and 14 coming up. 
>> Brian: That's twice now that we've seen these quick screens blown up. First by chancellor, now by wright. They're all over it, doing a nice avoiding the pulling linemen to put atlanta in a third and 13 hole. 
>> Thom: Ryan steps up and pulling it down is bruce davis and look at that seattle sideline. Springing to its feet collectively after denying first down yardage, and the seahawks will get the football back. 
>> Brian: They're certainly not feeling that back-to-back cross-country flight now. They have been re-energized in the second half. Now it's going to fall on the atlanta defense to spark atlanta and keep seattle from marching right down the field like they did the last two times. 
>> Thom: Matt bosher stands at his own 12. Leon washington waiting at the 20. Very, very short punt. Savvy move by washon to come up and get it, and h brings it back to the 39 yard line. Boy, that is a rock saurld veteran play by washington. So now wilson with a chance to give his team the lead. everywhere. In our homes, our minds. We can share every second in data dressed as pixels.

>> Thom: What an amazing turn-around. Atlanta pitching a shutout in the opening half, had a 20-point lead here in the third quarter and now you're on the ropes. 
>> Brian: Yeah, this is the place the atlanta defense has got to step up. They have kind of clamped down on the run, but they may have to back off a little bit and let seattle run the ball a little bit. They can't afford these throws down the field anymore. 
>> Thom: They miss on a chance to sack the rookie wilson and he slides for a nine-yard gain on first down. We talked about the pressure on this atlanta team. Are they feeling it even more now, brian, on the sideline? 
>> Brian: Yeah, they are. We wondered how they would handle adversity early in the game. It's been atlanta up to this point. Now the adversity is coming late. We'll see how atlanta responds to that because that's where this history of losing the playoff games start to begin to creep in your mind. 
>> Thom: John abraham lost very early on reinjuring his ankle. Second down and it's lynch. Although he was hit right at the 50, that appears to be enough for a first down. Big hit by weatherspoon. Depending on the spot, we'll see whether or not he got a first down. We're waiting. And it is a first down. Lecheck in with ch myers. 

[02:44:09]


>> Chris: Russell wilson said he enjoys playing in a close game. Anybody can win in a blowout. Darrell bevell said if lunch doesn't run well we're not afraid to throw it 50 times with wilson. We have faith in him. It seems as the game gets tighter, the seahawk team gets even more loose. 
>> Thom: Play fake to lynch, and now wilson looks down the field and it is batted away. Closing quickly on sidney rice was DeCOUD. 
>> Brian: Where russell wilson makes his money deep down the field is just that kind of play, down the middle of the field. Not much of a streak or go thrower on the outside. Because of the play action fake they hope to move the safety. THERE thomas DeCoud wasn't moved enough and was able to recoup his position to knock the ball down. 
>> Thom: Second down and ten. Looking for the screen and sniffed out. Corey peters, a defensive lineman, tracking turbin out of the backfield and they tried to set up that screen. Look at the last three possessions, and more importantly the points. 
>> Brian: Where they have been making their most money is in that intermediate area between 15 and 20 yards. Now, that's going to be tougher because this defense is going to be jumping anything that goes deeper than the first down marker. But on first and second down, that's where that depth of route has hurt the atlanta falcons. 
>> Thom: And the falcons will ask for time-out. Third and one they couldn't convert, fourth and one gave it to michael robinson down inside the red zone. Couldn't get off the final play of the first half after wilson was sacked. They were out of time-outs. And they couldn't get -- forget about getting the field goal unit after the sack, they couldn't get off another snap. 

[02:46:31]


>> Brian: And if just one of those can convert and even just a field goal, that would currently make it a 27-24 game. Now you're talking about a three-point differential. That changes the entire dynamic of what you might call. 
>> Thom: Third and ten. Is zach miller the guy you're looking for? 
>> Brian: It has been. It was last week and has been a couple times today. 
>> Thom: By far the best game of his season for the seattle tight end. 
>> Brian: Zach miller on the left side. 
>> Thom: Three-man rush. And wilson looking for an open receiver. Flag down and rice dropped it. Now we wait on the penalty. 
>> Referee: Personal foul, chop block, number 60 on the offense. The penalty is declined. Fourth down. 
>> Thom: That's max unger, the all-pro center. 
>> Brian: Right here just on the outside making sure you can see here on the edge. They're not going to let russell wilson come around. Right there you saw max unger chop babineaux late in the play. That's a dangerous play with regard to injury, but a play in terms of making them punt. 
>> Thom: Big stop by this atlanta defense, and that punt is out of the end zone. Went beyond the goal line. 27-21 atlanta, 5:32 to go. Next sunday right here on fox, the nfc championship game. Will it be russell wilson? Will it be matt ryan playing at home? We'll know shortly. We also know begins at 2:00 eastern, next sunday. The nfc championship, only on fox. 

[02:48:46]


>> Brian: We're in a classic 4:00 territory even though we're sitting here at 5:32. What atlanta wants to do is buy down the clock, run the ball. Seattle knows that too. They're a tough big defense to run the ball against. Obviously atlanta has run the ball very well, but not so much in the second half. 
>> Thom: Well, they threw it three times on their last possession. Culminating on a matt ryan interception. Turner off the right side. And that's a gain of 12 for michael turner. Who's knocking on the door at a 100-yard rushing game. 
>> Brian: You've got to watch the feet of michael turner for a big man. Watch how he side steps this. He's got great feet for a big man with just enough acceleration to bounce to the outside. Just a little bit of a jump cut, and now those quick feet that belie a big man like michael turner. They're going to need a lot of him in this drive and they're not going to give the ball back to the seattle seahawks. 
>> Thom: Turner only has two 100-yard rushing games, the last coming the first week of november against dallas. Rodgers met at the line of scrimmage, picked up perhaps a yard. Red bryant there as the clock continues to roll, closing in on 4:30 to go. 
>> Brian: And matt ryan will orchestrate these huddle calls in a way that brings the clock down almost to just one or two seconds before he gets the snaps off. Right up here, here's the play clock. You can watch that as matt ryan will bring as much play clock down as he can, getting one more first down would be huge for this team. They want a lot more, but right now one more first down, just one first down at a time. 
>> Thom: The pitch by rodgers. What a job by the seattle defense. Browner the first man there to spin him around. So a very important, very important third down coming up. 

[02:50:57]


>> Brian: This comes out of the playbook from last year. This is a classic mike mularkey/pittsburgh steelers style of play with that quick flip to the bunch side. Seattle doing a nice job of holding up on the edge and not getting him outside. 
>> Thom: Well, this could be, could be the biggest down of the game. I mean obviously there have been scoring downs, scoring plays, but as you said, brian, they get a first down here and seattle is in a world of trouble. 
>> Brian: You always want to know where tony gonzalez is in this situation. 
>> Thom: Third down and eight. They need to get to the 42 yard line. And will not do it. Incomplete on a throw to roddy white, and once more matt ryan and the falcons offense cannot sustain a drive to put this game on ice. 
>> Brian: Matt needed to keep this throw a little high and outside. That's a tough catch, even for a roddy white. 
>> Thom: That's where he had to throw it, though, wasn't it? 
>> Brian: If he had kept it high and outside it would have been a lot easier. Obviously with a trailing defender, you don't want it to trail at all. High and outside woul have been safe and a little easier catch. 
>> Thom: Leon washington. Another very short punt by bosher, and washington up to the 49 yard line. That's where the last seahawks drive began. We invite you to stay tuned following our coverage here on fox from atlanta for the broken city postgame show. 
>> Brian: I want to see, again, if atlanta is going to take care of that intermediate area, that 12 to 20-yard area behind the linebackers in front of the free safety, because that's where seattle has been making their money. They didn't in the last series. I'd be surprised if they don't come back to it. 

[02:53:09]


>> Thom: A very, very quiet day for marshawn lynch. We said it a moment ago. Seven times this year seattle had a chance to win with under 2:00 to go in the fourth quarter. We're under 3:00 now. They won four of those seven games. Three of them against green bay, chicago and new england on russell wilson touchdowns. WILSON LOOKING AROUND.Ym The catch is made. Trying to get to the first down stick at the 49 yard line and it is very close, right on it. 
>> Brian: Change on that side. They did not, it looks like, and the chains are on that side. It's easy to see. They're going to let this thing come down to the 2:00 warning. 
>> Referee: That is the 2:00 warning. 
>> Thom:2:00 to go. Does russell wilson have a touchdown, game-winning touchdown drive in him? things one? 
[ All kids ] TWOOOOO! 
[ Moderator ] YOU SURE? I am absolutely positive!

>> Thom: Russell wilson this year the first rookie quarterback. Three game-winning touchdowns in the fourth quarter or overtime. Most since the merger in 1970. Can he do it here in the postseason. 2:00 to go in atlanta and seattle down by six. Wilson looking and he finds in the middle o the field golden tate, who spins off one tackle and has the first down to the 32 yard line. 
>> Brian: That's that intermediate area I'm talking about, in behind the linebackers. This is what has been killing atlanta of late. Nice job keeping it alive. Instead of scrambling, looking down the field, it is that 15 to 20-yard area that right now has been a real vulnerability for the atlanta falcons. 

[02:57:34]


>> Thom: Under 1:30. Wilson a pump fake, looking and now he'll run it. He dives ahead to the 27 and quickly try to get his team up to the line of scrimmage. Three time-outs remaining, 1:10 to go. One can only wonder what is going through the mind of mike smith right now. 
>> Brian: They're huddling up. Yeah, I don't know why. At the very least use one of those time-outs. They have got three of them. They let a lot of clock run off in that series. 
>> Thom: There's 56 left. Wilson down the middle, and it's incomplete. Threw it in between MILLER and McCoy. His two tight ends. 
>> Brian: Now on third down if they don't convert here, you're in that distance where you could think field goal, onside kick, but I don't think that's going to be the case. I think you're in four-down territory here unless of course you get sacked. It's likely four down territory. 
>> Thom: Blitz coming. Wilson escapes a tackle. Will get the first down and then some. He's run out of bounds at the 5 yard line, the ball at the 4 yard line. 34 seconds remain. 
>> Brian: Russell wilson escaping to the outside and just dropping it off to marshawn lynch. Look, they bring the pressure and now just the athleticism of stepping away. That had sack written all over it. With sean weatherspoon almost getting home to russell wilson. 

[02:59:40]


>> Thom: Ball inside the 4. 
>> Brian: He has yet to pull the ball out in the read option and keep it. 
>> Thom: Timeout is called. A flag down, I beg your pardon. A penalty flag down.

The nutribullet's high-powered motor with bullet-exclusive cyclonic action breaks down and pulverizes food on a cellular level, opening up their hidden nutritional value that can reverse the effects of aging and supercharge your metabolism to fight off aches and pains, colds and flus, and even improve vital heath markers like cholesterol levels and blood pressure.

[00:02:00]


>> Greetings, everybody. I'm david wolfe. Welcome to my workshop. Today we're gonna talk about nutrition. Why? I'll tell you why. Because over the last 30 years, we've become the most overfed yet undernourished nation in the entire world. This has created an epidemic of high blood pressure, obesity, depression, stress and a whole lot more. That's why I'm so excited to bring you a machine that's going to change your life the way it changed my life. This is the nutribullet, the world's first nutrition extractor. A nutrition extractor is not a blender, it's not a juicer. It's completely different from anything else out there. This machine is designed to break down the cell walls of your food, releasing, unleashing the nutrients inside, transforming ordinary fresh foods into superfoods. Now I'm gonna show you the difference between smoothies from a traditional blender and what we can create with my nutribullet. Let me show you what I'm talking about. O.K., We're gonna put kale in for chlorophyll and fiber. We're gonna take some pineapple for the vitamin c and a little bit of flavor. We're gonna put in some cucumbers, great for hydration, great for the kidneys, put in some cashews for the creaminess and the protein. And of course we're gonna add some flax seeds in to get the omega-3 fatty acids. And then we're gonna add spring water. Let's get the lid on there. Put on the extractor blades onto our nutribullet. Are you ready? 
>> Audience: Ready! 
>> Look, this blender is just mixing stuff around-- it's not breaking anything down. But the nutribullet with its 600 watts of compact power and bullet-exclusive cyclonic action combined with the specially designed extractor blades turning at an amazing 10,000 R.P.M.s PULVERIZING THE CELL Walls, unlocking all that hidden nutrition so your body can actually absorb it and use it. Now, I've got a strainer here, we're gonna pour our blended smoothie through and see what is left over. What's gonna make it through? We've got unbroken flax seeds, lots of fiber... Here, let me show you this. This, ladies and gentlemen, is what we call a smoothie. 

[00:04:55]


[Audience exclaims] now let's see what happened with the nutribullet. I take off the extractor blades, looks like we've got quite a beverage in here. Let's bring it out and pour it through the strainer. It's completely liquefied. All that nutrition has been turned inside out. Everything's been completely broken down. And when we pour it, we can see just how glowing it is, beautiful. The real test is always the flavor. Let's give it a try. That, ladies and gentlemen, is what I call a nutriblast. We've taken all of those cells, pulverized them, flipped them inside out, got all of that juice, all the nutrients-- the vitamins, the minerals, the enzymes, the essential fatty acids, the protein-- and now we can actually assimilate and utilize those nutrients. We've turned this into a superfood. Listen, juicers makes juice and blenders make smoothies, but the nutribullet makes nutrient-packed nutriblasts. All I'm asking you to do is have one nutriblast a day and that will transform your life. 
>> About five years ago the doctor told me after taking my cholesterol numbers that I was gonna have to be on cholesterol medication and most likely for the rest of my life. We tried to address it with diet, we tried to address it with exercise and neither of them seemed to work. There is a history of heart disease in my family. There's a history of high cholesterol in my family, so I felt this was the natural progression of things and it was out of my control, that there was nothing that i could do, until I went onto this nutribullet system, and that's when things really started to change dramatically. When I make my nutriblasts incorporating the nutribullet, it emulsifies fruits and vegetables so well that I el them go right into my system, I feel those ingredients immediately, and I started to see results actually within three or four days. Six weeks ago when I started this program, I weighed 182 pounds, and after six weeks on the nutribullet program, I believe I weighed in at 160. So this weight loss over six weeks is just a byproduct. The reason that I involved myself in the nutribullet program was for cholesterol purposes, to reduce my cholesterol, to regain control of my life and to get rid of the acid reflux. My starting cholesterol was 263 and now I'm at 208 and within a normal range. And my triglycerides are almost cut in half. Look at my results over six weeks. If I can enjoy these results, I have to think that everybody can. 

[00:07:42]


>> When we think of hormone imbalance, we think that's only something that happens to older people... And that's nonsense. This can affect any of us at any age-- in our teens, IN OUR 20s, IN OUR 70s-- And hormone imbalance leads to mood swings, infertility, acne, fatigue, low sex drive, and those things can affect any of us. The emphasis here is on hormones. And both men and women are affected by this. We're not built the same, so the approach has to be a little bit different, so what we've done here is we've created a nutriblast for the guys and a nutriblast for the gals. 
>> Great. >> Wonderful. 
>> There are so many amazing hormone-building foods. Foods like beets, grapes, blueberries, pumpkin seeds, broccoli to support the prostate, olive oil, which helps keep good hormones from becoming bad hormones. We need good hormones to keep us young. We've got to put in spring water. Let's put on the extractor blades. We're set. Over here we have a female nutriblast, and this contains some key different ingredients. We've put in arugula, sometimes called rocket, we've added raspberries for their volatile oils, which help to support female reproductive health, we've added avocado and goji berries, one of the best antioxidants on the planet. Are we ready to blast off? 
>> Audience: We're ready. 
>> Look at the power! Look at the bullet-exclusive cyclonic action. The nutribullet is pulverizing these ingredients. All right... Let's see what we got. 

[00:09:46]


>> Woman: Mmm, love the colors. 
>> Remove the extractor blades. Here it is, coming down e counter. For the ladies, let's give that a try. >> Yeah. 
>> If you have a nutriblast every day, you're gonna look better, you're gonna feel better, you canlive longer and you willlove longer. 
>> My hot flashes started when I was 35 years old, and through the years they have just progressively gotten worse, where there's times in the middle of the night you just feel like you're being microwaved.But after doing some nutriblasts for the first week, I slept better, I felt more rested, I didn't have a hot flash. I am thrilled to death by the change in my health and how I feel. It's the combination of the fruits, the vegetables and all the vitamins that arall being emulsified together... It works. 
>> The anti-depressants, the sleeping pills and the blood pressure medication did help in the beginn but as in long-term, it wasn't helping. Well, within a week of drinking nutriblast I saw incredible changes. Right now I'm sleeping a solid eight hours, I am no longer taking my sleeping pills, and nutribullet has everything to do with that. 
>> I was diagnosed with fibromyalgia. It's extremely painful. You're in pain a lot of the time. When I started using the nutribullet, I was pleasantly surprised because the first night that I actually used the nutribullet, I actually slept really well. That was exciting. That was phenomenal. It's almost unbelievable, quite frankly, that just by using the nutribullet and just properly nourishing your body that I got immediate results and a result that I was looking for. If I had to pick one kitchen appliance that I absolutely had to have, it would be the nutribullet. It is the only appliance out there that can give me exactly what my body needs in order to feel good, um, have the health and proper nutrition that is so important in order for us to be able to just live life. 

[00:11:59]


[Emotionally] if the people were here that made the nutribullet, what I would say to them is thank you for giving me my life back, thank you for allowing me to enjoy my family more... Thanks for taking away the pain. Where have you been all my life? [Laughs] 
>> we all know how important the immune system is. It is the key. Your immune system determines what belongs and what doesn't. When it finds something bad, it releases white blood cells, and white blood cells detoxify our body. They also help us fight illness, pain, even disease. Our ability to create and release white blood cells is affected by a lot of things. It's affected by a lack of sleep, stress, it's especially affected by a lack of nutrition. If we can increase our absorption from our food and nourish our immune system directly, then our bodies can handle practically anything. The nutribullet is designed to help us do just that. 
>> For the past two years, I haven't been very healthy. Unfortunately I was diagnosed with cancer. So, for the past two years, I haven't been very healthy and I've been feeling overall pretty crummy. Lost every ounce of my hair-- I lost every hair on my head and then I just covered my head up with wigs, but, you know, at the end of the day when you're taking your wig off and you have to see the result of the chemotherapy, it's really hard, you know, on your psyche. I was amazed at how quickly I saw results from the nutribullet. I was so excited, because to feel it after the second nutriblast was a miracle to me. I was so excited. One of the best things about the nutribullet is that it's not a blender. It's something that pulverizes everything that you put in it and you're extracting the nutrients out of these whole foods, so you're getting the maximum benefit by everything that you're putting in there. And probably about three weeks into the program, my hair just went through this growth spurt, and people were asking me, you know, what happened, because I didn't have a whole lot of hair before I started. I was just telling somebody, I started this year off fighting for my life... I'm ending the year feeling better than I've felt in years. Totally given me hope, you know, and I didn't have that and I just feel wonderful... 

[00:14:23]


[Emotionally] and I am so grateful for everything you've done-- thank you so much, from the bottom of my heart. You guys are awesome and I hope that this can help other people. 
>> One of the greatest keys to bolstering your immune system is hidden inside the foods that we buy every day. What we have to do is unlock those valuable nutrients so that we can actually absorb them. This can help change your life. In fact, it could actually help save your life. 
>> Announcer: Over the last 30 years, we have become the most overfed yet undernourished nation on the planet, leading to a modern-day epidemic of obesity, high blood pressure, stress, depression and more. We're not getting healthier, we're getting sicker, and it comes down to one simple need: Nutrient absorption. We need to increase the nutritional power of the foods we eat every day to dramatically change the way we look and feel... And the great news is now we can! From the makers of the original magic bullet, introducing the nutribullet, the superfood nutrition extractor. With the nutribullet, you can turn ordinary food into superfood that now absorbs easily into your body's system so you can live a longer, healthier, more active life. All this food is loaded with essential nutrition, and the only way to get all of it is to break down, pulverize and open up the food's hidden nutrition on a cellular level. This process is called nutrition extraction. 
Look: Even expensive blenders just mix things around, they don't break things down, and with juicing, most of the valuable nutrition and fiber is just thrown away. But the nutribullet is different-- watch. Start with some spinach for fiber, banana for potassium, add some berries for essential antioxidants, then almonds and flax seeds for omega-3 oils, add a little water, and watch how the power of the nutribullet completely breaks everything down, extracting all the essential nutrition. Look, even the almonds and flax seeds have been broken down to fit through this strainer, unlike traditional blenders that leave everything behind. The secret of the nutribullet is its powerful 600-watt motor, combined with bullet-exclusive cyclonic action that forces everything through the turbo extractor blades turning at an incredible 10,000 r.P.M. To break down and pulverize the stems, seeds, and skins, where most of the essential nutrition lies, taking ordinary fresh foods and turning them into superfoods to give you the strength, energy and vitality for a full active life, whatever your age. Juicers make juice, blenders make smoothies, but the nutribullet makes supercharged, superfood nutriblasts, and by drinking just one nutriblast a day, you can supercharge your body, lower cholesterol, lower blood pressure, and superboost your energy levels to feel better than you have in years, without taking prescription pills, without any side effects. Just one a day can change your life. We've all bought expensive blenders and juicers and we all know the problem: They're just too much trouble to put together, and clean them once and you'll never want to clean th again, but the nutribullet takes seconds to use and seconds to clean.

Watch: Just load your ingredients into the cup, twist on the extractorlade, pop it onto the power base, and watch how the nutribullet blasts ordinary foods into superfoods in an instant, then just separate, throw in the dishwasher or give it a quick rinse and you're ready to go again in seconds.

>> inflammation in our joints and in our bodies has become a huge problem. Anyone who suffers from arthritis or joint pain knows exactly what I'm talking about. I bet most of you believe that once that pain starts, it just gets worse and worse, right? 
>> Audience: Right. 
>> Wrong. There are foods that contain hidden nutrients that can give your body the tools it needs to help fight the effects of arthritis and joint pain. This nutriblast contains the vitamin c brothers-- lemon and lime-- the anti-inflammatory enzyme bromelain, found in grapefruit and pineapple, apples with their malic acid, which cuts right into arthritis, the anti-inflammatory omega-3 inside the flax seeds, and my personal favorite, turmeric. Turmeric is probably the most powerful anti-inflammatory food you can find in your local grocery store. You ready to try this? 

[00:22:07]


>> Woman: Yes. 
>> You just make and you drink. So easy. So let's give it a try. 
>> Woman: O.K. 
>> Wow, that's powerful. I don't know if you guys know this, but both my parents are medical doctors. My mom told me that health is our greatest asset. 
>> Woman: Absolutely. 
>> So, let's toast to the best health ever-- cheers. 
>> Bravo. >> Cheers. 
>> I've had migraines most of my life where, um, there's times where just keeping my eyes open is, is very painful. Um, basically, being put in a dark room, laying in a bed with your eyes closed would be the only relief I would get from a migraine. Once a week I would suffer from a migraine. Since incorporating the nutriblast I haven't had one headache, not one migraine. The nutribullet is different because it extracts all the nutrients from the fruits and vegetables and nuts, and I think everybody should do it because you just feel great. I've never felt this good in my life, never. Never. 
>> Ladies and gentlemen, we all know that what we eat is important, but how we eat it may even be more important. If you're eating healthy, good-for-you salads, you might only be absorbing a fraction of the available nutrition. By making the amazing nutrition contained at the cellular level of these foods available to you, you'll absorb them, and then you'll feel a huge difference in how you look and you'll feel a huge difference in your day-to-day energy. You can take everyday, ordinary foods and turn them into superfoods in literally seconds with the nutribullet. All I'm asking you to do is have just one nutriblast a day and I promise you it can change your life. Thanks so much for being here. Have the best day ever. Cheers! All right!

The metropolitan area of for just about every kind of music. My mother was playing sinatra, tony bennett, sarah vaughn, so i was exposed to all of those singers when I was 10 or 11 years old. It floored me. I just thought it was so beautiful. Then when I went to high school, I got exposed to rhythm- and-blues. I found all this stuff and it was an epiphany for me to discover where pop music really came from. I became so immersed in it that when I was 15, I started doing it professionally. ??????

And andrew hsu placed schumann. To talented young musicians trained by the legendary pianist and teacher gary graf men. 
     ??????
>> jenny worked with elmer sokolov for many years. She asked if I could take her for a year, which turned out to be two years before she graduated. She is a very talented. I am glad to be working with her a bit. After eleanor, that is 90% of the preparation for her. 
  ??????
>> the the beethoven sonata she was working on this year, which some people refer to as number 28, I have to figure this out because I know the by the opus numbers. Usually, they are played by older people. But it's a very good idea to already start to work on these things that the underage so that when you are in your middle 20s and older than that, you come back to it for a second or third time and at the figures have already done all of the work. So that comes automatically. Then everything you have learned and lived through during those years then can be expressed. 

[00:02:05]


Some people say they're young people shouldn't play something of that sort. Maybe they shouldn't play it in carnegie hall. But I get a very good idea to start early.

[applause] >> andrew hsu is one of three talented young pianist, his older sister and younger brother, all of them are at curtis. It is a special kind of talent. I thought since he thinks in architectural things, which many young people don't think about at all, playing the notes and if they are talented, they are inspired and so forth. He was analytical. I thought I would suggest that some point that he studied conducting as well. He was of that kind of mind. Maybe he will, but in addition, and more important, he is very talented as a composer which i did not know at first. I know that now, of course. 
  ??????
he played the schumann fantasy, one of the most profound and profoundly difficult works. It requires the ability to make time stand still. 

[00:26:40]


When played it marvelously, it doesn't sound that way. It was quite remarkable. Technically, it's difficult.

>> The academy bus pulled up for the fooirms the kids paraded and walked up to us they have never seen anything as magnificent as this. 
>> It is life changing for these children to have an opportunity to come to a school like this that has computers, that has good quality teachers and get a good education. 
>> Nice to meet you. Again nice to meet you. 
>> These are our neighbors. These are great kids. We want them to be the best they can be. ???????????? 
>> young haitians got a chance at a new and better life. A 2010 earthquake that killed 300,000 people left many haitian children without parents and without homes. This enormous humanitarian crisis left reverend graham of samaritan's purse in over drive to help. They wanted a safe place where orphaned children can live. My husband john and I wanted to help, too. In 2015, 2012 the academy opened and we were all there to cut the ribbons. 
>> This is your new home. ???????????? 
>> take a look behind me. This is where the kids are all playing. This was absolutely nothing two years ago. And because of the work and contributions of many of you samaritan's purse all of y reverend graham they have this magnificent facility. Greta hullman academy. They have everything here. 
-- Greta home and academy. They have everything here. 

[00:04:12]


>> My name is mark. Nice to meet you. 
>> Nice to meet you. 
>> These kids come out of some of the greatest poverty not only in the western hemisphere but in the world and to be able to give them a chance, to give them an education we want to be able to teach every kid a basic trade. 
(Speaking foreign language) you can say hello or hi any time. In the morning, at noon, in the afternoon. Hello. 
(Speaking foreign language) ???????????? 
>> they even have lap top computers here that helps them grow. It helps them be a part of the world. These kids have an opportunity they never would have in a million years had. 
>> I am very excited to go to greta home and academy. I hope we don't break anything, we don't make mamas angry. 
>> I want their dreams to come true. I don't want them to not be able to fulfill their dreams due to lack of education, lack of skill sets, lack of being able to have a dream. We want to instill that future in each of them that they can accomplish whatever they set out to do. Housing, education, jobs, what other challenges does haiti still face? Can a small nation make a comeback? Reverend graham what are the bigs obstacles facing haiti today? 

[00:06:14]


>> No question, it's the government. The government tries, but there's so much corruption at every level. The best thing when we were in haiti right after the earthquake was when the 82nd airborne came f in. For a few months they were the government and you could get things done. They need government that has authority. 
>> Is there any sense of infrastructure. We have roads, we have police. You get a sense there's any infrastructure there? 
>> There's infrastructure. You do see some improvements after the earthquake, so many of the roads were destroyed. They have come back to some degree. You would be driving along on asphalt all of a sudden there's a section of road that hasn't been paved. The earthquake hasn't been fixed yet. The haitian people are not lazy. They are hard-working people. They need an opportunity, they need a chance. 
>> Is there an educational system? Are there stoplights? Is there a fire department? Any of those things? 
>> Occasionally you will see a policeman maybe directing traffic. No, they don't have a lot of it. They do have an education system. It is inadequate. It is something the schools have not reopened after the earthquake. But in three years we have seen improvement in haiti. There are a few bright spots. 
>> Obviously it's a very different situation now than it was in the immediate aftermath of the quake. You don't have destroyed buildings every where. You don't have thank god bodies in the street. But if you are really talking about the long-term things that are necessary in order for people in haiti to have better lives stronger institutions and more resilient state those things are no better today than they were three years ago. The counn many ways are where they were in the same condition it was before the earthquake. 

[00:08:17]


>> Right after the earthquake the entire country was literally in chaos. Every building over one story was demolished the roads were demolished. There has been a lot of progress but it is slow. 
>> How do you describe it today? 
>> You have to remember the background in haiti. Before the earthquake haiti was the poorest country in the western hemisphere. 30 percent of the population had access to electricity. Probably less than 5 percent of the roads were considered what we would say as good. You look at where they are today there are ways to improve. There has been progress but a lot of frustration, too. 
>> When I was there with you in december to travel from the airport to greta home and academy is how many miles? 15 miles. 
>> Took us how many days? 
>> On a good day you can make it in two hours. 
>> There is something wrong there? 
>> There is definitely something wrong. On the roads you were riding on it will look good for a couple run yards and then a couple00 yards of missing road. That's something the government hasn't been able to make long-term improvements in the infrastructure those things that are the foundation of faungsing government, society where people can be healthy and prosper. 
>> There is always a chance things could improve. They are not improving right now. The same mistakes that were made before the earthquake that made the conditions so bad during the earthquake are still present. There aren't signs of those things changing. 
>> Port-au-prince, that's the capitol it seems so dysfunctional when you are in port-au-prince. There is some improvements in some part of the city but it is still a basket case. The haitian people need help. These are nzy people. They are hard-working people. They need a little help. We want to continue to help the people and I want to do it in jesus' name in god's son's name. Do the best we can for them. We can make a difference. I can't help the whole country but we can help a few greta. That's what I want to zero in on. I want to show god the love that I can take care of. What are the few obstacles? 

[00:10:48]


>> Looking at the long range things the infrastructure items that help society prosper for a long time. Haiti had a history of that for years. We first went in and occupied haiti from 1915 to 1934. We have had u.S. Forces back again after president aristide left back in 2004. We had a history of nonfunctioning governments or governments functioning to benefit themselves rather than the people. 
>> Do you have a sense that haiti can rebuild itself? Not only rebuild itself from the earthquake but rebuild itself from decades of squalor and lack of infrastructure do you have a sense of optimism? 
>> I think it can occur. It will be a slow process it takes dedication and a lot of help from partner groups and nongovernment tal organizations and international governments u.S. Forces are still there. But the potential is there. If you look at the other side of the aisle you can see what the potential could be for haiti. There are dock climbs in haiti. Who ever heard of a cruise ship going to haiti. It will has to be helped. 
>> Part of it has to do with interference from the outside over the years and also the functions of the state and functions that would ordinarily be provide by pubcations and even by private haitian agencies supplanted by organizations and governments on the other side. That has been a problem for haiti for decades and been a huge problem since the earthquake and still a problem today. 
>> We can't judge haiti's progress. Where were they? Poorest country in the western hemisphere. It has a long way to go. 
>> Shocking scenes the devastation around port-au-prince is visible even in december 2010 almost one year after the mass I have earthquake struck that is when on the record took an aeriel tour along with franklin graham and alaskan governor sarah palin. 

[00:12:59]


>> It is a beautiful country and also beautiful people here. It is unfortunate they have had the kind of problems they have had. This is one of the places in the world that didn't have congress. The united nations brought it in. 
>> It was recently imported to this country. 
>> It was (inaudible). 
>> It spread like wildfire. 
>> You are talking close to 600,000 infections is what they are estimating. 
>> Where are we headed right now? 
>> Coming on the west side of port-au-prince. They just at it about 10:00. The runway has been there since 100. You can see the open green area. We are coming up on the port area on the west side of port-au-prince. 
>> This is what we call city sole lay in here. It is one huge slum. 
>> Look at that. Actually it looks like 
(inaudible). 
>> They have this park right here at 10:00. This is where all of our stuff comes in. See all of the lumber sitting down at 10:00. 
>> That is your lumber? 
>> All of that is ours. 
>> That's where they come in. This port up here is the main port. You can see the containers coming up. You those are all in the water. The main port is this next area. The runway is probably just out there back there towards the left 7:00 out there. 
>> (Inaudible). 
>> The problem is not getting it in, it's once you get it here it's customs. 
>> They just want us to be up right. 
>> What about food shipments? 
>> Medicines same thing. 
>> What do they want? What are they asking for? 

[00:15:00]


>> Tens of thousands of dollars. Now, the (inaudible) will be on the governor's side. Point out to her what we are looking at. 
>> After the ethquake a little bit to our right the port-au-prince got hammered very, very strongly. Part of the problem as you can see out to the right see how everything is stacked on top of each other. It's just -- it's -- that's the stadium you will be. 
>> See the stadium. That's where I will be preaching in january. 
>> You see it has been here a year almost and there's just stuff every where. 
>> People are still living in these villages. 
>> Not many. Not many. But all of the shanties beside them are putting them up outside of their house so they can keep track of it to keep it from getting flooded on. 
>> That is right below us. 
>> That was the hotel? 
>> That was the montana. 
>> What about security after dark? 
>> That's not very good. 
>> What does not very good mean? 
>> It means the police kind of hide to be honest with you. When the riots started the police just kind of hid. This is downtown right here. This looks terrible. Nothing has been done. It is nothing but rubble. You can't tell that anything has been done. There is the palace right there. 
>> All of these blue tarps are these displaced people? 
>> Yes. 
>> This is the middle of the city and look at all of the displaced people. 
>> Most of those blue tarps are ours. 
>> Can you image living in there? Look at that church cathedral to the left. 
>> This is the catholic church. I think the archbishop was killed. 

[00:17:03]


>> Yes. 
>>> Down below us to the right look at that. 
>> Oh my goodness. 
>> (Inaudible). Look where sara is at. Pis and piles. There it is. That's the church there. 
>> Straight ahead immediately after the quake the world rushed in to help. But is haiti getting any international support now? That's next. On to a deadly epidemic wreaking havoc on haiti after the quake hit. Cholera taking thousands of lives. Is cholera still a threat today? The lathes coming up. 
>> I would never stop saying thank you for the beautiful things you are doing and they are doing in my life. I know god is going to protect me that's why I am praying god every day so we can have this beautiful thing happen in our lives. ?????? ?????? ??????

[00:21:45]


>> We've been hit very hard and had an excellent meeting with the president and the prime minister and they were very specific about what they're trying to achieve. Clearly their highest obligation is to get the necessities to the people who are living to clear the streets of the corpses, the very tragic job that has to be done and to begin working on the electricity, the transportation,he telecommunications, now, the nuts and bolts how they get up and going again. 
>> Greta: That was secretary of state hillary clinton speaking to "on the record" right on the airport tarmac in haiti and that interview just six days after the 7.0 earthquake hit. Now, immediately after the deadly january 2010 quake, the international community rushing in to help the devastated nation. But what about now? Is there any help or hope left? What is the international community doing and how do you define the international community? 
>> First of all, you have the governments from other countries, united states, france, the european union, people like that, groups like that that are working and that have taken specific projects and jobs that they are focused on. Then you have ngo, nongovernmental organizations like samaritan's purse and many others, that take smaller areas and focus on them. We focused on rubble removal, we focused on rebuilding, or providing temporary shelter for people, people were sleeping out on the roads after the earthquake. People had no place to go so we bought -- we built 15,000 temporary shelters and took care of 75,000 people able to get out of the rain and mud and we focused on the cholera epidemic and were you a huge help, greta you allowed me to speak to the issue, we could not get ringers lactate to save the lives of people and could not get it until you put the spotlight on it. 
>> Greta: Why couldn't you get it? 
>> The united states government has supplied the ringers lactate to the hatian government and their ministry of health had it. We were not part of the ministry of health and would not give it to the ngo's, only saving it for themselves, but they were not taking care of cholera patients at that time. So, here you had a warehouse full of this material, this iv fluid that would save the life of these people, but we were one of the few groups in haiti that were actually taking care of the cholera epidemic. So, it was one of those things you put a spotlight on it greta, it was a huge help. And there was, you know, fox news has done a great job giving the spotlight. Other news organizationsave put a spotlight on haiti. We need to continue to help haiti. It's just a few hours off our shore and if we don't help them solve their problems, they'll come to hurricane by the boat loads. 

[00:24:38]


>> Greta: How about the international community? Are they still aggressively helping and are they showing, a good contribution, one that's leading to success? 
>> This is the thing, it's a mixed bag. Right, because you have organizations that come in and maybe into the small area where they work, a small community or small subject area, they're able to make some kind of progress. Unfortunately, often times that progress isn't going to last, that group, or outlast that group's exit from the country. But the real issue is that often times, when the responders are coming in, they end up doing more harm than good. One good example that's been discussed here and elsewhere, is the cholera epidemic. It's killed nearly 8,000 people in haiti. It's spread to the dominican republic, to cuba and there have been cases all over the region, and that's a disease that all evidence shows was brought to the country by united nations peacekeepers. Who were there ostensibly to help, ostensibly to keep the peace and help maintain political stability, but ironically, they ended introducing the contagion that created the tragedy that so many responds who came after the earthquake said that they were trying to avoid, which was the massive outbreak of it disease. 
>> I think the international community has done a lot in haiti, particularly ngo's, it's been three years now and seeing an exodus of ngo's in there in large measure and pulling out now. So it's on the down slide, I'd say on the amount of international activities and u.N. Forces are present, more than a peace keeping, watching mode, not doing anything particularly active. Three years later it's hard to sustain momentum on any international effort at that amount of time. 
>> Greta: Coming up, america's doctors and nurses saving lives in haiti. Medical professionals headed to haiti right after the quake and stayed long after. Why should you care so much about haiti? Those answers next. Also, we're going to take you back inside the greta home and academy. You'll see how 80 hatian children are being educated and learning to love school. That's coming up. ??? ??????

So jill can keep living the good life. Crest. Life opens up when you do. 
>> And five days, six days after the earthquake itself and we have had doctors here around the clock, I think 20 hours a day operating well into the night so we're able to bring personnel in, you can still see behind me probably 200 people waiting and some of them will die tonight, no question the next hour, we're working as hard as we can. 
>> Greta: And can't get more dire tn that, more than 300,000 people killed in the earthquake in haiti and 300,000 more hurt. And hundreds of american doctors and medical personnel travel to go haiti to help save lives. So why does haiti matter to you and to america? 
>> Why should the americans be concerned about haiti? There are lots of places in the world to worry about and even home to worry about, why haiti? 
>> First, the geographic proximity. Right next door to haiti and we have historical ties to haiti, to the government, and many ties between american citizens and haiti. But most importantly, it's right there and the problems, if we don't help he solve the problems in haiti, they will come to america. Because we are, we've seen the migration of people in bad times in haiti trying to come into the united states. So we are best served by creating a system and helping the hatian government to solve the problems they have. 

[00:31:20]


>> Greta: Why should americans care about haiti? We have problems here and around the world and that's the question I always get asked. 
>> There's a couple of things and I've heard often when the question is asked is haiti's proximity to the united states and that's true. Another thing to consider, haiti's problems don't act in a vacuum. The united states has been involved in haiti since the beginning. And haiti is the second oldest and united states the first. And they've had a relationship often acrimonious. Involved occupation by haiti, involved invasions by the united states in haiti. Not everything the united states has done there has been good. One example is that the united states has overseen the implementation of food policy in haiti, that involves the importation of heavily subsidized american grain, especially rice, which is undercut hatian farmers and put a lot of hatian families out of business and worsened poverty there. It's not like we can just sit back and say, oh, this isn't really our problem, this is their problem, they need to fix it because we've been involved all along in good as well as in bad and it's not like we can just choose to disengage when things aren't going so well there. We've been involved, we're still involved. There isn't a choice in the matter the only question, do we want to be a force for good or be something else. 
>> Greta: We traveled in armored cars, was that overkill or-- 
>> you're precious cargo, it wasn't overkill. 
>> Is it dangerous for americans? 
>> Depends where you are, the government, a lot of instability, a lot of violence and corruption, police corruption has occurred in places, so when you're travelling in haiti. Your concerned about safety. Particularly when you get off the main thoroughfares, when the sun goes down, because it's a society where the police force is not that active, it's not really present very much outside of the main cities. 
>> But the state department recently issued a travel advisory which it did for many americans, and haiti caught my attention. 
>> They drecently reduced the travel advisory, I think a wise precaution by the state department. Again, there's been improvements in haiti and the president's government has been taking active steps to improve the safety and security in the country, but it's still a dangerous place to be. 

[00:33:35]


>> The problems aren't solved in haiti, sooner or later they're going to get in boats like I've seen in the past and come to our shores one way or another. So, let's help haiti solve their problems. The hatian people, everybody li come to america, but everybody loves their own home and hatians love haiti and if we can help solve their political problems, that they would stay. 
>> And aren't they spectacular beautiful places in haiti. People never been there, absolutely gorgeous. 
>> Haiti is a spectacularly beautiful country and the name comes from the word, old native word for a mountainous place. It has soaring peaks, basically the highest mountains in the caribbean are on the island of hispanola. There are beautiful beaches. In the north, there's the citadel, and it's the world heritage sight, originally a fortress built to propel attacks from the the french, but on itself, magnificent castles on top of a the mountain, it's a beautiful country. Gorgeous. 
>> Greta: What does haiti need? I guess operating government. Anything else it needs? 
>> I think it needs to develop. It's got the resources there, that's the conundrum. You look at haiti and the resources, the lush terrain, the beaches, our compound where we worked with samaritan's purse in haiti, we're on the beach and sit and eat your meal ten yards from the water and I wouldn't put the my toe more would i. The government has no sewer system and the that's drain into the bay. We can't help them. We can help individuals in haiti. We can't fix the haiti government. We can't correct their problems. The government of haiti has to be developed and focused on the long-term effort. 
>> I don't think you realize it's so hot there you drink a lot of water and people drinking out of plastic bottles and chuck it, it ends up in the sewer system, it clogs everything up, I know that the samaritan's purse and reverend graham had to pay to retrieve those bottles to get them out of there, the drains, so there'd be less sewage stopped up. Horrible, never ending cycle. 

[00:35:54]


>> One great program is our recycling program. We set up entrepreneurs, they pay and collect a group of businessmen working with them, they go out and gather the plastic and we bring it into a central facility and bundle and bail it with the machines we have and take it to the recycling center. In just 2012, almost $100,000 to the hatian economy by paying the people involved in this program so we helped make their lives better and shod them what it was like to be an entrepreneur. What it was like to take care of their family. What it was like to involve the community in this effort. And the end result was cleaning up haiti, a huge problem. 
>> Greta: And on the same land mass is the dominican republic. A vastly different country y do you think the difference between the dominican republic on one side of the land mass and haiti on the other. They look very different. One is prosperous and one is truly a country in crisis. 
>> It's just the government, greta, no question. And haiti had a dictator, and you could go right on down the line of these corrupt political leaders that have been in the country that have taken advantage of the hatian people. Now, for a little over a century. They need america's involvement, no question, we need to be there and help the hatian people. But I just wish that the united states government would get involved in even a bigger way and help them administratively. We did this to iraq. How come we can't help them and do this in haiti by actually putting them up, a military administrative, somebody to go in and actually help run the country. Set the systems back in place and turn it over to the hatian people and when every system is up and running. It can be done, we did it in iraq. 
>> Greta: Coming up after the earth stopped shaking, the people oaiti facing another giant and deadly threat. Cholera. The latest on the epidemic. Plus, our tour of a samaritan's purse cholera clinic for children. That's next and so many children left without parents and left without homes. Now, a fresh start for dozens of haiti's children. You'll hear from the executive director of the greta home and academy coming up. .

>> This is where a number of women are cleaning their clothes and I can't emphasize enough how serious the water problem is here in haiti for cholera. So you can imagine how we take a look at this and we see them washing clothes that are dirty in the water, and we see people drinking this water. And they're working hard here, the the hatians to get their clothes clean, but this is not exactly an ideal situation. If you notice that they wash their feet. Take baths in the water and wash their clothes and the children here, and the children don't wear diapers and sort of adds to the problem because a lot of the cholera is from situations where the bacteria from being passed around through the water. But this is a country in great need. And so, different, so vastly different from what it could be. It's a beautiful country. Haiti could be beautiful, haiti could be prosperous, but terrible unrest, terrible violence and now this cholera epidemic. 
>> Greta: Cholera, one of the biggest threats to the hatian peop since the earthquake. The cholera outbreak erupted in october, 2010 and it's been widely blamed on the camp of u.N. Peacekeepers from nepal. It killed thousands. So is cholera still a problem today? 
>> We've traveled to haiti and seen the cholera clinic you had up and running a couple of years ago and it looked like the cholera, a horrible epidemic, people lost their lives and very sick. That seemed to be on the road to elimination, but is it back? Is cholera back? 
>> It is greta, but not like it was, it's being contained in some of the rural areas, again, most of it is because of water. It's a water born issues, if you could boil the water, people have the education, to understand where it comes from and we've seen that in haiti and able to educate people about just the water and making sure your water is boiled. But, the cholera is nothing like it was two years ago. Two years ago it was a crisis. 

[00:44:51]


>> Greta: When you talk about boiling the the water in order to avoid getting cholera. Is the hatian government in any way trying to educate their people to boil the water so that they can avoid getting cholera or is that just left to the ngo's? 
>> Greta, I can't speak to that, I don't know what the government's doing, all I know is what we do. And we're just trying to fill a vacuum that is left by the government, by not being at the door when they need to be at the door. 
>> Greta: When I'm in haiti, what strikes me, there's one part of haiti that's absolutely chaos, I've been in cholera clinics, down the streets where it's just, you know, the thousands and thousands of people, there seems to be absolutely no order, squalor, poverty, people look hungry and then i go to some areas of haiti and it's the most magnificent beautiful place I've ever seen in my life. 
>> Well, the poverty isery real. I will say one thing that as an outsider and I'm speaking as an outsider myself even though I was living there three and a half years, living there for three years as an outsider. A lot of times what appeared to be chaos to us when we come into situations from the outside actually have their own sort of internal order. You'll see people out on the street and looks like they're just sort of you know, hawking things at random and shouting at cars passing by and it looks like total madness, but in fact, they're operating businesses there, part of long chains of command that go all the way back to the united states to producers and other places, and you know, they're in their own way, part of is global economy and have their own way of doing business and one of the problems a lot of outsiders have when they come into haiti and try to do good, and come in often times with very good intentionses mistake what they see around them for being nothingness or bleakness or chaos on which some kind of outside formal order has to be imposed without respecting the way that hatians conduct their lives on their own of course. And improving that understanding would be a significant and optimistic step improving the lives going forward. 

[00:46:55]


>> I think there's an awareness of cholera, but it could coming back by day and access to clean water is a tremendous issue in haiti. Lack of clean water causes so much health problems. High infant morality rate in haiti and that's one reason we worked with a lot of water and sanitation programs, digging new wells and teaching people sanitation techniques, how to wash their hands and take care of food to try to eliminate this. The good point of the terrible cholera epidemic, it did raise awareness, how you can fix it and work toward-- you're never going to fix cholera, but lessen the impact in the future. 
>> Greta: And the sadness how it got introduced this round into it country was post earthquake, when some u.N. People from the u.N., I guess, brought it in inadvertently. 
>> I think that's been documented. It came in and went in the water system literally down the street from where that u.N. Group was and spread rapidly. 
>> Any other health issues there. 
>> Infant morality is a huge issue, one of the highest rates in the country and goes to the lack of health care, good water sources and leads to the disease and infant morality. 
>> Greta: And when we were in haiti, former governor palin and I visited a clinic and doctors and nurses working to save the lives of hatian infants. 
>> We're at the clinic supported by samaritan's purse and of course many contributions from many around the world, but also by the many hard workers and we've talked to people, they're from denver, from all states around the country doing one thing, trying to help and here is the sign, you see cholera prevention treatment center, u.S. Aid from the american people and that's you all, the american people. And if you think your money doesn't make a difference, it sure does. Take a look at the pediatric unit, children all over come in here, would die within hours if they didn't get fluids. Governor palin is meeting a couple of the little children, but the children come in here literally hours away from death and with hard work, by all of these volunteers, from samaritan's purse and your u.S. Aid you're saving lives and this is a desperate situation. The cholera epidemic many people think has been grossly understated and a far graver problem in haiti than stated, but the bottom line, people here, if nothing else, are working really hard to save lives. 

[00:49:25]


>> Hey, little sweet love. 
>> And they came in I don't know if they told you about cholera, but we actually think the malnourishment is the bigger problem and these guys are sick and they look about, six week, six week old babe, so, their cholera, they beat quickly, but we're almost keeping them as long as we can so we can feed them as much as we can. 
>> Straight ahead. Education leads to jobs, what lessons are the children at the greta home and academy be taught to lead them to a successful life? A closer look inside the 
[ help balance? Try the #1 gastroenterologist recommended probiotic. Align. Align naturally helps maintain digestive balance. ?????? Ooh, baby, can I do for you today? ?????? try align today. Blp 

[00:53:22]


>> 80 hatian children not-- now given a chance at a new life. She gives us a closer look inside the new school. 
>> It's life changing for these children to have the opportunity to come to a school like this that has computers, that has a good quality teachers, and get a good education, most do not have that opportunity. That we believe that it will change their lives from this day forward. 
>> Stand up, please. Good morning, sir. 
>> Good morning. 
>> Say good good morning, teacher. 
>> Good morning, sir. 
>> Good morning, teacher. 
>> How are you? Nice to meet you. 
>> Nice to meet you. 
>> Okay, sit down. 
(Applause) 
>> some of the children that are living here at greta home and academy have lost their parents due to the earthquake. And many of them, their parents are poverty stricken, cannot cae for them so the hatian government classifies the children as needy or orphan that we house those type of children here at greta home. 
>> Mostly here in haiti, most children are-- do not have the ability to go to school. All of the school system here in haiti is private, so you have to pay a tuition fee. So many children don't have the opportunity to go to school and get a good education. Our education is going to focus on leadership, management, computers, linguistics and hope to offer some type of technical training for children, maybe in car carpentry and mechanics, and linguistic maybe as trancelators in the government. And we have 73 children we're caring for and our prayer would be really they have the opportunity that any child in america or another developed country would have and that is to attend school, meeting their needs educationally, physically, spiritually, to provide for them and give them better opportunity to succeed in life. I want their dreams to come true. I don't want them to not be able to fulfill their dreams due to lack of education, lack of skillset, lack of just being able to have a dream. We want to instill that future in each of them that they can accomplish whatever they set out to do.

>> The followingng program is brought to you by supple, the new, more powerful health regeneration drink by supple, llc. 
>> Hello, and welcome to the smart medicine show. I'm dr. Monita poudyal, and we have a great show today. If you have pain or know someone that has pain - joint pain, back pain, bone pain, muscle pain, or if you suffer from arthritis, osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, fibromyalgia or even weakness or fatigue, then you need to stay with us for the next half hour. We're going to be discussing medical breakthroughs that can help you eliminate pain, regain mobility and become stronger without dangerous drugs, surgery or negative side affects. My guest today is peter apatow. He's a leading arthritis advocate and is the founder of supple. Peter has created a revolutionary, all-natural drink, supple, that is now more powerful and more comprehensive than ever before. Supple is helping countless americans to live pain-free and mobile lives again. Peter apatow, thanks for being on the show. 
>> Thank you. It's awesome to be here. 
>> Now first, you're not a doctor, you're not a phd. What qualifies you as being an expert at getting rid of pain? 
>> Well, the world's greatest medical experts from the united nations, the bone and joint decade, they selected me and supple to be leading advocates, all around the world, to help end bone pain, joint pain, back pain and muscle pain. For everybody around the world. I'm not a doctor. What I am is a researcher and an arthritis survivor myself. 
>> What do you mean, arthritis survivor? >>Well, I suffered from severe arthritis pain in my left hip for decades. I was almost completely immobile, I could barely walk, i had pain day and night. It was painful to sit, to move, to stand. It was an absolute nightmare. I searched the entire world for a way to end my own nightmare of pain, and I did it. 

[00:02:10]


>> You found a way to end your own pain? 
>> Did. I discovered safe, all-natural building blocks that were being prescribed by doctors all over the world. They are healing agents that actually reverse the cartilage breakdown that causes joint pain. And you know what? Listen to this. Within just 7 days of taking these, it was unbelievable. I had a significant reduction in pain. 
>> Within 7 days? 
>> Within only 7 days. And I felt better week after week. Within a month or so, I was completely mobile again. I had no more pain, I was completely... I felt great. I could do things around the house, I could walk longer distances, I could sleep at night - now, I could ski, i could hike, I could play racquetball, I could jog, I could play tennis. I could do anything I want to do and no matter what I do, I can't even get the pain back. 
>> And now, you're completely pain-free, fully mobile again, just from drinking supple every day. 
>> Yeah. I'm fully mobile again. I'm completely pain-free and I have been now for years. But I'm not the only person that has these amazing results. Real supple users do too. In fact, if somebody's watching right now, they have to watch for the next half hour because I'm going to be sharing real inspirational stoes from real supple users. Now these people aren't actors, they're not paid, they're not reading off a script. These are real people telling their own stories in their own homes. Just listen to some of these amazing stories about how supple dramatically changed people's lives. 
>> It, it was a miracle to me. It was like taking, having absolutely somebody giving me a miracle drug. 
>> Now, there's no pain, at all. Supple has kind of just deleted the pain. 
>> After the first week, I could sleep. There was no pain. 
>> That's what sold me, was how great this supple tastes. 
>> Since taking supple, I don't have any pain. 
>> That's just incredible. Now, on our last show together, we talked about how the key ingredients in supple are the standard of care for the treatment of joint pain in europe. And really, the response has been amazing. From what I hear, you've been able to help millions of people. 

[00:04:19]


>> We're arthritis advocates and the active agents in supple, they've fast become the most used, best-selling joint rebuilding agents of all time. 13 million people are using these all over the world for safe, significant and complete relief, complete relief from all their joint problems. There's no question that supple works. 
>> And now you're seeing these kinds of results because there's a direct connection between the root causes of joint pain and the lack of core building blocks that your body needs to function properly. 
>> But it's not just joint pain. 
>> Ok. 
>> It's also bone pain and muscle pain, overall weakness and fatigue too. All these things are linked to a common nutritional deficiency that's affecting, possibly, 77 percent of our entire population. 
>> So is this why you changed the original supple formula? 
>> It is. By just adding nutritional building blocks identified in a new medical breakthrough, we can help significantly more people end bone pain, muscle pain, overall weakness and fatigue too, for the entire population, all these people that are suffering from this inadequately publicized nutritional deficiency. 
>> Now, does supple still taste good, despite this new, more powerful formula? 
>> Absolutely. Supple is delicious. I love the taste of supple. I drink it every day. It's fruity and sweet, has only 30 calories, no artificial sweeteners. It's completely all natural. Everybody loves the taste of supple. 
>> This stuff tastes delicious. 
>> Delicioso! 
>> It tastes so great you don't know that you're taking a mecation. 
>> It tastes like a really nice, thin, fruit smoothy. 
>> It tastes just wonderful. I love the taste of supple. 
>> It does sound tasty. Then why aren't the active ingredients in supple standard of care in the united states, the first thing that doctors reach for, just like they are in europe? 
>> Honestly? 
>> Yeah. 
>> Because the drug companies can't make billions of dollars a year selling these all-natural agents like they can their own pain drugs so they do everything they can to suppress them just to preserve their own profits. They manipulate the government, the government agencies, they manipulate the media, they fix scientific studies. 

[00:06:25]


>> But what's wrong with what's currently prescribed in the u.S.? 
>> Well the pain drugs, and I've tried them all. 
>> Yeah. 
>> Acetaminophen, nonsteroidal anti-inflamtory drugs, ibuprofen. All these things do nothing but just mask the pain. They don't treat the root causes of pain. 
>> Of course they come with lots of dangerous side affects if you use them too long, too. 
>> The pain always comes back and it always gets worse. And surgery is not much better. It comes with no guarantees and it can cause infections and blood clots and always requires significant rehabilitation. 
>> Very true. What do you think about all of those natural joint health supplements out there then? 
>> The problem is that there is very little or no legitimate clinical research showing that these things work at all or are even safe to use. To make matters worse, over 90 percent of the most popular agents that are sold in the united states have ingredients from china where the are significant problems with fake, counterfeit, low-quality and contaminated ingredients. 
>> So then how is supple any different? 
>> Well, supple doesn't just mask the pain, it heals the root causes of pain. It rebuilds your joints, it strengthens your bones and it makes you stronger. You don't have to worry about dangerous side affects. You can use it for as long as you need to. You could stop taking pain drugs, you could avoid surgery. We guarantee 100 percent of label claims. We use only the best ingredient sources, all from the united states. We use no key ingredients from china, and we guarantee the number one international doctor- recommended formula. And you know what? You could feel the difference. Just listen to this. 
>> And slowly, the arthritis had gotten so bad in my shoulder, my right elbow, my whole, my wrist, everywhere, and in every joint in my body just hurt so bad that I couldn't sleep between 2 to 4 hours a night for the last 4 to 5 years. So, we got the supple and i started drinking a can a day. I didn't say anything to my wife because, it had only been a week and I thought maybe its a coincidence. Well, a few more days went by and i, we were sitting having dinner and I told her, I said, you know, you haven't heard me complain here in a few days. And the fact is, I've had no pain in my shoulder, in my wrist, or my ankles in, truthfully, I believe it was 10 days is all it took. 

[00:08:35]


>> That's an amazing story. So let's talk about what patients with chronic joint pain have in common. 
>> Sure. 
>> Well first they have accelerated cartilage breakdown. Cartilage is that squishy stuff in the middle of the joint. Your body stops producing enough of the building blocks, the core building blocks, that they need to repair and replace old and damaged cartil so that cushion in your joints gets smaller and smaller and every time you try to move, it just hurts really bad. On top of that, your body sends in these enzymes that actually start eating away at your joints instead of repairing them. 
>> So your body's only defense system really makes the problem worse. 
>> Yeah. And then, you have swelling and inflammation and these abnormal bone growths. All these things cause incredible amounts of pain. The more pain you have, the less you use the joint. And then, your muscles, tendons and ligaments, all these things become weakened and overstrained. That causes more degeneration and even more pain. It's just a horrible, vicious, downward cycle. And people without any joint pain, they just can't possibly understand how bad it can be. 
>> And how does supple work? 
>> Well, supple just stops, it stops the vicious cycle of cartilage breakdown and degeneration. First it provides the core building blocks your body needs to heal and replace and repair the old and damaged cartilage. 
>> So it helps to restore an equilibrium of healthy cartilage? 
>> That's right. And then it stops, it removes the swelling and inflammation, it stops those enzymes that are eating away at your cartilage. It rebuilds your entire joint structures. It eliminates pain so you don't have to worry about pain in your bones, muscles and joints, and it helps you you to be more mobile again. Just listen to these real stories about how supple works. 
>> Working at the arthritis foundation, I've been able to turn a lot of people on to it, through our events. We hand out free samples of supple, and I've heard just very many stories like myself. People that have had their lives dramatically changed. People who's pain is much worse than mine. 
>> I've had rheumatoid arthritis for many many years, and doctors, all they ever did was just give me pain medicine. Nothing would get rid of the pain. I mean, it always came back. And I always had trouble sleeping and stuff because the pain was so bad. So after being on supple for probably less than a week, I started getting the results of wonderful. My pain is bearable, it's not as bad, the swelling has gone down in my fingers, my ankle doesn't hurt as bad, and I really truly want to thank you supple for whatever this drink is, it is a miracle drink. 

[00:11:04]


>> It's a great value proposition, right? You eliminate pain by addressing the root causes of the pain, you regain strength and mobility, it has almost no calories, certainly no significant negative side effects, and it tastes great. 
>> Absolutely. Supple is the fast, safe, all- natural, international doctor- recommended way for anyone to get significant relief and get rid of all their pain, all their immobility, all their suffering once and for all. If you just try a can of supple every day, you can feel a significant difference in just 7 days and better every week. It's absolutely delicious. I am so confident that supple will work for you, that I want to challenge everyone who's suffering from any kind of pain to call in, to try supple risk- free for 60 days - not 30 days 
- 60 days. And to drink every can to the absolute bottom. If you don't completely love the taste, if you don't feel better week-after-week, if supple does not completely transform your life, I'll give you your money back. 
>> You're guaranteeing the product? 
>> Absolutely. I'll give you your money back. This is a 100 percent unconditional, money-back guarantee. People need to try supple because it works. Just listen to what real users have to say. 
>> I was in pain. I know what that feels like. I'm not in pain any more. I noticed a difference after about a week. But, after three weeks, I felt great. 
>> Well, it kept me out of a nursing home and I'm still on the farm where I want to be. 
>> Since I began the supple program, I have never had, in this whole year, what I call and refer to as a flare-up. 
>> I use these cans of supple as ammunition against my pain. 
>> I noticed a marked improvement almost immediately, with a lot less pain and a lot more agility. It has been a life-changer and a true, true miracle. I cannot find any other words for it. 
>> But I really love supple. It really saved me. As much as I love my television, I'll shut my tv off before I'll give up drinking supple. That's how much faith I have in it. And anybody that doesn't try this is foolish because it really, really works. 

[00:13:13]


>> If you're watching right now, we talking with international arthritis advocate and arthritis survivor, peter apatow. Peter has been selected by the world's greatest medical experts in the united nations bone and joint decade to be a leading advocate, to help end pain all around the world. If you have joint pain, back pain, bone pain, muscle pain, or even weakness and fatigue, and you want to get more information on how to get the new, more powerful supple drink, pick up the phone and call the number on your screen. We've worked out a special introductory offer that's only available on the smart medicine show if you call today. I encourage you to try delicious supple absolutely risk-free 60 days. You've heard from real people who've experienced incredible results from supple and now you can, too. Pick up the phone and call right now. Now peter, pain drugs, steroids, pain creams, they're not joint regenerating agents, are they? 
>> No, they're not. Those are all just drugs that do nothing but mask the pain. The reason that you have the pain is still there. And when the pain is no longer bearable and these drugs stop working, doctors recommend surgery that could lead to even more pain and even more degeneration with no guarantees. 
>> Of course it makes sense to avooid taking drugs and doing surgery whenever possible. 
>> Yeah. And with supple, you could get rid of pain without dangerous drugs or surgery. Supple is the missing link that heals the root causes of pain by providing the core building blocks your body needs to heal itself. 
>> So they don't go after the pain first, they address the root cause of joint degeneration, reverse them, and as a function of that, relieve the pain. 
>> Absolutely. They heal and rebuild the joint. At's what supple does. It rebuilds your entire joint structure, it eliminates pain, suffering and immobility and it helps you to be more mobile again. This is why people try supple. Just listen to how people are switching to supple as the safe, all-natural alternative to dangerous drugs and surgery. 

[00:15:15]


>> I really urge everyone to try this thing. I've had 15 years of agony and I can honestly and truly tell you, I've reduced, I'm off the medication I had from the doctors, I just quit taking it. 
>> I feel a lot better. I feel good every day. It's helped my joints really a lot. 
>> I was going to the doctor with knee trouble because I was bone-on-bone. And he recommended cortisone shots and I went and had those, and they really didn't do anything for me. Then, I was watching a program one night about supple and i ordered it. It was the best thing out that I've ever done for myself because it helped my knees, the cartilage come back into my knees. It helped my arthritic hands. 
>> By drinking the supple, I have not had to have any knee replacement. I do not have any pain at all in my knee now. The pain is totally gone. 
>> I just felt bad about every day having to take pain medication. And with supple i don't have to do that. 
>> With these kinds of results, why aren't the active agents in supple the first thing that doctors prescribe in the u.S.? 
>> It's because the drug companies. They're supressing them to preserve their own profits. Medical doctors only prescribe what's being pushed by the drug companies. And it's just a real tragedy because the medical research behind these agents, it's irrefutable. 
>> Why are you so confident in the research? 
>> It's simple. The active agents in supple are the most highly recommended joint rebuilding agents by the greatest medical experts in all of europe. They're standard of care in over 40 countries and over 13 million people use them safely every day, with no negative side effects. Over 20,000 human clinical studies, observational studies, laboratory studies, meta- analysis, expert reviews. All these kinds of studies are available at the national institutes of health on these ingredients alone. 
>> That's very interesting. 60 minutes recently did a show on the difficult battle against counterfeit drugs from other countries. Now, is this a problem with supplements too? 

[00:17:23]


>> It's a problem. The national institutes of health recently uncovered that all glucosamine and chondroitin, it's not the same. As much as 90 percent of these ingredients come from china and there's significant problems with counterfeiting, contamination, low-quality ingredients, skimping on ingredients, and even using low and unproven dosages. This is an example of a troubled industry that needs to be completely reformed. Supple, on the other hand, has no ingredients from china, and we use only the most high quality, best ingredient sources available. We don't use any of these unethical and deceptive business practices. Just listen to these real supple users who have learned that there's nothing more powerful than what's in supple. 
>> I've had back pain on and off since I was probably in my mid 20's, and since I've been taking supple I haven't had to deal with a back injury. Some of the other supplements had like glucosamine and chondroitin. Some of the basic ones that are out there but, nothing really stood out. Nothing really stood out until I started taking supple. 
>> This is my bad hip. The left. The pain was unbearable. I couldn't sleep, I couldn't walk. I tried 1,500 milligrams of glucosamine and 1,200 milligrams of chondroitin. But, they didn't do anything for me. My life has changed since i started to take supple. I'm a different woman now. I like to put on make-up, I like to get dressed up. It really works. 
>> Peter, how can supple possibly be so effective when so many other products fail to help people? 
>> Supple is the missing link that heals the root causes of pain. It reverses the disease process, it rebuilds your joints and it gives your body the core building blocks it needs to heal itself. Pain, stiffness, immobility, overall weakness, fatigue, difficulty moving, difficulty sleeping at night, all these things, they just fade away. Supple's core ingredients have been studied for over 35 years and we use only the highest quality and most clinically- proven ingredient sources available. 

[00:19:30]


>> What are the active ingredients in supple? 
>> Supple has 1,200 milligrams of pharmaceutical strength, very special chrondroitin sulfate. The same stuff that's prescribed as an all-natural, safe drug throughout europe, and that was exclusively selected by the national institutes of health. We have 1,500 milligrams of very special shellfish-free, u.S.- made, glucosamine hydrochloride and a very powerful, anti- oxidant healing blend, with high levels of vitamin d, c, e, b vitamins, calcium and magnesium. 
>> So what can people expect if they try supple? 
>> If you just drink a can of supple every day, it's delicious, and you try to be just a little bit more active, you can feel a significant difference in just 7 days and better every week. It's absolutely delicious. It'll help you get rid of all your pain, all of your immobility, all of your suffering. You could stop taking dangerous pain drugs, you could avoid surgery, and now the new, more powerful supple formula can help all americans that are suffering from a common nutritional deficiency get rid of bone pain, muscle pain, overall weakness and fatigue, too. I am so confident that supple will work for you that I want everyone to try supple risk-free for 60 days so they can feel the benefits for themselves, just like real supple users have. 
>> Within two weeks I could tell the difference. Plus, it's got a lot of vitamins and everything, and it gave me energy and it kept me out of the doctor's office. I wouldn't know what to do without supple. It has really, really helped me. 
>> I've had arthritis for, since I was 18, so it makes a big difference. 
>> What you spend on doctors, the price of supple is worth every nickel, every nickel. 
>> I started to experience a lot of back pain for the first time in my life when i, when I hit about 40 and it just got worse and worse with the more and more yard work i would do. After just probably about a week or two of drinking the supple, I'd come in from the yard and I'd expect to start to feel pain and there wouldn't be any. And the longer I drank the supple, the longer I could actually stay out in the yard. And I have no pain now. I can garden 8 hours, 2 days in a row and, and i really don't have any pain.

>> Peter, tell me more about the pain that you had. >>Well, I suffered like you couldn't even imagine for 15 years. I had severe pain in my left hip that led to pain in my back, my neck, my knees and my feet. 
>> And what did you try that worked for you? 
>> No matter what I tried- drugs, dietary supplements- nothing really gave me my mobility back or gave me complete relief. The truth is that these things just don't work because they don't get to the root cause of the problem. 
>> So what happened when you finally started taking supple? 
>> It was miraculous. Within 7 days, I felt a significant reduction in pain. Within a month, I was completely pain-free, I was fully mobile again, and I've been like that now for years. No matter what I do, I can't even get the pain back. It's my passion now just to help other people get their lives back and to stay active just like these real supple users have. 
>> As I get older, it's just important to me that I can do alhe activities that I want to do and not be held back by pain or injury and supple is part of that program of injury prevention and looking younger, feeling younger and staying active. 

[00:23:38]


>> I became a volunteer for the arthritis foundation. We had a walk and supple was one of the sponsors at the walk. And I was given several cans, and it wasn't any more than probably 3 or 4 days and i began to notice an improvement. And I thought, this can't be the supple you know. And so, I kept drinking it, and it kept getting better and better. And then finally, it dawned on me, yes indeed, this was supple. And it, it was a miracle to me. It was like taking, having absolutely somebody giving me a miracle drug. I could get up in the morning, i could get up and I could actually walk right away, I could come down the steps and walk. I didn't have excruciating pain any more. I would recommend this to anybody. This is the best thing I have ever found. 
>> That's an amazing story. I mean really all the stories you've shared with us today have been really inspirational. 
>> I know. They're just incredible. 
>> Now peter, we're running out of time but do you have any last minute thoughts you want to share with our viewers? 
>> Yes. I suffered from severe arthritis pain for decades. But today, my life is completely different. I have no more pain, no more immobility, no more suffering, I can sleep better at night, I take no pain drugs, I've avoided surgery completely, I'm fully active again. No matter what I do, I can't even get the pain back, and it's all because of supple. If you just drink a can of supple every day, you'll feel a significant difference in just 7 days and better every week. I drink supple every day. I absolutely love the taste. It's delicious - everyone loves the taste of supple. I am so confident that supple will work for you that I want to challenge everyone to try it risk-free for 60 days, to drink every can to the absolute bottom. If you don't completely love the taste, if you don't feel better week, after week, after week. If supple does not give you your life back, I'll give u your money back. 
>> You'll give everyone their money back. 
>> I'll give your money back. That's how confident I am that supple will work for you. 
>> So you're guaranteeing the product. 

[00:25:39]


>> I'm talking about a 100 percent unconditional guarantee for no more pain, no more immobility and no more suffering completely getting your life back. 
>> That's exciting, isn't it? 
>> Absolutely. I want people to be able to experience the same incredible results that real supple users have for 60 days risk-free. If anybody tries supple and they're not completely satisfied, just call us, we'll give you're money back. 
>> I noticed a difference after about a week. But after three weeks, I felt great. Since taking supple, I don't have any pain. 
>> Now, there's no pain, at all. Supple has really kind of just deleted the pain. 
>> I'm working much harder, more hours a day, all in a month's period is just incredible to me, with no doctors' assistance. Strictly, right here, just out of this can, is just incredible. 
>> Arthritis doctor after arthritis doctor, and they've given me steroid shots, they've given me pain pills that didn't work. And your body doesn't need all that garbage. Plus, this stuff tastes good. I enjoy it. After the first week, I could sleep - there was no pain. 
>> I ran out of the product, and when I was off of it for a week or so, I was hurting very badly. And I went back on it and almost immediately I had relief. 
>> The problem is that I would always do every activity that i wanted to do, and I'd pay for it later. And now, I just don't pay for it later, as much. It's, it's made a world of difference. That's what sold me, was how eat this supple tastes. Supple is, it's amazing. 
>> Go aheadnd try it. You've got nothing to lose. If it does what it did to me, supple will be what you want. 
>> If you've ever had any kind of tendonitis or arthritis that's really a nagging, gnawing problem, you owe it to yourself to try this stuff. It's just an incredible thing. And I find it hard to believe it will work just for me only.

Every day that goes by your movements wear on joints and cartilage in your body so there must be a rebuilding process. As you grow older, you may stop making Bone Activating Proteins. When they are not present they don't activate the replenishing cells around the bones that form new bone and cartilage. The rebuilding process stops and the end result can be weaker bones as well as painful joints. When the Bone Activating Proteins are present they activate replenishing cells around the bones so that they can actually use the existing building blocks to form new bone and cartilage. The end result is when you replace the missing bone activating proteins you get long-term bone and joint health. And most importantly you get your life back. Our Bone & Joint Restore is clearly one of the most effective, clinically tested non-drug supplements on the market today... period. 
>> There are two university studies, one from Oxford that show as we get older many of us stop making these bone activating proteins and that is when our bone and joint problems begin. Now they have been studied for over 40 years with 20 years of clinical use but we're just bringing this medical breakthrough, new to the public, for the first time. >>Cindy: I would sleep with ice packs under my knees, my shoulders, on the top and the bottom. I had to get help out of bed in the morning, help to get in the bed at night. . . . And my kids, I couldn't pick up my kids, literally could not pick them up. And they were young they didn't understand why... momma couldn't pick them up. It was debilitating to me. My work is very physical and I could barely get to work, get through the day without having to take a lot of medication. I was 41 at the time and I was seriously walking with a cane. I cot step up off of a curb. It was uh it was bad, it was bad. I mean I have been physical my whole life, and I couldn't do anything. I tried it. And it's changed my life. I tell everybody I see, it has changed my life. I work out now. I run with my kids. I am able to swim and play with my kids. I work a 12 hour day every day. I was up to about 3200 milligrams of over the counter a day. And that was the max my Doctor would let me take. I'm completely free of that. I can step up stairs, no canes. I don't know where they are in their lives, but I know where I was, and I know the pain that I had. And I have changed my life. I can't believe it. This one little supplement has changed my life. And I can't believe everybody doesn't know about it. 

[00:05:47]


>> We saw Cindy a little while later and she showed us this receipt envelope. Take a look at this. $14,300, that's what she personally paid trying to get rid of her arthritis pain. And the insurance company paid on top of that. Can you imagine what that total was? And she still couldn't get rid of the pain until she started using the StimTein bone and joint restore. And now she lives of pain-free life, and so do these people. 
>> I didn't think there was anything that could do anything for my knees. I've tried a lot of different things, but I didn't think there was anything that could actually help or work. We live in an upstairs apartment and going up and down the stairs several times a day was really painful, and I struggled to make it up the stairs, especially if you were carrying groceries or anything like that. So one ah ha moment was wow I can run up and down the stairs and I'm not struggling to try and pull myself up or hold on to the railing to try and get down. And even, I was going to the gym and I had so much pain I was wearing knee braces on both of my knees just to walk the treadmill. So to go from that to being able to run up and down the stairs or do the elliptical machine that I couldn't do before, it's unbelievable. I mean I have no pain, from going to not being able to get up and down the stairs, pulling myself on the railing to no pain. 
>> The joint starts to decrease, that cartilage cushion between the joints and when that happens we irritate the surrounding tissue, we irritate the surrounding blood supply and in order to restore the normal cushioning to that joint you need the raw ingredients. So these proteins provide the raw ingredients and as the tissue itself becomes healthier the pain becomes less and less, the function becomes higher. >>Cheryl: When it got real bad, like we'd be standing, basically at the end of the day was when it was worst. At the end of the day, you know we worked an eight hour shift, and I could barely stand up sometimes, and I'd be shifting back and forth, um because I would have that pain, and a lot of times. . . um I have not gone to the doctor and have not gotten it diagnosed, but most likely it's a sciatic problem too, in the lower back, you know at the left part of my back, going in to my hip area. So I've had that too, so that's been a real improvement too. >>Akira: Around my pelvic bones, down through my thighs and knees, it was just horrible. I was in pain so much that especially when I walked, I couldn't walk very much. And I used to curse my doctor because he would not give me a temporary handicap parking permit. Every time I went from the car to the pharmacist or to the spa to try to do my swimming exercises I would have to stop half way, lean on somebody else's car and curse my doctor and then go on my way. I couldn't even rake the yard, I would start raking the lychee leaves, before I would finish the pain was so intense that I would just have to throw the rake down and go back in to the house and lie down. The pain first diminished from my abdominal and intestinal areas and then it gradually went away so that now when I am just resting or sleeping there is absolutely no pain at all. At least I can walk without having to stop. I can go to the spa now and even if I have to park far away from the spa areas I can still walk there. And I can go from the car to the pharmacy. I can go shopping. I can now squat and I can weed. I can rake the yard. I can do all the things that I wanted to do now. After nine months of suffering I feel like I am reborn again. It's just amazing. 

[00:09:23]


>> The first time I saw these proteins come across my desk, I said uh here is another supplement. And I did what I always do when these things come across my desk, and that is I look at the research. I went back and I looked at the research about proteins, did they stimulate bone growth, did they stimulate cartilage growth? The research was very good and I said all right this has potential. So then I started to research it a little bit more in the oral application in this particular product. Then I said it's worth a try. Then we brought into the office, a few patients here and there. Once I started to see the results, now it's one of my routine recommendations for people would joint painor who have bone health concerns. 
>> Coming up we have a segment on glucosamine and calcium that is going to completely shock you. We have a medical segment with a very different twist. And see how this x-ray with the bone going across a half inch gap was the clue that started the whole thing. 
>> If pain stemming from unhealthy joints or if bone density is stopping you from living life to its fullest then StimTein Bone and Joint Restore is what you've been looking for. The Bone Activating Proteins in StimTein are backed by 40 years of research. They've been in over 9107 studies from all over the world including the New York University Hospital for Joint Diseases, New New York, University of Oxford in England, Tokyo Medical University, Tokyo, Japan, University of Guelph, Ontario, Canada, Naval General Hospital, Beijing, China, Department of Orthopedic Surgery, UC San Diego, and the list goes on. Our Bone & Joint Restore is clearly one of the most effective, clinically tested non-drug supplements on the market today... period. Every day that goes by your movements wear on joints and cartilage in your body so there must be a rebuilding process. As you grow older, you may stop making Bone Activating Proteins. When they are not present they don't activate the replenishing cells around the bones that form new bone and cartilage. The rebuilding process stops and the end result can be weaker bones as well as painful joints. When the Bone Activating Proteins are present they activate replenishing cells around the bones so that they can actually use the existing building blocks to form new bone and cartilage. The end result is when you replace the missing bone activating proteins you get long-term bone in joint health. And most importantly you get your life back. StimTein's Bone & Joint Restore with bone activating proteins comes with a 60 day full satisfaction, money back guarantee. >>Kim: At first I thought it was a gimmick and then I'm thinking well, I found myself not taking as many pain relievers. And the weeks went by taking it, the less I started taking them and I don't take them at all anymore. >>Dr. Steven Lund: The problem is you have to do something rebuilds it or otherwise you're on a train it's not getting you where you want to go. You're on a train it's going to end up getting you more and more pain medication, more and more anti-inflammatory's. And with this product it helps rebuild it. It also sets the groundwork so that now your calcium and phosphorus, and other things you are taking will have something to land in. It's going to stimulate these cells to work properly, that they will build bone, so that they will build joints, they will build cartilage that you need to rebuild to stop the negative impact like I did when you were young. 

[00:12:57]


>> It was my own background in science and health care, I also did research at Massachusetts General and Boston Biomedical Research Institute so I needed to see statistics. I needed to see if it actually worked and it wasn't just anecdotal, and someone was just telling me. So the product has actually been around for 40 years of research, it's been around 22 years of clinical use and so I had an opportunity to review a large numr of studies and publications describing how these proteins were used and what their effectiveness was. And this is the first time I've seen something that was scientifically valid and also I saw the clinical results as well personally. 
>> When you can do the simple things in life you've stopped doing like take a walk, feel the joy of your favorite recreation or just pick up your grand kids or hug your spouse. That is priceless.

>> Taking calcium for your bones is a good idea but it's not the answer. And we know it's not the answer, because look at all the calcium fortified foods we have today. Calcium fortified milk, calcium fortified yogurt, calcium fortified orange juice. I mean calcium's ftified through out the foods we consume today. Yet osteoporosis, osteopenia, weakening of the bones is at an all-time high. So clearly just taking calcium isn't the answer. The missing link is these proteins, because these proteins build the bone mass so the calcium has something to bind to and it actually helps you absorb the calcium better. So calcium's good but as we can tell, it's not the answer. The proteins are the answer. 

[00:15:16]


>> In keeping with what the doctors said about the calcium, this is the picture that started the whole thing. These are actual X-rays of bone growing across a half inch gap in a person's leg. And guess what, calcium had nothing to do with this. It was the proteins that produced the results and it was a verification that they could do the same with cartilage in joints. Now of course this was surgically done but we wanted to see if the oral version of these natural proteins would produce an effect. So that's why we performed clinical test and what you're seeing on this program are the amazing results. And it's something that could happen for you. 
>> I have a personal clinical case that I would like to discuss with you first though. We had a young lady, 51 years old who had injured herself. And with the MRI they found Avascular Necrosis which is hip and severe degenerative joint disease, or arthritis in both joints. We started the supplementation with the natural proteins. 11 months later we followed up with her with a second MRI. The report back from the radiologist was that there was only arthritis in one hip, not both. And it was very mild. And what the MRI showed us was that the Avascular Necrosis was gone. 
>> Osteoporosis is thinning of the bones and osteopenia, huge huge problem today. It is so nice to be able to give my patients an option where they can stimulate their body to grow more bone. When you grow more bone then the calcium, magnesium and all the other things you take have something to bind to. And I've seen these proteins improve people's bone density results, they're "Dexas" they are called, extremely well. One patient went from osteopenia to normal lumbar spine, bone density, in 14 months. 14 months, that's unheard of. >>Meganne: I barely could walk. I had, couldn't lift my head, couldn't use my hands, couldn't lift stuff, ride my bike. The things I like to do. So that's when I found your product and decided to use it. I ride my bike everyday. I am very happy that I am able to do things on my own now without having medication. I noticed that I can start to use my hands better, because I love to garden. I love organic vegetables so I've got a whole garden. I couldn't do that before, so I am able to perform tasks that I never was able to do in years. 

[00:17:45]


>> It would hurt. I used canes to keep my self steady because I didn't want to fall. I've used Walker's. I've been in wheelchairs. So I've been taking this product, and every since I've been taking it I didn't feel any pain in my hands, in my feet, in my knees. I was like, oh my gosh, I got out of bed and I didn't feel any pain. So that's when the light bulb went off saying this product is really working. And actually, I've joined a yoga class. I never thought I would be able to do yoga. People actually complimented me in my class, coming up to me say how I have improved in how I am stretching. 
>> Many doctors give StimTein to their patients but what so different about this next segment is that the doctors and medical personnel take the StimTein bone in joint restore themselves. 
>> We are inundated with products to try, the latest greatest thing and it just gets frustrating for us to hear all the hype and not see the results until I tried Stimtein. And I was very impressed. I've noticed that I have had a change in the joint pain that I was experiencing. I was having transitory joint pain, which means that it moved around. Sometimes it was in my knuckles, sometimes it was in my knees, sometimes it's in my feet. So it's moving around, and I've noticed a big change. Actually, I am not having pain now. 
>> I have a very mild arthritic joint in my thumb and it would pain me and become swollen occasionally. Since I've used these proteins I have found that there is very little swelling, there is no pain and discomfort and no loss strength whatsoever. 
>> I know what this does, I know the science behind it. I thought it can't do anything but help me. So I started on it, and I definitely noticed a change how my neck moves. The level of discomfort I would have in the morning was dramatically improved. I had much less discomfort. And over time it got better and better, now I can do all kinds of things I couldn't do before. I swim a mile at a time that would kill my neck in the past. I ski, I do all sorts of activities. I bike ride, I bike ride one or two times of day. It doesn't bother me like it did. In fact doesn't really bother me. So my neck is doing better than it has in decades. 

[00:20:03]


>> My shoulder, I know there is a definite improvement, I mean that's absolutely undeniably, I can tell the fact that there's a major change and I have not done any more. I am still; I am amazed I can move it as much as I can move it. I mean like right now I can move it, and I am not feeling any, where I would have had a lot of sharp pain. 
>> The main problem is my knees, and pain and burning. And the burning is the real issue because you feel that all the time. And the first thing I noticed was that the burn was gone. It was really gone. And I was very surprised and I was like, OK can it be this product? And the more I thought about it I wasn't doing anything else, I wasn't taking any over the counter medications, I wasn't doing anything different, and all of a sudden that burn was gone. And I was a lot more comfortable. . . 
>> Beverly had wanted to ride a bicycle for 15 years but she couldn't because her knees hurt so bad. She just recently sent this to us. If a picture is worth a thousand words this one has to be worth a million. Just look at that smile. She got her life back, she can do the things she wanted to do for so long and so can you. 
>> It hurt, there were times, if I lifted to get something out of the cupboard I would go to my knees and have to crawl to the table or to the chair, and just sit there until that pain went away. And now I noticed that every time I go to lift up to get something out of the cupboard I don't have that pain anymore. I can literally stand on my tippy toes and it doesn't bother me. It works. It has worked for me. It's made my life different. You know I can walk more, longer. I feel better. I can get up in the morning and I'm not stiff. 
>> Before I started this it was a major ordeal to get in and out of the car; limited motion, it was always painful to walk, that type of thing. I mean that's my biggest complaint. Now what I'm feeling is there are so many positives that I don't have that stabbing sharp pain like I had all the time. Like today, jumped in and out of the thing and its like okay no big deal. I noticed things that I could start to do more like crossing my legs. Two days ago I'm sitting there thinking I wonder if I can cross my leg, which is something that I could never do up to that point. And I could cross my leg like a normal person and even put on a sock without having to scream in pain. 

[00:22:24]


>> For many s prior to these proteins I did recommend glucosamine and chondroitin. I took it myself with again, very limited success. As a matter of fact there were two articles, both published in the New England Journal of Medicine looking at glucosamine and chondroitin and some long-term studies with people with osteoarthritis and they found it to be of little benefit. 
>> Glucosamine, vitamin C, all the things, those aren't going to regrow the bone. Are going to help, no question about it that those things can help. But what's missing is the ground substance, the matrix, the bone matrix. And where that comes from is these bone activating proteins, 18,000 plus investigators have looked at this. 9100 plus studies have shown that these activate bone growth. Right? That's the difference. Why is this different? Well, that's why it's different. Because it's bone growth, cartilage growth, we have to get those things growing again. 
>> Usually right before the rain, you know its big rainy day or its cloudy outside, my knee, at night I can't sleep. And I have to put on a tight brace thing around my leg so I can get some sleep. And I haven't used that. I'm a waitress. I am on my feet. That's another thing. I'm on my feet all the time. I need my legs. I was taking over the counter medicine that had tons of side effects. Sometimes three times a day just to get the bite of the pain off. I don't have that bite. And now I'm not taking it at all. I am not having that pain at night so I'm able to sleep. This is for real. This is real. I haven't used my leg thing at night. 
>> I was going to the gym, and had been working out, riding the bicycle, and I realized whenever I was riding I had pain in my knee. And then I started taking the Stimtein and actually started, I was still doing my regular routine of biking and it didn't hurt anymore. It was amazing. So I was riding the bike and not taking Stimtein, like I had forgotten to take it and I would have to end my twenty minute cycle of bicycle riding. I mean I could only go for like ten to fifteen minutes before there was too much pain to do it. And then when I went back on it, I was remembering to take the Stimtein regularly I didn't have any pain. I thought wow. I realized when I got off of the bike there wasn't any pain. The relief it gave me was incredible. >>Kathryn: Before, he couldn't get in and out of a car. He would actually have to physically pick his leg up and put it in the car. He couldn't get in and out. He would have to pull himself in and pull himself out from the car. Now, no problem. He get's in and out, its great. It's the old Drew from twenty years ago.

>> StimTein's Bone & Joint Restore with bone activating proteins comes with a 60 day full satisfaction, money back guarantee. Our bone and joint restore is clearly one of the most effective, clinically tested non-drug supplements on the market today... period. 
>> Everyone else I know is going through knee surgery and having knee replacements, so there's got to be other options, which thank God this was the other option. Ya know. And it works. 
>> The difference is, is that these bone stimulating proteins, bone activating proteins aren't there as you get older. They reduce genetically, they get less as you grow, as you age. Right? So we have to supplement them. 
>> When you can do the simple things in life you've stopped doing like take a walk, feel the joy of your favorite recreation or just pick up your grand kids or hug your spouse. That is priceless. Why mask symptoms when long-term bone and joint health can let you live again? Have your credit card ready and call the number on your screen right now.

>> These proteins are about long-term bone and joint health. The proteins will stimulate your body's ability to make bone matrix, makes your bones stronger. The proteins will stimulate your body's ability to make cartilage which makes your joints healthier. Strong bones, healthy joints, you can do more things. Functional indexes improve which means you're more active. And activity is life. 

[00:27:04]


>> I noticed it yesterday when I was playing golf I had absolutely no pain in swinging or stepping on and off the golf cart or walking. 
>> But I'm not wearing that knee brace and I am sleeping at night. That's. . I'm sleeping at night. 
>> You just got to try it. I was so desperate after nine months of pain and frustration. I looked at the testimonial on the Internet and I thought well what the hell you know what have I got to lose? It's my life I'm talking about. So I tried it and I'm really glad I did. 
>> There's no magic pill. Well guess what, there is. 
>> If I take this I don't have any pain. So its like that means no drugs in my body and I'm taking all the right things to make it feel better and do much better. 
>> This one actually did do what it's supposed to do. 
>> There's so many things out there you don't know what's going to work and what's not going to work. This fortunately did work. 
>> My shoulder I know there's a definite improvement, that's absolutely undeniably I can tell the fact that there is a major change. 
>> This helped me tremendously. I can't tell you how much, I'm shocked. I actually am shocked. 
>> The burn was gone. It was really gone, and I was very surprised. 
>> I've changed my life. I can't believe it, this one little supplement has changed my life and I can't believe that everybody doesn't know about it. They will. They've got to try this, I'm telling you you've got to try it. It's amazing.

If you have an idea for the president, join us in the conversation online on obamamemo on twitter or cnn.Com/fareed. You can see our regular show on sundays at 10:00 a.M. And 1:00 p.M. Eastern. Thank you for watching. 
>>> This is "piers morgan tonight" and the doctor is in. Extraordinary hour with dr. Oz. 
>> When I look around this country and I see people with big bellies I see folks who can't cope with stress. 
>> Taking your questions and taking on the health issues that really matter. 
>> The number one underappreciated health problem in america is sleep issues. 
>> The crisis facing america. 
>> French fries by themselves the single worse food in the u.S. Diet. 
>> Dangerous new flu bug. 
>> Might be the worst in ten years. 
>> Also, stress, sleep, sex and secrets for long and healthy life. No exercise. I've drunk far too much alcohol, eaten far too much bad food and I feel great. Plus moment of truth. The results of my own 15-minute dr. Oz physical. 
>> Not yet. 
>> Am I about to die? 
>> Her's the reason as a friend that I want to highlight this last number for you. High blood pressure? 
>> It's high. 
>> How high? 
>> This is "piers morgan tonight." 
>>> Welcome to our special episode. Dr. Mehmet oz is here and studio audience. Let's get right to it. How are you? 
>> Very, very well. 
>> Happy new year to. 
>> Same to you, my friend. 
>> Like everybody in america and this audience and the world, we get to january and we think, wow. I've got to sort myself out. I do anyway. You clearly don't. You're super fit. When's the best an advice for people who get to january, new year, new me, new start? 

[00:02:01]


>> Well, resolutions actually do make a difference. It turns out this ritual of the time of rome is still around because when you focus on what to do and you have a concrete plan and you go public on it, tell people in your life you're doing it, they'll hold you accountable. What are the stories you're telling yourself and the problem in america but all over the world same story is our brains are racing. We are beating ourselves up we did gain a few pounds over the holidays, unhappy. Trying to feed that emotion and that causes a lot of headaches, obesity top of mind on this example. 
>> Seven out of ten americans according to u.S. Government are overweight. 
>> Yeah. 
>> That's pretty frightening. 
>> It's frightening for a lot of reasons. As a ravages. I see what's going on with that precious organ in our heart. Like a python curling in there and clogged with cholesterol and forced to work hard against high blood pressure and caused by the overweight belly that is so many of us are carrying around it causes big issues and has a huge medical impact on us and ravages the health care system. 
>> What are the particular issues that face americans and their health? What are the things about the american diet, the way of life, whatever it may be, that are particular perhaps to america? 
>> We have made it easy to do the wrong thing in america. We subsidize foods that are not good for us. I don't mind a bun here and there but it incorporates empty calories. Our brain's really smart and looking for nutrients, not calories. If you eat a soft drink, french fries, single worst food in the u.S. Diet, probably gaining three pounds a year just that alone. 
>> French fries. 
>> Real good old-fashioned potatoes, that's fine. But when you add sugar or salt to these things and fry them down, our bodies can't deal with that. Wait a minute, tiger. You didn't give me nutrients. 
>> Coming to america seven years ago, I was struck coming from europe two things. One, the incredible amount of fast food that you americans guzzle. And secondly, the amazing portions that come with almost every meal. You cannot order breakfast in america without somebody in a restaurant shoveling on potatoes or fries without asking for it. You shovel out the food. 

[00:04:21]


>> A reality and beginning to -- 
>> I mean that in a nice way by the way. 
>> Polite. We have gotten comfortable making the portions part of what we do. You move the plate size to one large which is what we have done and now we have 11-inch plates. That's a lot more food than a 9-inch plate or 7-inch plate and visually making food look like it's supposed to be that size. 
>> If everybody just exercised better portion control, literally cut the amount they ate by, say, a third, what effect would that have on the average life? 
>> Change our life pectancy and the quality of the life and also dra malt cli change the u.S. Health care budget which is the big issue for a lot of folks paying attention to the current crisis in washington. There is no way, I don't care what side of the aisle you're on, no way to balance health care budgets in this country without making us less heay. The side effects of the extra weight. This is a national security crisis we're talking about and it's not a battle to win in hospitals. As much as I wish I could heal with steel, the blade and your sternum connecting, the reality is winning the bat 8 for health in the living rooms and bedrooms and kitchens. That's hard for washington to legislate. That's something we have to change in our own lives making it easier to do the right thing. 
>> You've been hanging out with the washington all-stars. Take a look at you and the first lady here. 
>> One of the things that we tried to do is be a source of information and education and one of the reasons why I started with kids and I'm focused on childhood obesity but I know that people will do for their kids what they're not willing or able to do for themselves. 
>> Is it good for america to have a first lady and president who are obviously very physically fit themselves? 
>> Huge benefit for the country. I think they serve as a role model. That was a soulful interview. The first lady spoke very honestly about the fact that she feels and I think we can all agree on this, we are mortgaging the future of our nation on the back of the health care challenge that is our kids are going to face and for the first time this year seeing a significant reduction in life expectancy, especially among people that never graduated from high school. Not only income splits divide the nation, now life expectancy splits, as well. 

[00:06:42]


>> How much is worsened by a lack of basic moiblt, moving to a world, really, of computer games, television and all the rest of it, you know, I was struck by my vacation last week with my three teenage sons how it compared to ten year ago when they were younger. They were outside the whole time. This time, you could barely get them off the computers. Very different. No as healthy. 
>> It's nice outside, the kids ought to be outside. And that's -- 
>> you try to get them out. 
>> It is hard. You have to connect the television set and full key boards. That stated, that stated physical activity for kids is a hugely important reality but that's not how you lose weight by itself. Yes, we are struggling communities now because we don't have sidewalks. We have made it hard for kids to get fifth. How many of you walked to school when you were kids? Pretty much all the adults except the kids in the back. Data is 60% of my generation, roughly the same age, walked to school. Today, it's less than 10%. 
>> If you walked as an adult for half an hour a day, you know, i walk here across central park, say, to cnn, I feel like it's a pretty good exercise walking at a reasonable pace. Is that enough to be fit? 
>> Perfect amount. The goal -- 
>> I'm basically a perfect specimen then? 
>> I have your lab studies here. >>Dy this. 
>> Don't look at them yet. We'll get to these. 
>> It's enough. After a two-week break, not going to be good. British beer. Also turkey. And lots of rum. Wine. It's going to be ghastly. We'll come to that later. 
>> We'll tease that reality. I have seen the tests and talking about them because you're mr. America in many ways. Despite your british okay krentd. You know, physical activity, looking around the world, places where people live a long time, it is not about going to the gym every day and an arduous two-hour workout once in a while but about 30 minutes of activity that brings your heart rate up a little bit. So walking to work is about the best and smartest thing to do. Also, you don't have to do a workout at the end of the day. You have your activity. People who have jobs, walk the steps there or get up and go to somewhere else to have lunch. People at home with the kids, go to the mall, walk fourther from the mall. 

[00:08:57]


>> A lot of this is obviously about having personal discipline. I want to play of an interview of chris christie and may well be a future president of the united states and well documented problem with his weight. 
>> The thing that I feel most guilty about, my weight. 
>> Really? 
>> Yeah. Yeah. Because I'm really struggling. Been struggling for a long time with it. And I know that it would be better for my kids if I got it more under control. And so I feel a sense of guilt at times about that. 
>> Why do you think you've had a battle with your weight? 
>> If I could figure it ourt, I'd fix it. 
>> You don't know what it is? 
>> I don't. 
>> Do you ever get help for it? 
>> Sure. Plenty of times. 
>> Where do you fall down in terms of dealing with it? 
>> I eat too much. I mean, it's not a complicated thing. 
>> I mean, I love chris christie and the honesty there and he's got an amazing energy for a guy, you know, who people say is too overweight to be president. It's worked through the storms recently, showed that he's a man of natural energy. 
>> It lives with his family, his wife is wonderful and worked with him on this. The reality is there are opportunities to lead and they come in unique ways. By being overweight, the governor has a chance of losing that weight and I think a fantastic role model for the nation. Governor huckabee did this a few years ago and changed people and here's a man who's obviously competent. Darn good at it. He's got a lot of wisdom, spokes glowingly and beautifully about thing that is affect us with the emotional undertones but asking him that key question and you are so good at asking the questions, why do you think it? He doesn't know. That I think in a sentence encapsulates the challenge in america. We don't know why we're gaining weight. To lay it out for two second here. There's a dozen redundant biological systems that force us to overeat. Never, piers, in the history as a species a time to lose weight. Now we have a crisis because the same realities that causes us to overeat a century ago, a thousand years ago much more prevalent now and that's stress. Think about it. A stress event a thousand years ago wasn't a deadline, a paycheck. It might have been marital stress but probably that anyone. Not having enough food and caused chronic stress. Today it comes in the form of keyboards, devices that never turn out. Constant access to information. When I look around this country and see people with big bels, I see folks that can't cope with stress. That's an undertone of loss of health in america. 

[00:11:40]


>> The other big problem is a flu epidemic. Tends to be an annual thing but pretty virulent right now. What is the best thing people should do? Should they have the jab? 
>> I think without question. It's not too late. This season looks like the worst in ten years, still see. It's certainly one of the earliest rises of cases that we have seen in a long time. The flu shot seems to be pretty good match for the virus we are seeing around town. I must say my own family, we had a lot of flu going around. I got the shot. I'm obliged to. I did okay. Some folks get shot and still get the flu. It's a straightforward decision. 
>> I have never had a flu jab but I'll let you give me one on television tonight. 
>> Where can I give it to you? 
>> I'd rather in the arm, doctor, if that's all right with you. I think I know where you're heading with that. That's something to enjoy me being jabbed by dr. Oz. I want to talk to you something serious, an emotional visit to you made to the sandy hook school and a trauma like that on adults and children, everyone. Relates to the stress you just talked about. cold, nyquil, but I'm still stubbed up.

[00:15:53]


>>> Back with dr. Oz, our guest. Dr. Oz, you recently went up to sandy hook just before christmas. Very emotional trip I know for you. You raise a number of issues a I've debated the stuff about guns and so on since. Also there's a huge issue there about stress and trauma that comes out of these kind of incidents. The world's media tends to move on after a week or so. People left there have to try to rebuild their lives. You've seen lots of this. What's the best advice if there is any for people who get caught up in the terrible tragedies about how to somehow get back? 
>> We all I think crave is hope. It comes in many different forms. We all have difficult times in our lives. This is a particularly tragic event. I was up there that evening and it was so soulful to see the wonderful human beings traumatized. They knew the kids sitting in a church singing. Like angels. You could hear the whispers and the desire to help each other. They're there for each other and looking for hope. Hope's not about giving good news. I'm a heart surgeon. I don't always give good news. Sometimes it's bad news I have to give you. That's not what hope's about, though. Hope is about giving people an explanation, understanding of why it happened. Just making sense of things progresses the story quite a bit so I think the folks in newtown all over the nation and the world witness this trying to make sense of this. We'll never understand the senseless act but at least the aspiration we have to support each other rebuilds an understanding of what's important in our lives and that's something that I think many of us struggle with as we try to put perspective. We just past the holidays. For some people, the holidays is a sad time. For others exuberant. It is about happiness and happiness about being grateful an unpredictable, bad things sometimes happen. Taking time to figure out how to process that and moving on happens and what we are good at is a species. 
>> In terms of everybody else who watches these things and gets affected, too, lots of things in life have a traumatic affect on people, either observing a terrible event or involved in one, whatever. How do you deal with that particular kind of stress? Really like a death in the family, a death of a close friend, even for some people a death of a beloved pet? 

[00:18:05]


>> I can't tell you how many times we've lost one couple long-married couple and soon after lose the spouse, literally we have had to operate on the husband and the wife same night. 
>> Literally like a broken heart? Does it exist in medical terms, a broken heart? 
>> There is no question at all that broken hearts exist and theyill people. It's actually been looked at. The ability of the heart to pump changes, the ability to squeeze at the right rhythm. Stress is -- especially major stress but stress comes from so many unpredictable places. You lose a loved one and divorce, too. Out of the ten major stressors, six are financial. And they include things like divorce so you have -- it's not whether you face stress in life but whether you're going to be able to weather it the right way and that's a big takeaway message when every event like the senseless killing of so many children in newtown is reiterated in the mind and part of the psyche. 
>> When you try to deal with stress, how important is physical exercise to that process? Because whenever I've been through a tough time, I've always found that forcing myself to the gym, sweating it out, you always just feel a little bit better afterwards. 
>> There's no question the anecdote to stress. Probably what the species always used because we could go outside, begin to rev the engine, discharges a lot of hormones sort of pent up and either they serve as rage but they can decant and done with if you exercise. Doesn't take a lot. Literally stretching out even for five, ten minutes do it for you, but the other tip to share for stress is something that's used in many parts of the world, difficult environmental issues, and that's something called rotiola. Have you ever heard of that? It's siberia gingseng you take the root of the plant and available on the web readily and take the root an put it in vodka. 
>> Now we're talking. 
>> That's the old myth. Put the vodka -- 
>> this is my kind of medicine. This is why I like you, dr. Oz. Always a moment I think, great. 
>> You put that in the freezer and when your friends come over, you have a gently pinkened vodka which is to die for and actually it is an adaptogen. It helps cells adjust to stress. 

[00:20:18]


>> Love this. 
>> Very natural tool and emotional ones, as well. 
>> Good before a live show? 
>> Fantastic. I just had some. 
>> Are you basically telling me you've half cut on vodka your entire career? I wish I could. I wish it was available. There's a survival benefit of a shot of alcohol a day. It can come in any form you want. 
>> Last time I interviewed you told me really the secret to longevity is more sex and more red wine. 
>> In that order. Good news. 
>> I was thrilled. Can we have add a few cannabis joints for the equation now they're legal? 
>> Cannabis, fascinating story. There's no question there's medicinal benefit. For people who have some ailments that we don't have good solutions, fabulously useful. 
>> I know somebody with multiple sclerosis and it's an enormous release. Pain relief. 
>> Good for chemothera treatments. Appetite back and chemically why they work, the munchies happen because it turns on the hormones, those chemical receptors in the brain. All that said, the overtone of a nation which is trained for good reason to be suspect of addictive substances has hurt it and hindered it from being used. 
>> How addictive is it? 
>> As cigarettes in my opinion. 
>> Is it more dangerous than cigarettes? 
>> It has more dangers in part because when you're under the influence of cannabis, the judgment is a bit more affected than it would be under cigarettes. But net-net hard to prove it's more dangerous than cigarettes. With regard to things like lung cancer rates and the like and it's unregulated substances. 
>> If you as one of america's topmost renowned doctors says it's not more dangerous than cigarettes, surely it should be legalized like cigarettes. 
>> Tlar couple of problems with cannabis. The first is alters how you feel about life and I'm very suspect of any substance that does that because you should haven't to alter how you feel about life to enjoy it. It's a gateway tool for some who are susceptible to addictions to move on to other products. Secondly, it's completely unregulated in most states. Kids get these things, they try them. They don't know the impact or the substance is and causes an issue and I really do believe to legalize it but only for medicinal use and then ratchet down the illegal use of it. California freed up cannabis use does disservice to new jersey where I happen to live because new jersey it's legal to use cannabis for medicinal uses but illegal to buy it. How can you have that scenario? That's auggling act in america right now. I do predict to evolve to the profession with medical decisions like the use of cannabis appropriately for people with terminal cancer, for example, is freed up and don't let little kids should not be tested with the material hindered just like we don't want them to take cigarettes.

>>> I did not call 911 and i should have and I've come to find out that 50% of women while having heart attacks and suspecting they're having heart attacks do not call 911 and it was the stupidest decision i ever made in my life. 
>> Rosie o'donnell talking about the heart attack and the mistake that could have proved fatal. I'm back with the doctor now. I took this test before this show. I don't know why I allowed myself to do this. You had your team all over me like a bunch of gnats poking and prodding and pricking my fingers for blood. Taking blood pressures. What are the results? How bad a shape am I after -- i have to say this again, two-week vacation including a week in britain. You know how much we drink over there. 
>> As a preamble before I give you your results, let me comfort you by sharing with everybody that we have been going around the country doing these 15-minute physicals which despite the complaining is all the time it took to do and 15-minute physical concept out of a reality that so many folks fearful of the numbers and good news is all the numbers true for thousands of people we have taken care of across the country can change for the better. I'm not diagnosing cancer, ir irreparable issues. If everyone is listening to me and hear my voice right now, if you don't know your blood pressure, assume it's high. If you don't know the blood sugar, assume you have diabetes. These are noble numbers. Think ire inexpensive. These are free in the events and simple enough to carry. 
>> Get on with it. 
>> Okay. 
>> I want to hear it. 
>> Number one ager of all I will save for last is blood pressure. Body mass index, 28. Supposed to be around 25, less than 30 at the worst. So I'll give you that. The waist size -- 
>> how bad is that, the mass index? 
>> It's overweight category but I'm not that worried about that but the waist size. Because you want your waist size and everyone can do it right now, less than one half your height. You're 6'1"? 
>> Yeah. 6'1" and -- 

[00:29:15]


>> what should my waist be? 
>> Half of 73 inches which is 36 1/2 inches. 
>> It's not that. 
>> No, it's not. It's 39 inches. 
>> Wow! 39 inches. 
>> A shocker. 
>> Piers knows this. Most guys never buy a new belt after the age of 40. 
>> Correct. 
>> Right? They go like this. They put the waist down like this and they wonder around like this all day long, right? I have a 32-inch waist but you have problems going. That's the unfortunate reality where we live in this country. What's that cause? When you have belly fat, it does three things. The first thing it does is irritates the liver and when your liver is irritated it makes the wrong kind of cholesterol. Irritated kind of cholesterol of lousy ldl cholesterol. Your number is 145. 
>> How bad is that? 
>> Ideally less than 140. You're not too far off. Your liver is partly able to keep up. But the part about -- 
>> I'm punishing it to be fair. 
>> You are but the reason I can tell you are punishing is this is the part that concerns me is your healthy cholesterol, it's like mighty mouse. Healthy cholesterol is in there and powerful and strong and grabs the cholesterol and carries it away and that healthy cholesterol number supposed to be more than 45 to 50. 
>> What is mine? 37. 
>> Wow. That's not good. 
>> Not good. 
>> How do I get more healthy cholesterol? 
>> The best way to do it is to get the waist size down to 36 1/2 inches. 
>> What's the best way to do that? 
>> Tlar couple of little tips. Can I save that for a second? That's a significant discussion. That's the big takeaway from this exam. Next thing is blood sugar. It's fine. Less than 100. Yours is 86. High five. 
>> Round of applause. Come on. 
>> Despite all that. 
>> Got to take it. A glimmer of hope. 
>> Sweating. He's -- just barely gripping to the crevice of life about to fall in to the abyss, the darkness. Here's the reason as a friend that I want to highlight the last number for you, blood pressure. 
>> It is high? 
>> It is high. 

[00:31:15]


>> How high? 
>> It's supposedly to be ideally 115 over 75. Yours is 147 over 89. 
>> Wow! That is high. 
>> Yeah. That's high. 
>> Is that because I'm under the threat of being deported from america do you think? 
>> Could be. Could be that. It could be the knowledge of the test results on air but your blood pressure should never be that high. Unless you're in dire -- you know, amidst of sexual activity or exercis it is caused, again, because the belly fat that we have squeezes the kidneys. 
>> Can you call it something else? Make it sound a bit measure -- 
>> the pooch you have -- 
>> no. Stick to belly fat. 
>> The belly button, so that fat, omentum. Sounds like momentum but the fat inside the actual muscles of the belly pushes on the kidneys and the kidneys regulate your blood pressure so when they're being squeezed by the fat, they say, give me more blood I can't breathe down here and your body jacks up the blood pressure to get it there. He blood pressure at the high like a fire hydrant. Squirting away the delicate teflon-like artery of the arteries and your blood pressure is scraping the lining of the arteries, you have to fix it. What do you use? Cholesterol. You don't have enough of the good cholesterol. You have more of the bad cholesterol and put sh patches. 
>> Like a perfect storm of hell going on. 
>> Thankfully the sugar is okay. It's like broken pieces of shards of glass scraping but you can understand why if you have that percolating in the body, it is difficult to live life normally. 
>> Come on. You've shaken me to the rafters. What do I need to do? None of this surprises me too much. What should I be doing to deal with this? 
>> Number one thing for folks to do is automating the life so easy decisions are right ones and easier to make. So, for example, in the morning when you first get up, you need a little routine. Don't make decisions about the food until afternoon. Your breakfast, eggs. Which are just fine. Even with cholesterol issues, still fine because protein helps yo fight. So you want some protein within an hour of getting up. Could be yogurt with berries. Something that's got some protein and nutrients in there, sets you up for the rest of the day. And then a mid-morning snack, a handful of nuts. Something you adore. If you don't like it, you won't stay on it and then lunch could be something that you can deal with, a salad, salmon, something you like, deal with it. Don't think about it every day and then in the afternoon, start making decisions. Try to figure out what you will do. Second big tip to offer you is teas are great. You don't put a lot of cream in, fantastic with caffeine to stimulate your metabolism. 

[00:33:43]


>> I'm drinking a lot of coffee. Is that bad for me? 
>> Fine. Number one source of anti-oxidants in america and most people have black coffee with a little cream added and more cream and then nondairy creamer and sugar and then soon it's just basically a chocolate bar in the form of a coffee cup. 
>> What about chocolate bars? 
>> Incorrigible. No. Chocolate actually -- interestingly, 70% cocoa chocolate, which is not too sweet, is rich in flavonoids and just fine. If you love chocolate, eat it. That could be your snack. 
>> Here's what I'm going to do. I'm going to tackle this head on. I'm feeling run down by this and you have made me feel worse. I'm going to get you back in -- how long would I need to try to really deal with? 
>> You could dramatically change these numbers in six weeks. 
>> I'll get you back in six weeks. These numbers are going to get better. 
>> All right. You're on. You saw it here. 
>> Right. If I -- if I live long enough, we'll be back after the break to take some questions from my audience. ?????? ?????? ?????? We're lucky, It's not every day you find a companion as loyal as a Subaru. Love. It's what makes a Subaru, a Subaru. ] ?????? ??????

>> I'd really rather have high blood pressure. Nothing too personal with dr. Oz. A question from my studio audience. Not going to with that horror. Horrible visible. Let's turn first of all to judy. You have a question for the doctor. 
>> Hi, dr. Oz. 
>> Hi, judy. 
>> I'm 53 and in the throws of menopause. So my question to you is, why does it seem that some women have it a lot easier and some women have such a difficult time? Is it diet? Is it exercise or is it just luck? 
>> It's a combination. But let me if I can explain to everyone what's going on. A third of women have severe symptoms of menopause and a third bothered by it. Mostly sleep problems, emotional disruptions, hot all the time, and a third of people don't have any symptoms. Part we believe is on the body's fat content. You don't have much but when the body has fat on it, it releases hormones and more estrogen and that's why it's particularly a problem of men and women. For men losing their libido and converting testosterone, for women it causes breast cancer and ovarian cancer, things like that. Second big issue is the emotional reality of our lives. Now, menopause is not just estrogen but progesterone and like valium to women and why when you're pregnant you don't rebel against the thing growing inside of you and lets you deal with things you shouldn't have to deal with. You will tolerate transgressions that most people wouldn't have with high levels of progesterone. Fourth decade of life, early 40s, THE LEVELS BEGIN TO COME Down and slights that didn't used to bother you begin to bother you and that's a bigger issue as you add estrogen to the mix. The combination leads to the symptoms. Good news is if you shift from saturated fats in the diet to the healthier fats of, you know, vegetables, for example, the source of nuts and the like seems to help and black cohash is helpful. For a lot of women who have menopause. Worse comes worse, do not shy away from here moan replacement therapy. It is -- I don't think it's a danger for women as they're entering menopause for a short period of time. Let's say three to five years. Always take it with aspirin to reduce the chance of it causing clotting problems but that's where the average medical practitioner will agree to be using the drugs. 

[00:41:22]


>> Okay. Good advice from the doctor. A question about pain. 
>> Hi, dr. Oz. My question is in regards to pain. I have a preexisting shoulder injury, and I notice the older that I become the more frequent the pain is starting to appear. So my question to you is, is there a preventive measure to use to help alleviate the pain so that long term it won't turn in to arthritis? 
>> That's a great question. So many americans must suffer from pain in some capacity, long-term pain. What is the best way to try to deal with it? 
>> We tackled this on the show a lot. It's actually 116 million americans with chronic pain issues and while a lot of us run the pills but pills are not the right solution because they paint over the crack in the fodation of your well-being. So let's talk about your shoulder in two ways. The reality is most of the joints which have of course two bones involved aren't supposed to let the bones touch. When the muscles are weak around the joints, the bones begin to touch and true for knee pain because when you have knee pain, you hobble and your muscles atrophy and then they hit each other. Same for your shoulder. If the muscles are strong, they suck the joint apart and to prevent the bones from touching and causing discomfort. Second issue is amount of inflammation in the body increasing sensitivity to pain and omega-3 is hugely important and reducing pain syndromes and over the counter products, magnets and electricity devices, fda approved, put them on the shoulder, knee, lower back, and they are impactful and I would try them. Not very expensive and much safer than taking pills. 
>> Okay? Good advice. Let's turn to david. You have a question which is right up my attic, longevity. And how to get it, presumably. 
>> Hello, dr. Oz, mr. Morgan. I'm 61 and come from a long line of short lived people and granted following all the rules and regulations you have painted before, I most feel sometimes feel that genetics play a tremendous role and what's the balance between genetics and just good living? 

[00:43:31]


>> It turns out that about two thirds of how long you live is based on your lifestyle. Only a third is genetics. And the most genetic of all illnesses is alzheimer's. So many other conditions, heart disease, for example, is much more dependent on the risk factors we talked about. With piers with his study. 
>> Don't go on about it. 
>> Please. Turn and cough. But, you know, it does play a small role. A lot of folks get fixated on the date their parents died and count it down until you get to that moment. Very natural. The reality, though, is -- anybody right now can hear my voice who's in good health has a good chance of living to age 100 with the vitality they desire if they take proactive steps. 
>> That gives me perfect segue to you. Mimi, you are unbelievably 101 years old.

>> Fat pants and skinny jeans. And much more. Dr. Oz is back with more questions from our studio audience. Now, mimi, let me come to you because we discussed before, you're 101 years old. What is the secret to long life do you think in terms of health? 
>> Good diet. 
>> Yep. 
>> Exercise. If you can't do it standing up, get in bed and do it. 
>> Really? 
>> Do what in bed? 
>> Exactly. 
>> Good sex. 
>> Yes. You have the whole recipe. 
>> I'm proud of you. 
>> Mimi, let me ask you, have you ever smoked? 
>> Never. I never sit in the sun. 
>> You never smoke, never been in the sun. You keep out of the sun? 
>> Yes. 
>> Do you drink alcohol? 
>> Milk. 
>> Milk. 
>> It counts. 
>> So here we are. Keep out of the sun. No smoking. Very little alcohol. Just lots of milk and plenty of sex. What about that for a recipe or lifelong? 
>> It's obviously worked. I bet her blood pressure would be on the low side. 
>> Can we stay off blood pressure? 
>> Looking at places where people live a long time, the story resonates. Social structure around them, to make peace with what's going on in your life and sexy activity. And sex does count. 

[00:50:21]


>> I'm 48 and since I've gotten TO MY LATE 40s I HAVE SLEEP Problems. I wake up every night at 3:00 or 4:00 in thmorning. I can't get back to sleep. 
>> I have a 1-year-old daughter who wakes up at 3:00 in the morning. For people who have broken sleep, how important is sleep? How many hours should you get? And if you can't get enough, what do you do about it? 
>> The number one underappreciated health problem in america is sleep issues. It drives over eating, high blood pressure. 
>> I can blame my 1-year-old daughter? 
>> Assess, blame, condemn, that's what it comes down to. Sleep issues, you mentioned you're awake in the middle of the night. Anxiety n cause it, as we get older we need to go to the bathroom in the middle of the night. The mistake people make is turning on lights. Get one of those night lights or use your cell phone on the way to your bathroom so you don't trip over stuff. It will allow you to go back to sleep in an effortless fashion. 
>> What about technology here, we're in an era now of blackberries and mobil and computers and so on. How does that affect people's sleep. I have a feeling it affects mine, you're on these things all day long, until late at night. You can't help -- 
>> it disrupts sleep patterns. Our ancestors would see the sunset, because the sun rays are getting longer and longer, would turn on the sleep mechanism in our brain. When you're on a hdheld device or watching the tv even, it keeps you up. That bright light won't let you stimulate the hormone, it won't let you go to sleep. Same thing as if you wake up in the middle of the night. Turn the lights down, in tt half hour period, you will feel drowsy. One tip to the parents, it's a good time to tell your kids bedtime stories. The reason that happens, it's a great tool, the kids pu their defenses down a little bit. As they begin to fall asleep, you can tell them tips they can use in their lives. It's a great parenting technique. 

[00:52:52]


>> I'm going to get my flu shot from this man. 

[00:56:50]


>>> Back now with my special guest dr. Oz. I've been taking my clothes off not just for mimi's benefit, although she's rather enjoying it. I'm going to have my first ever flu shot. The myth about these is that you can get flu or flu like symptoms simply by having the shot, is that true? 
>> You cannot get the flu from the flu shot. It cannot give you the flu. It's based on the flu virus that occurred in southeast asia a few months ago. 
>> Please give me a muscle. That's it? 
>> It's the biggest muscle you've seen for a hile. 
>> That's it, one, two, three. And we're all -- 
>> it's not even bleeding. No blood even. Please. 
>> I'll give you a bandage so you don't cry. 
>> It's like a dull ache, really, it doesn't hurt. 
>> It's about the size of a mosquito bite. 
>> Should children have them? 
>> It's recommended after the age of six months we give it to our kids and frankly it's much more valuable in the really young and old. It's particularly the older folks that get the flu and can have heart attas related to it. This is one of those events that I think can be beneficial with low side effects. We have 130 million viles out there with to help people. Take advantage of it. Let's talk abo ellis island. 
>> It's iconic for our nation, it's a place where we got a second start. I think a lot of americans think their best years are behind them, they're not sure if the future is as bright as it was when they were kids. I think that's not the case. We have a wonderful series of reasons to be helpful, supportive of each other, it starts with simple things you can control. The reason I focus on the body. You can control what's happening in here. You can change the world outside of it, I think that's the mantra we need to take into the new year. 

[00:59:11]


>> How much of it is mental? 
>> Mental is where you win it all. If you look at the root cause of so many problems we face in our lives, it starts up there. You want to start with small actionable steps. If you realize the sacrednessp what we were given when we were born. And then you treasure it, as a temple of the soul which is what it is. It allows you to realize is this is what the action is, and at its core, it's not about competing in the journey of life, it's about taking a small time-out and realizing the wisdom of how beautiful whatever we were handed is.

>> Woman: The following is a paid presentation for the nuwave precision induction cooktop, brought to you by the makers of the number-one-selling nuwave oven. 
>> Announcer: When you turn on your cooktop, do you really know what the temperature is? No-- you're just guessing. Are you too busy to watch what you're cooking? Tired of all that burnt food going to waste? Worried about your kids getting burned or a loved one starting a fire in the kitchen? Well, those problems are a thing of the past. Introducing the revolutionary precision induction cooktop from nuwave, the leader in portable induction cooking technology. The nuwave heats up twice as fast, uses up to 70% less energy and is safer than any cooktop. Best of all, the nuwave is the only portable cooktop that gives you precise temperature control with the simple press of a button. Professional chefs create great-tasting meals by maintaining the precise temperature for the perfect amount of time. Well, now you can get professional results too, with the nuwave precision induction cooktop. 
>> The key to great food is knowing how to control the temperatures of what you're cooking. 
>> Now the p.I.C. Is allowing people at home to cook like you can in a restaurant. 
>> I know that when I turn it on that temperature, it's going to be that temperature. There's no guessing. 
>> Announcer: Not only does the nuwave give you precise temperature control, it heats up twice as fast as an electric cooktop. 
>> I put the water in the pan and turned around and the next thing I knew, it was boiling. 
>> What amazes me about p.I.C. Is how quickly it will heat up. Induction technology is just unbelievable. 
>> Announcer: And because there's no flame to catch fire, no hot coils to burn you, the nuwave precision induction cooktop is the safest cooktop ever invented. Look what happens with this egg: The pan is hot, but the cooktop is not. That's the magic of induction cooking. Make pasta in half the time. Melt butter with no chance of it burning. Melt chocolate to creamy perfection. Make sauces with perfect temperature control. 

[00:02:11]


>> It's small, it's efficient, it's clean and it's safe. 
>> Announcer: And because it's portable, you can take it anywhere, so it's perfect for buffets and outdoor parties. To tell you more, let's join bob warden and jenny repko at the nuwave test kitchen in chicago. Et me ask you, do you hate boil-overs and the mess they make in the kitchen? Do you hate burnt grilled cheese sandwiches or shriveled-up bacon? 
>> What about over-fried chicken that's all greasy, or dried-out oatmeal, overdone pork chops or charred steak? 
>> Well, what if I was to tell you that instead, you could now have perfect grilled cheese sandwiches, perfectly browned evenly every single time? 
>> All that cheese is melted in there, so delicious. 
>> Perfectly melted. And I could have perfectly grilled steaks set at 350 degrees that give me a perfect medium rare steak or however you like it and it's never going to burn. Perfect pork chops, and not only pork chops... 
>> Right, salmon, grilled vegetables, sausage, perfect every time. 
>> What if I told you, when you fried your chicken, it was going to be fried at the perfect temperature of 375, gently, perfectly, crispy, never soaking up too much oil. 
>> That's hard to do. 
>> In fact, that's the problem with the old stovetops, whether it's gas or electric-- you can turn it up and down, but because you don't have precise control, you're going to get boil-overs. Because you don't have precise control, you're going to burn the cereal on the bottom from time to time. And because you don't have precise temperature control, you can't help but burn a steak or a pork chop on your stove. You see, you're not the bad cook in the kitchen. The stovetop is the bad cook in the kitchen. 
>> That's right, and those days of bad cooking are over, thanks to the fine folks here at nuwave, makers of the number-one-selling countertop oven in the world. 
>> Well, they've done it again. You're looking at the new wave in stovetop cooking. Now, this ingenious invention will make your life a whole lot easier in the kitchen and a whole lot shorter and a lot more fun. We're going to show you how and why every meal-- breakfast, snacks, lunch, dinner, grilled steaks, fondues and buffets-- will be made perfectly every time.Now, for the first time, you can precisely control the cooking temperature. 

[00:04:23]


>> Announcer: Now you can live well for less with the nuwave precision induction cooktop. It's the most energy-efficient way to cook. The nuwave p.I.C. Uses induction technology. The secret is an internal series of copper coils. These coils generate a magnetic field within your metal pots and pans. The magnetic field causes invisible molecules to begin vibrating rapidly, creating heat, so the cookware itself heats the food. 
>> One of my passions are butter sauces. And one of the challenges of cooking a butter sauce is that if you get it too hot, you know, over 135 degrees, it breaks down. If you get it too cool, it congeals. The beauty of the nuwave p.I.C. Is that I can control the temperature exactly and keep the sauce for an extended period of time. That's such an added bonus for a professional cook and a home cook. 
>> Let me show you this unusual pan. Bob, what did we do here? 
>> Well, we actually cut a pan and cut a section out, because in here you can see we have cereal rapidly boiling, 
>> boiling away. 
>> I can put my hand right there. 
>> It's amazing. Move your hand. I'm going to put an ice cube right there. It's not melting. 
>> Because all of the energy is going into cooking your food. There's nothing wasted anywhere outside of the pan, so this is perfectly cool. So wipe that ice cube off there. 
>> O.K., I've got a cloth right here. Watch this, I'll take this ice cube, wipe it up. I'm using a paper towel on a burner. There's no fire, there's no flame, so it's so safe. 
>> And the minute you put the pan back on it starts boiling right again. >> Wow. 
>> Now, because we're cooking without fire, jenny, I'm going to take a sheet of play money and put it between the p.I.C. And the pan. Instantly it starts boiling again. 
>> Have you ever seen anything like that? Cooking through paper? 
>> So now we're cooking far more efficiently, we're saving 40- to 50% of the energy. >> Right. 
>> Isn't that amazing? 
>> Announcer: Seeing is believing. Look what happened when the nuwave p.I.C. Was put to the test on the streets of san francisco. 
>> All right, this is gonna blow your mind. This is the precision induction cooktop, and it is portable, eco-friendly and it saves you a lot of money, saves you a lot of time. >> Wow. 

[00:06:31]


>> Cooking time is cut in half. You see that the water's boiling now? >> Yeah. 
>> The great thing about induction cooking is it only heats the part of the pot that is magnetic, so everything else stays cool, so watch this. Ah! 
[Group exclaims] okay, everybody, put your hands on it. >> Isn't it hot? 
>> No, it just heats the magnetic part of the pot. This is at 110. You can leave it at 110 and it won't get gloppy, it won't get stale, it won't harden. 
>> And you don't have to be a big chef to cook. Like, I don't have time to cook. This would be great. 
>> Exactly-- this makes you look like an actual good chef. It's temperature-controlled, so I pop my fried chicken right in there and I know exactly what temperature it's at, and you know if you go down one, 10 degrees, boom, drops just like that. Can you do that on a gas range? 
>> Absolutely not. >> No. 
>> Not at all. >> This is temperature-controlled so you don't overcook it, you don't undercook it. 
>> I love the temperature control-- that can cook meat without drying it out. 
>> Man: Mmm! >> That's amazing! 
>> What do you think? 
>> Nice and crispy. 
>> You can fry, you can simmer, you can steam, you can fondue, you can do everything with this-- I love it. 
>> It's amazing-- I've never seen anything like it. 
>> I love that if you take the top... The pot off of the top, it stops and that the handles were cool. That's really amazing. 
>> And you know what the great thing is, you guys? It's portable. You can take this whole thing over to the table, plop it down and it will stay at 110 right in the middle of your guests and you can dip all day. Dip, dip, dip, everybody dip. And the best part about it? You can grill on the table. 
>> Man: Oh... 
>> What do you think about that? 
>> Mmm... 
>> So it's raining outside, it's the middle of winter, you still get grilled food. Will it change the way you cook 
AT HOME? >> Group: Yes. 
>> The p.I.C. Makes everything so simple. >> It looks like you ordered it from a restaurant. 
>> It does look like I ordered it from a restaurant. That's because I'm a good cook now with the p.I.C. [Laughter] 
>> Announcer: Introducing the revolutionary precision induction cooktop from nuwave, the leader in portable induction cooking technology.

egg: The pan is hot, but the cooktop is not. That's the magic of induction cooking.

[??????...] 
>> one of my most popular dessert dishes is called t chocolate three ways. It's made with a triple chocolate brownie, done with a chocolate espresso sauce that I do, and also white chocolate gelato with a little bit of rock salt and olive oil, and the p.I.C. Induction burner, I can keep it warm and adjust it in 10-degree increments and spoon the sauce right on-- it's perfect temperature all night long... Opposed to my double boiler that I had before, risking to get water in the chocolate-- would actually make it separate. So I love the p.I.C. When it comes down to keeping things warm, and that chocolate sauce can get out fast and I can move that dish out of the kitchen quick. Now the p.I.C. Is allowingpeople at home to cook like you can in a restaurant. 
>> Well, so far we've been showing you what you can do when you can precisely control low temperatures, like for perfectly melting chocolate or for simmering cereal. 
>> But, everybody loves a great steak and everyone hates it when their steak does not come out just the way they like it. But with the nuwave p.I.C., because it comes with precision temperature control, you won't ever undercook or overcook that steak. 
>> For grilling, use this great cast iron barbecue grill pan that can come with your p.I.C. Now, if you like your steak rare, check this out. It's going to be red and juicy on the inside, but perfectly brown on the outside. If you like it well done, it's not going to be burned on the outside, but it's going to be perfectly well done on the inside. How? Because the p.I.C. Gives you perfect temperature control. Look at this, first I seared it to 575, now I've reduced the p.I.C. To 375 and check out this laser thermometer-- exactly 375 degrees. 

[00:13:55]


>> Check out how 375 degrees gives us those great grill marks without burning or charring. 
>> And you know what I like with my steak? >> I know. 
>> A perfectly baked potato, which I cado right here in my nuwave oven in minutes. 
>> Or if you like my favorite thing, sweet potato fries. Whatever you make in the nuwave, it comes out perfect every time. [Chuckles] 
>> Announcer: According to the u.S. Department of energy, 50 cents of every dollar you spend heating up your gas or electric stove is wasted. But not so with your nuwave p.I.C., Because it uses induction technology. This infrared camera shows how a traditional cooktop heats the area all around the pot. But look how the nuwave p.I.C. Heats up only the pot. This means no more wasted energy. 
>> I love that I'm saving energy, that I'm only heating up the bottom surface of the pot where I need the heat to be, and I really think we're seeing a difference in our electric lls and I love that. 
>> I feel really good when I'm using the p.I.C. 'Cause I'm using less energy to cook whatever it is I'm cooking, andi feel like in my little way I'm doing something for the planet. 
>> One of the best things about the nuwave precision induction cooktop is it's portable. I can take it anywhere, I don't have to leave it in the kitchen. So I'll take it into my dining room and I'll set up my own egg station, so when I have visitors-- especially my family-- I can cook my own omelets, they can cook their own omelets, they can cook their eggs, they can cook pancakes and it's just this simple because I've got precise temperature control. And look how beautifully non-stick this is. All I have to do to make the omelet is tip it, the omelet runs back. I tip it again, it runs back. I'm going to be able to fill this up. So everybody can have whatever filling they like. I always like to have some mushrooms, some cheese, some peppers... >> And you know I like the healthy spinach, bob. 
>> Ohh... >> I just ruined his omelet. >> [Laughs] well, with the perfect green fry pan, we just simply fold that over, it's going to continue to cook while it's in the pan. I fold that out and look at 
this: My pan is clean, I'm ready to cook another omelet again. 

[00:15:58]


>> The heating is consistent, so I can set up a buffet with four or five of these and have different temperatures that are going to maintain. I think one of the biggest complaints is that sometimes the last people that go through the buffet, they get the cold food, and with the p.I.C., the food stays warm through the entire event and the guests really appreciate that, as does the host and hostess. 
>> My husband loves the nuwave p.I.C. Because he can grill indoors instead of having to go outside. He can actually join us as a family and we can all be together and cook. 
>> Announcer: Introducing the revolutionary precision induction cooktop from nuwave, the leader in portable induction cooking technology. The nuwave heats up twice as fast, uses up to 70% less energy and is safer than any cooktop. Best of all, the nuwave is the only portable cooktop that gives you precise temperature control with the simple press of a button. 
>> I love the temperature control. >> As you press the buttons, you can see exactly what the temperature is-- you can watch the water boil change. 
>> Mm-hmm. >> That's incredible. 
>> Anything you boil water for... [Snaps fingers] it's that quick. 
>> Announcer: Make pasta in half the time. Melt butter with no chance of it burning. Melt chocolate to creamy perfection. Make sauces with perfect temperature control. Gas and electric stoves have hot coils and open flames which can burn you. The nuwave p.I.C. Transfers heat only to your cookware, so it's 100% safe. Look what happens with this

>> Will it change the way you

It's your portable indoor grill, temperature-controlled deep fryer, festive fondue maker, timed rice cooker, healthy vegetable steamer, programmable slow cooker. 
>> If I had this, I would fry all day, every day. [Laughter] 
>> so I can steam my vegetables on top, I've got my couscous, my rice, my pasta underneath, everything is done, you come home from a hard day at work, 10 minutes, you got food for the whole family.

>> Announcer: The nuwave precision induction cooktop is the most convenient and efficient way to cook. You get the convenience of traditional stovetop settings plus the flexibility to control the temperature in 10-degree increments. Sear a steak to perfection or melt chocolate or butter without a double boiler. You can do it all with the nuwave p.I.C. The smart sensors inside ensure you'll create delicious meals every time by maintaining the constant correct temperature. It's like having a professional chef cooking for you. 
The result: No more mistakes, no more burning. 
>> It takes the human error out of cooking. There's no more guesswork in what temperature you're cooking at. It's very easy to just set the temperature at the touch of your fingertips. You can go up 10 degrees, 20 degrees, 30 degrees. In a matter of seconds, you're at that temperature. It's going to be perfect every time. 
>> Now we'd like to talk about the perfect temperature to fry chicken. Now, up to now we've been talking about what you can do when you have precise temperature control on low temperatures, like with chocolate, right? Look at that, jenny. That's been in there for hours, it's still not sticking, it's still the perfect, perfect creamy texture. 
>> Did you taste it? 
>> I know, it's almost unbelievable, isn't it? 
>> Delicious. Oh, and then we went to high-temperature searing. So with the push of a button, we got this to 575 degrees, seared the steaks, then we brought it down to 350 and we have beautiful grilled sausages, pork chops, salmon, even those grilled vegetables-- they were good too. 
>> Well, frying temperature is 375 degrees, especially when you're using vegetable oil. We want to hold that perfect temperature, so lookit here. We have a probe in here, we set this to 375 degrees. It says 375 degrees. Our chicken is frying gently, it's not going to burn. 
>> Here on my burner-- it's a typical electric coil under here... 
>> I can see jenny's been cooking over here. 
>> This is what happens. It's not safe. And not only is it not safe, I have no idea what the temperature is-- I'm just guessing. 

[00:22:40]


>> When you get that really good fried chicken at one of those fast food chicken places, it's because they have a very expensive deep fryer, they've set it at 375 degrees, they can use that oil all day long without it burning. Well, now you have that precise control at home with the precision induction cooker. Let me give you an example. In the test kitchen, we cooked over 200 pieces of chicken, and this is what the oil looked like. >> It looks like it just came out of the bottle. 
>> And this is breaded chicken, right? Here we cooked just 20 pieces of chicken on a gas stove, same results would have been on an electric stove-- you'd guess. You set it someplace between medium and medium-high, you don't know. The minute it smokes, it's gone, it's ruined. That's typically what happens. You have to throw the oil away. 
>> Yeah. Well, that gets expensive. 
>> Announcer: Third-party analysis shows the advantage of nuwave's precise temperature control versus conventional stove tops. Oil cooked with an electric stove contained 45% more saturated fat.Oil cooked with a gas stove contained 10 times more transfatty acids. Oil cooked with an electric stove contained over 90% more cholesterol than oil cooked with the precision induction cooktop. Now some of your favorite foods can be healthier with the nuwave precision induction cooktop. 
>> When you're cooking with frying foods, you're, um, you're trying to keep that temperature high so the grease doesn't get in the food, where you're not ending up with greasy chicken or greasy fish. And with the precision induction cooktop, I was able to master frying that chicken perfectly. 
>> Announcer: The nuwave p.I.C. Has been tested and recommended by the cooking club of america and is the safest cooktop ever invented. Did you know that every 85 seconds, a fire strikes a home in america? And most often, that fire starts in the kitchen. 
>> My very, very first fire was a 16-year-old kid who was cooking french fries on the stove and he forgot about them he burned his parents' entire house down. 
>> Announcer: Well, that will never happen with the nuwave p.I.C. There is no open flame, no red-hot electric coil to catch fire and as soon as a pot is removed from the nuwave, the conduction of heat stops. 

[00:24:43]


>> The safety features of the p.I.C. Impressed me so much that I'm going to send one to my mother. She's getting a bit elderly and forgetful and I'm always a bit worried that she might start a fire and the p.I.C.'S going to eliminate that problem. It's aat thing for the elderly to have and it's going to be a nice present. 
>> During our show, we've showed you what a difference the nuwave precision induction cooktop can make in your cooking. Whether you're cooking breakfast or snacks. 
>> Lunch, dinner, hors d'oeuvres. 
>> Whether you're grilling or griddling, when you have precise temperature control, it can make all the difference. 
>> Whether you're searing at high temperatures... 
>> Or whether you're having precise temperature control at only 110 or 20 degrees for perfect chocolate, you have got it. In 10 degrees intervals you can go from 120 to 130 to 140, all the way up to 575 degrees, which you can never get with your stovetop-- you're always just guessing. So to sum it up, what do you get with the nuwave precision cooktop? You get, first of all, speed-- it heats up really fast. 
>> And safety. There's no red-hot coil or open flame. 
>> And you get precise temperature control that you can never get with your old electric burner or gas stove.

=======================================================

>>> We've taken you behind the scenes with us as we catch online sexual predators. Men stalking children on the internet. 
>> What conclusion am I supposed to draw? 
>> She told me she was 13. 
>> This time more raw tape. 
>> Is there anything else you'd like to say? 
>> More elaborate excuses. 
>> You posed naked because you wanted to teach her a lesson. 
>> You can say that. 
>> Shocking behavior. 
>> I need you to just arrest me and take me to jail. 
>> And a new twist. The police -- 
>> turn around for me, hands behind your back. 
>> Waiting to strike. 
>> Do you have anything illegal on you? 
>> No. 
>> The arrests. 
>> I need to speak with an attorney. 
>> The interrogation. 
>> I was a police officer. I worked with the department of homeland security. 
>> This is "predator raw." 
>>> This was our third investigation in riverside county, california. These men would once again be walking into a house that we had wired with dozens of hidden cameras and microphones. They wouldn't know it obviously when they walked in, but every move, every word was being recorded, and it wasn't until after I told them who I was that the regular cameras would come out. After our second investigation, there was a lot of outrage from viewers as to why these guys weren't arrested. Perverted justice, the online watchdog group which provides decoys for these investigations, was approached by the riverside sheriff's department and they essentially offered to do a parallel investigation so that when we finished talking to these guys who showed up, they would be arrested, interrogated, and prosecuted. In the back of my mind, i wondered if all the attention we had received from the first two investigations would prevent men from showing up and I worried that we'd come back with nothing but video of me, you know, pacing around a kitchen by myself. That wasn't the case. 

[00:02:11]


>> Just hang out for a second. 
>> What's that? 
>> Just hang out at the kitchen counter for a second. 
>> All right. 
>> I'll wash my hands, all right? 
>> The riverside investigation was scheduled to last three days. By the second day we had 35 men visit our house, including this guy, who shows up to meet a girl half his age. He comes in, and he's jittery. He's jazzed up. And he goes to wash his hands. Well, I'm watching from the next room. And you know, I don't like every approach to be the same. 
>> Paper towel is right over here. 
>> Oh. 
>> So I grab a paper towel. He sees me and I hand it to him. And at first he just thinks oh, thanks. Then he figures out that this is going to be a problem. 
>> Have a seat right over on the stool there, please. Who are you? 
>> I'm chris. 
>> Chris. 
>> Yeah. 
>> And who did you come to see, chris? 
>> What's her name. 
>> What's her name? 
>> I'm sorry. You caught me off guard. 
>> He's, you know, shaky. He looks like he's on some kind of a drug. And in fact, later police found methamphetamines in his car. 
>> You came to see kelly. 
>> Yeah. 
>> How old is kelly? 
>> Kelly's way too young for me. 
>> Way too young for you? 
>> Yeah. 
>> Then why did you come here, chris? 
>> I came here to tell her that, actually. 
>> To tell her the truth? 
>> Actually, I did. I swear on my life. 
>> So you drove all the way from where? 
>> I drove from rancho, because I was tempted at first and then I was thinking on the way down here, you know what, I can't really do this, I don't feel right in my conscience. Like I'm a conscience type person. 
>> Yeah. I could tell you're a conscience type person by -- 
>> very, very conscience, yeah. I was going to come here and tell her I don't want to do anything. I didn't bring any condoms. 
>> You didn't? 
>> No. 
>> I mean, you can take them out of your pocket now. 
>> I know from the chat that the decoy had asked him to bring condoms. So I asked him. And he reaches into his pocket -- 

[00:04:17]


>> I brought this, but this is really watered down. You can even test it. That's way watered down. 
>> Way watered down. 
>> Way watered down. 
>> What is that? 
>> It's a 151. But there was this much left and I put a bunch of water in it. 
>> You did? 
>> Yeah. 
>> And why did you do that? 
>> Because I didn't want to -- i didn't -- I wanted to leave it here when I left and just say here, you can have this, and that's -- you know. 
>> So you wanted to come over here and say look -- do me a favor, though, and just keep your hands out of your pockets. Unless you're taking condoms out there have. 
>> That's fine. 
>> Just get what you're getting and put them on the counter. 
>> There's one but it's no good. I always carry it with me. It's always in my wallet, and i took it out of my wallet when i was in my car. Yeah. I have nothing to -- I honestly was going to come here and tell her I didn't want to do anything and tell her you know what, you're extremely young for this. You know? 
>> So you were going to come here and tell 13-year-old kelly that you didn't want to -- 
>> yeah. 
>> -- Do anything with her -- 
>> I really didn't. 
>> Here's some bacardi rum and a condom and -- did you transmit this photograph? 
>> Oh, my. I -- I sent -- I didn't know i sent that one. 
>> You didn't know? 
>> Well, actually, yeah, I did. But -- wow. I wasn't thinking of -- 
>> to a 13-year-old girl? 
>> I'm sorry. You're right. You're right. I wasn't thinking. 
>> And then he says, and we hadn't heard this before -- 
>> look at me. I didn't even take a shower. If I was going to do something like that, I would have taken a shower. You know? I mean, that's the first thing you'd do. 
>> How old are you? 
>> I'm 26 years old, sir. 26 years old. 
>> I really feel bad. 26 years of age and -- 
>> look, I really feel bad, dude. I don't even know how to tell you how I feel bad. Now, I was worried -- 
>> so now you go on and do this. 
>> I'm sorry. Because I was desperate sitting at home. I did. And it's not right to do. You're right. They should have control things on those chat rooms. 
>> Would you answer the door naked? 
>> And finally, when confronted with the transcripts, you know, he admitted that it didn't look good. 
>> I really wasn't even going to come down here. 
>> Yeah, but you did. 
>> I did because I didn't want to hurt somebody's feelings. I didn't want somebody to be absolutely hurt. Okay? And sit there and go oh, my gosh, he didn't show up. And I'm really like a conscious person. Look at me. I'm so dirty. Like -- 

[00:06:23]


>> I know. I tell you what's dirty is this conversation you had. 
>> Yeah, I know. I really should not have done this. I felt absolutely -- 
>> "yes, don't take my blank out of your mouth till I'm done" -- 
>> yeah, I know. 
>> Look, if somebody's telling me in the interview that they've got an addiction or a compulsion that led them to this situation, you have to say, look, you're an adult. Having recognized that, perhaps you should have done something about it before you ended up walking into this house. 
>> I was not fantasizing about a 13-year-old for god's sake. You know, it's not right to do. 
>> "Would you ever have two guys all over you?" 
>> It's just, like I said, fantasy type things -- 
>> what would you do with two? 
>> Yeah. It's just I wanted to hear. 
>> Now, do you know that it's illegal -- 
>> I figured that -- no, i didn't know it was illegal. 
>> Illegal to send this kind of material? 
>> I did not know that. 
>> To somebody who you believe is underage. 
>> I did not know that. 
>> That's against the law. 
>> Oh, my god. 
>> Here's what you need to know, chris. And that is that I'm chris hansen with "dateline" nbc. And we're doing a story -- 
>> please don't. 
>> You're welcome to leave. And takeour stuff with you. But if there's anything else you'd like to say, please tell us. 
>> No. 
>> If not -- 
>> when he left the house, i didn't know that he was on probation. Obviously, that made his situation worse when ultimately he was arrested. 
>> Turn around and put your hands behind your back. 
>> Please don't do this, please. Because I really wasn't going to do this. 
>> Go ahead and cuff him. 
>> Sir. Sir. Sir. 
>> What? 
>> Look, yes, the reality sets in right when I stepped out my front door. 
>> You're right. 
>> It did. 
>> You're exactly right. That's when the crime occurred. 
>> Walter babst did not stick out of a crowd. He's the kind of guy you'd see standing in line at the dry cleaners or the grocery store. 
>> I need you to just arrest me and take me to jail -- 
>> I need to talk to you first. @ 

[00:11:18]


>>> walter babst did not stick out of a crowd. 
>> I was watching you for like ten minutes. 
>> He walks in with pressed jeans. He was the kind of guy you'd see standing in line at the dry cleaners or the grocery store. Never stick out of a crowd. Clean-cut guy. But here we on a saturday morning, and we know that this guy is a teacher. 
>> Okay? 
>> Okay. 
>> We know how old he is. We know he's married. We know he has kids. 
>> Hey, how are you? 
>> Pretty good. 
>> Why don't you have a seat over there. 
>> Right away -- 
>> I'm under arrest? 
>> No. I want to talk to you. Have a seat. 
>> Go ahead and bust me. 
>> You know what? Sit tight. What are you doing here? 
>> Getting my ass kicked. 
>> Getting your ass kicked? 
>> Yeah. I knew it. I knew it was a setup. 
>> No. I need you to sit down, please. 
>> I need to you just arrest me, take me to jail, and execute me. 
>> I need to talk to you first. 
>> You know what? I didn't bring anything. I didn't want to do anything. Whatever. 
>> Well, why did you come here, though? Help me to understand. 
>> Because I'm a sick son of a bitch. I've never done it before. I talk about it online all the time. 
>> Well, help me to understand. What -- I mean, do you have a compulsion? An addiction to the internet? 
>> Yeah. Okay? I've never done anything with anybody except my wife, ever. 
>> Babst was very graphic in a conversation he thought he was having with a 12-year-old girl. They talk about oral sex. They talk about intercourse. They talk about all of the things they're going to do together and how he would teach her. And he says "i just chat about it. I just talk about it online. It's fantasy." But it ceased to be fantasy when he walked into her house. 
>> Now, who are you here to see? 
>> I don't even know. And you know what? I'm going to ask you something. Am I under arrest? 
>> You're not right now, no. But I need to ask you some more questions first. Now, you were here -- no, no, no. I want you to sit down, please. 
>> I need to go. Can I go? 

[00:13:19]


>> I want to talk to you a little bit more, first. Please just sit down. Would you like some water? 
>> No. I'm about to puke. 
>> I'm just -- you were talking to a girl named beth. 
>> Yeah, I think so. I don't know. You know what? I don't know. 
>> What did her profile say? 
>> Her profile said I'm in trouble. 
>> The profile said she was how old? 
>> She said 12 or 13. 12 or 13. So you know you were coming here for a 12- or 13-year-old girl? 
>> I'm totally screwed. I know that. But it's -- forget it. 
>> Do you have kids? 
>> Yeah, I do. 
>> Well, how would you feel if SOME GUY IN HIS 40s WALKED INTO Your house trying to hook up with your kids? 
>> I'd feel pissed. 
>> What do you do for a living? 
>> I'm in education. 
>> You're in education. A teacher? 
>> Mm-hmm. 
>> What grade do you teach? 
>> High school. 
>> High school? 
>> Yes. 
>> We see men from all walks of life. But when a teacher comes in, it's especially disturbing because obviously this guy has access to children. You've got to wonder what's going on at school or after school. 
>> Please, please, just sit down. 
>> I won't go anywhere. I'm not going to do anything. I'm going to go to jail. 
>> But I need you just to stay by the bench there, please. "What are you wearing at the moment? My boxers and tank top I sleep in." 
>> Please don't read it. I know what it says. 
>> And then you sent this, john. Is that appropriate in any way? You know, that's against the law right there. 
>> Is it? 
>> To transmit that to somebody you think is underage. Yes, it is. 
>> I didn't transmit it, though. No, I didn't transmit that to her. May I ask -- 
>> "do you see my pic in the chat window? Yeah. You think you would like that in you? How big is it? Well, you saw. Go get a can of coke. Dang, will it hurt? A little. Yes, at first." Now, what conclusion am i supposed to draw here, john? 
>> I can't say anything. I'm done. I'm fried. 

[00:15:20]


>> Well, there's -- 
>> please arrest me. 
>> Pretty much from the get-go babst seems to realize that 12 different things can result from his showing up and none of them are good. 
>> There's one thing you've got to know first. 
>> But when I tell him I'm chris hansen from "dateline nbc." 
>> And we're doing a story on computer predators. Now, if there's anything else you'd like to say -- 
>> he knows this is even worse than getting arrested. He knows that this is going to be on television. He's starting to figure out that this is going to impact his career as a teacher. And he's starting to figure out that this is not going to go over well at all at home. 
>> If you cannot afford to hire an attorney, one will be appointed to represent you before any questioning. Do you understand these rights? 
>> We had people from all walks of life, including an actor, driving up in a convertible sports car. it? Ya. Alright, another one just like that. Right in the old bucket. Good toss! See that's much better! That was good. You had your shoulder pointed, you kept your eyes on your target. Let's do it again -- watch me. Just like that one...

>> In riverside county we had a very diverse group of men show up. We had the teacher. We had an agent with the department of homeland security. We had people from all walks of life including an actor who we see driving up to our hidden camera house in a convertible sports car, and he's here to meet a young teenage boy. 

[00:19:51]


>> What's up? 
>> Hi. How are you? 
>> Why don't you have a seat right there? What's goi on? 
>> How are you doing? Chris. 
>> Good. How are you? You're chris? 
>> Yeah. 
>> What are you doing here? 
>> I was invited. 
>> By? 
>> By who? 
>> Who did you think you were talking to? 
>> I thought I was talking to luke. 
>> Luke. And how old do you think luke is? 
>> I thought he was 18. He told me. 18? 
>> Yeah. 
>> Want to try again? 
>> If he's young, I apologize. I didn't know. 
>> The pblem, chris, is that i have the transcripts. So I already know what you said. So it would be probably better for you to tell the truth right up front. 
>> I made a mistake. 
>> So why don't you just tell me what happened? 
>> First time I've ever done this. 
>> The first time you've ever done this? 
>> Yes. 
>> And how old are you, chris? 34. 34. And you thought it was okay to send this kind of material to a 13-year-old boy why? 
>> You're right. It wasn't right. 
>> You're asked, "you're not working? Because I'm rich. Laugh out loud. Way? Not way rich but enough to support myself comfortable. And not work? I do work, just not very often." What do you do for a living, chris? 
>> Just I work in background movies. 
>> In movies? 
>> And television. 
>> And television. And what do you do for movies and television? 
>> Background stand-in work. 
>> Like as an actor? 
>> Yeah. 
>> He says, "i want to be a model." You say, "i can see that. You're sexy enough. Really? Or are you just saying that? Nope. I think you're hot. Can we blank each other? Totally. How many dudes you been with? So tell me what you want to do in the shower." And you get into detail about what you're going to do with him in the shower, a 13-year-old boy. And then you say -- 

[00:22:01]


>> I really made a mistake. 
>> You can't help but feel sorry for some of these guys, but then when you go back and you reread the transcripts and you see the explicit nature of what was said, you feel less sorry for them. 
>> And then you say, "and you're not some cop on a sting operation?" I mean, that indicates that you are worried that you are doing something wrong. 
>> I know. 
>> Right? 
>> I know. 
>> "I normally don't meet guys as young as you." So you send this. 
>> He asked and I -- 
>> you know, that's against the law. No, no, I'll take that back. That's against the law right there. What do you have to say for yourself? 
>> I'm ashamed. I was going to turn around halfway and, you know, and then he calls and he's like what car are you in? I don't know. I just wasn't thinking right, and I feel terrible, and this was seriously the first time. And I knew I was taking a huge risk and I -- 
>> so you knew what you were doing was wrong? 
>> Yes. I mean, even when I got here, i was still kind of wondering like I probably shouldn't do this. 
>> Why did you do it, then? Tell me what was going on in your mind. 
>> Just -- 
>> I mean, do you have a compulsion? An addiction to this internet activity? 
>> Actually, no. I mean, I go online but it's, you know, majority just to talk and chat and all that. And, you know, sometimes if i meet a guy, you know, they are, you know, at least over 18. You know? And I normally have people come over to my place. And all that. And this was just the first time and I don't know why I did. And I know I made a huge mistake, and I -- 

[00:24:01]


>> well, you know how people will react when they see this. I mean, this does not look good. 
>> I know. I know. 
>> Chris, what would have happened if I hadn't been here? What would have gone on in this house? 
>> I don't know. 
>> I mean, you sure sound like you knew here what you wanted to do. >>Eah, but I'm -- 
>> I mean, it's hard to draw any other conclusion from this. And there's a -- there are a couple of different laws that have been broken here. The picture. And using the internet with the intent to have sex with an underage person. I mean, what am I supposed to do here? You tell me. 
>> I'll never do it again. 
>> You'll never do it again. 
>> You have my word. 
>> Why should anybody believe that? Do you see what I'm saying? So you've been in movies. You've been on television. Well, you're about to get another role because I'm chris hansen with "dateline nbc" and we're doing a story on computer predators. You're free to go, but if there's anything else you'd like to say we'd be happy to hear it. 
>> You have to wonder obviously when you're talking to an actor if he's not putting on an act then and there. But I think reality sunk in pretty quickly and I think he knew he was in trouble and he knew that this was not going to be a great day for him. So I think it was -- it was really him we saw. 
>> You'll receive a date to -- when you bail. They'll tell you when to appear in court. 
>> She told me she was 13. 
>> What was your plan with this 12 or 13-year-old girl? 
>> She had some video games. 
>> Sounds like you wanted to play more than video games. 

[00:26:02]


>> You can converse but it doesn't mean I'm going to do it. @ 

[00:29:10]


>>> milissa rehberger. Here is what's happening. A rpg senator says the issue of, quote, overall temperament will come up during senator hager's hearing to be defense secretary. The issue is whether he's suited to run a big department such as the pentagon. 
> About 200 residents met to talk about whether to tear down sandy hook elementary school where a gunman killed 20 first graders and six educators. More news later. Now back to "predator raw." 
>>> We had one fellow come in who was pretty cocky that he was going to come away from this unscathed. He tells me, "i know the law. I didn't do anything." I said, so are you a lawyer? He said, "no, but I'm a highly educated man." 
>> Hello. 
>> Hey, come on in. I'll be just a second. I've got to finish brushing my teeth. 
>> You're alone? 
>> Come on in. I just have to finish brushing my teeth. Just hang out at the counter for a second, okay? 
>> Many of these guys have an instant change in terms of the look on their face once I walk into the room. You see them come in. They're chatty. Some are nervous. Some are more comfortable. But as they have this dialogue with this decoy, they're starting to think that their dream date is going to come to fruition. And then I walk out. 
>> Why don't you have a seat for me, please, on that stool? 
>> And at this point, some of these guys still didn't know whether I was with law enforcement, whether I because a parent who walked in, or whether I was, you know, chris hansen with "dateline nbc." 
>> What's up? 
>> Not much. 
>> What are you doing today? 
>> Just came to meet julie. 
>> Julie. You came to meet julie? 
>> Yes. 
>> And how did you meet julie? 
>> I met her online last night. 
>> Online last night? 
>> Yes. 
>> And who are you? 
>> My name's andy. 
>> Andy? 
>> Yes. 
>> And how old are you, andy? 
>> I'm 23. 

[00:31:13]


>> And why did you want to come here to meet julie? 
>> Am I being framed or something? 
>> Framed? 
>> Because she told me to come over so we can watch a movie or something. 
>> So you can watch a movie or something. And she told you she was old? 
>> She told me that she was 13. 13. How about 12? 
>> No. She told me she was 13. 13. See, I've got the transcript right here. She says that she's 12. 12, female, riverside. 
>> I looked up her profile. It said 13. 13? 
>> Yes. 
>> All right. So 12, 13. She's pretty young. And what was your plan with this 12, 13-year-old girl? 
>> She had some video games. And we were going to play some video games. 
>> Video games? 
>> Yes. 
>> You ask what her est size is. She says 32b, and you say "sweet." You ask if she's ever had oral sex. You ask her to show you her crazy side. You ask her if she feels the need for sex, and then you say "if you do, I can fulfill that need." You say, "i'm a bit concerned doing underage." 
>> No. Well, our conversation was -- well -- 
>> I have the conversation. 
>> Yeah. She talked about it. And I talked about it. And then we -- we kind of sort of got to a point where we said, let's meet up and let's watch a movie or go for some food or something like that. Maybe play some video games. 
>> It sounds like you wanted to pl more than video games based upon this conversation. 
>> Well, it could be -- it could be anything. But -- 
>> it could be anything? Like you say you like playing in the shower. "Maybe we do that afterwards." Then you say, "unless I'm not talking to a cop who's going to arrest me tomorrow." 
>> Are you a cop? 
>> I'm not a cop. 

[00:33:20]


>> Many of the guys in this investigation assumed that I was a police officer. And the truth is I don't tell them who I am in the beginning because I want to get in their head a little bit. I want to find out what was going on that led them to show up at this house to try to have a date with a young teen. And so often they'll say, well, who are you? And I say, well, I'll get to that in a minute, but first i would like to know a little more about you. 
>> Did you bring condoms? 
>> No. 
>> You did not? 
>> Not planning to have any. 
>> But you say "do you like to have it in the blank doggy style?" 
>> Well, you can search me. I don't have condoms. 
>> I'm just telling you what -- you say "you like to have deep in your throat." What conclusion am I supposed to draw from this? 
>> Well, you can talk. You can converse, but it doesn't mean I'm going to do it, right? Unless I do it. Unless you catch me on point doing it. Of course. 
>> So you say I would have to catch you having sex with a 13-year-old girl before you could get in trouble? 
>> Before -- before you can put me against the law. Yes. 
>> So you're a lawyer? 
>> I'm not a lawyer. 
>> Oh. Well, you sound pretty familiar with the law. 
>> Well, I'm pretty much into academics. 
>> You're into academics. So what you're saying is for you to be breaking the law, you would have to be caught in the act having sex with a 13-year-old girl? 
>> Yes. Or let's say -- 
>> but you'd have to be caught in the act actually having sex with a 13-year-old girl before you could get -- 
>> or you have proof that you did it. 
>> Or you have proof that you did it. 
>> Yeah. 
>> Singh in his mind truly believes that in order for him to be prosecuted, he's got to be caught in the act having sex with an underage teen. That's not the case. The discussion he had online is enough to be charged with a misdemeanor, and showing up in caliia is enough to be charged with a felony. 
>> Well, let me correct you a little bit on how the law works. Because it's against the law to try to solicit sex from somebody who's underage on the internet. 
>> I didn't know that. I had no clue. 
>> I mean, come on. 

[00:35:20]


>> You can converse. Right? That's no problem. 
>> Why talk to somebody who's only 12 or 13 years old, though? Why not talk to somebody your own age? 
>> Can I just -- 
>> sure. You want some water? You got some. 
>> I think it's nervous reaction. You know? They don't know what to do. A lot of guys will pick up the chip and eat it or the cookie or the brownie or take a sip of water. I think they just don't know what to do sometimes and it's sitting right there and they just automatically do it. I think it's out of nervousness. 
>> So are you guys conducting a study or something like that? 
>> No. Actually, what we're doing is a story. Because I'm a correspondent with "dateline nbc." 
>> Okay. 
>> And we're doing a story on adults -- 
>> are you guys going to put me on the camera? 
>> Those cameras are rolling right now, yes. We're doing a story on adults who try to meet young teenagers on the internet. If there's anything you'd like to share with us, we'd like to hear it. 
>> Can you take me off the camera? 
>> If not, you're free to leave. 
>> Thank you. 
>> A lot of things were going through my mind after I'd finished the interview and these guys would leave. One, I'm hoping obviously that the arrests go smoothly. Two, I'm hoping that they go quickly so we don't alert the next fellow who's about to show up that, you know, there's an investigation going on here. And for the most part everything went smoothly. 
>> Hi. Good. Keep coming. Set your water down. Keep coming to the street. Go ahead and turn around for me. Put your hands behind your back. That's all right. I'll put these on. 
>> I can do interview or whatever. But can you please just let me go? 
>> Let you go? 
>> I have a school that's starting up and I haven't done any other crime inhe past. I'm very clean. 
>> This is the first time? 
>> Yes. 
>> Okay. 
>> I said have the sex fix and she said -- 
>> okay. 12 years old. The girl's 12 you're talking to. 
>> Why did you do it? 
>> You know what? 

[00:37:20]


>> What? 
>> It's going to seem crazy. 
>> Try me. 
>> Because it happened to one of my cousins. 
>> How old is that cousin of yours? 
>> She's dead. 
>> She's dead? 
>> Yes. cleaner, we replaced people with a machine. What? Customers didn't like it. So why do bankdo it? Hello? Hello?! If your bank doesn't let you talk to a real person 24/7, you need an al. Hello? Ally bank. Your money needs an ally. 

[00:40:50]


>>> Hello? Hello? 
>> Hello? Sammy? 
>> Hey, come on in. 
>> Where are you? 
>> I got to finish brushing my teeth, okay? 
>> Okay. 
>> Just wait at the counter for a second. 
>> Okay. 
>> We had already done two investigations. Going into this third one, i wondered to myself, what if nobody shows up? I mean, people must know that "dateline" is out there doing another investigation. Well, in fact, we had guys show up who had seen our previous shows and came in anyway. And daniel pulido was one of them. 
>> How are you tonight? Why don't you have a seat right there, please? Do me a favor and keep your hands out of your pockets. Okay? What are you up to tonight? 
>> Nothing. 
>> Nothing? 
>> No. 
>> Nothing or nothing good? 
>> Nothing good. 
>> Nothing good. 
>> No. 
>> Yeah. Who are you here to see? 
>> That girl on the internet. 
>> The girl on the internet. And what is that girl's name? 
>> I think it was sammy. 
>> Sammy. 
>> Yeah. 
>> Right. And how old is sammy? 
>> I don't know. She said she was 14. 
>> And how old are you? 
>> I'm 40. 40. And you think it's okay to -- 
>> no, it's not. 
>> -- Come see a 14-year-old girl at 40? 
>> It's not okay. 
>> Then why did you do it? 
>> You know what? 
>> What? 
>> It's going to seem crazy. 
>> Try me. 
>> But I was going to tell her that there's a lot of people do that stuff like that. I wasn't going to do anything to hurt her. Because it happened to one of my cousins. 
>> And then he goes into this long story about how one of his young female relatives had actually been killed by a potential predator. 
>> What happened to one of your cousins? 
>> She got raped. 
>> Really? By somebody she met on the internet? 
>> Yes. 
>> And how old is that cousin of yours? 
>> She's dead. She's dead. 
>> She's dead? 
>> Yes. 
>> She was killed? 
>> Well, the first time she got raped, she didn't get killed, but she got killed after that. 

[00:42:55]


>> Your cousin was raped by someone she met on the internet. 
>> Mm-hmm. 
>> And how old was she? 
>> She was 16. 16. 
>> Yes, sir. 
>> That must have had a big impact on your family. 
>> Tell me about it. 
>> And what was her name? 
>> We looked into pulido's story and we were unable to confirm that in fact it had happened. 
>> So based upon that, you decided to come over here and tell sammy about the dangers of talking to strangers on the internet. 
>> Yes. 
>> And what were you going to tell her? 
>> I was going to tell her that, you know what? If you keep doing this, there's no other people like me, but there's other people that are kind of dangerwus and they can do it to you. I know I show myself to her on the internet. 
>> What do you mean you showed yourself to her? 
>> I mean, I showed her my web cam. 
>> Yes. 
>> And the only reason, you know, because I mean people like that gets killed. 
>> I'm confused. You showed her what on your web cam? 
>> Me. 
>> You. Doing what? 
>> Naked. 
>> Naked. 
>> To get her attention. 
>> You posed naked on your web cam? 
>> Mm-hmm. 
>> So a 13-year-old girl could see it because you wanted to teach her a lesson? 
>> Well, you can say that. 
>> So this is like a tough love thing? 
>> No. I don't know. 
>> I'm not there to be a detective. I'm there to get information as a reporter. And obviously, I'm not going to let them take advantage of me. You know, if I'm get jerked around. But I'm there to get information, not to, you know, punish these guys. 
>> Well, what is it, exactly? 
>> I told you, to make sure, you know, she don't do stuff like that. 
>> You sent these -- you allowed her to see these pictures of yourself. 
>> Yes. 
>> This? 
>> Yes. 
>> That. That's you? 
>> Yeah. 
>> And you're, what, masturbating there? 
>> Playing with myself. 
>> Playing with yourself. 
>> Yeah. 
>> And you knew that a 13-year-old girl was going to see those? 
>> Yeah. 
>> And you did this just to teach her a lesson? 
>> Well, basically, yeah. 

[00:44:57]


>> Basically. Do you see why that's hard to believe? 
>> I know, yeah. It is. 
>> First of all, you lied and told her you're 30. And you're really 40. 
>> I'm 40. 
>> You say "you're cute, you don't look 13." You ask where she is. "Just asking because I'm naked." 
>> Right. 
>> You ever see a naked guy before? You ever feel a blank before?" 
>> Yeah. 
>> Yeah. "What have you done? Did you like it? How old was the guy? Will you give a" slang for oral sex. "But remember, I'm 30." It sounds like you wanted to date her, not teach her a lesson about the dangers -- I mean, i guess she would have learned about the dangers of the internet had I not been there and had she been here, huh? 
>> Well, you're going to make it sound like that. 
>> Have you done this sort of thing before where you try to teach a girl a lesson? 
>> No, this is the very, very first time. 
>> Very first time. Why even talk to somebody who you think is 13 years old? 
>> It was stupid. 
>> It was stupid. 
>> Yeah. Stupid. 
>> Why don't you -- 
>> I want to tell you straight up. I have a -- well, I had a stepdaughter. And she was -- and I have a 5-year-old kid. And my stepdaughter, and she was -- at the moment she was 14. And she was doing the same thing, playing on the internet. 
>> Right. 
>> And she met a guy, though he wasn't old enough, but he was like 17, but she was 14 at the moment. And I swear, I got so pissed. I even told my ex, you know what, I don't want her -- she's not going to go by the rules in the house -- 
>> so wait, wait, wait, wait. So you're telling me that you had a 14-year-old stepdaughter who met a guy on the internet to have sex. 
>> No, she met him, you know, just to be friends. 
>> To be friends. And that upset you? 
>> Yeah. 
>> Yeah. So you're upset, and you didn't want her meeting guys on the internet. 
>> I told her -- 
>> so you walk into this house to meet a 13-year-old girl. 
>> I know. It's stupid. 
>> Why is that okay? 

[00:46:59]


>> As a parent, you know, when somebody comes in and tells me a story like pulido did about how his stepdaughter had met somebody online, and he's all upset about that when it comes to his stepdaughter but he's willing to walk into somebody else's house and meet somebody else's daughter, that's the ultimate hypocrisy. 
>> Would you be okay if a grown man of 40 years old walked into your home to meet your daughter? 
>> Of course not. Of course not. 
>> Then why is it okay for you to do this? 
>> I don't know. It's stupid. Very stupid. 
>> So all that stuff about teaching her a lesson and being the protector, that's a big lie? 
>> No. It's what I was going to tell her, too. 
>> Why couldn't you just tell her on the internet? 
>> I don't know. 
>> Why couldn't you just say this is a bad idea, you're young, you shouldn't be doing this. 
>> That's true. 
>> Why not call the internet service provider, say there's a girl here who might be in danger. 
>> That's true. 
>> But you didn't do any of that, did you? 
>> No. 
>> You came here. Did you bring condoms with you? 
>> No. 
>> Are you sure? 
>> I did. 
>> You did bring condoms? 
>> Yes, I did. 
>> What part of the lesson -- 
>> I wasn't going to use them, i was going to give them to her. 
>> You were going to give her condoms. 
>> If you're going to do this, you're on your own. 
>> You just came over to tell her it's a bad idea to talk to guys on the internet, but if you're going to talk, here, use some condom. 
>> Yeah. 
>> Danny, it doesn't wash. 
>> I know. 
>> It doesn't wash. 
>> Well, I'm sorry. 
>> Why don't you start again and just tell me what your plan was tonight? 
>> Just to meet her. 
>> Just to meet her? 
>> Yeah. 
>> But the condoms, the sex talk. 
>> I know. I know. I've never done this before. I mean, I ha never been in problems with the police. 
>> Do you ever watch tv, danny? 
>> Yes. 
>> Do you ever watch "dateline" nbc? 
>> Yes. 
>> Have you ever seen our on computer predators? 
>> Yes. 
>> This is one of them. Now, if there's anything else you'd like to say for yourself. 
>> No, that's it. 
>> Then obviously, you're free to leave. 
>> Thank you. 
>> I think some of these guys truly believe that "dateline" can't be everywhere, and what are the odds of it happening to me. Law enforcement can't be everywhere. I'm not going to get caught. 

[00:49:06]


>> Walk all the way to the street. 
>> Stop. 
>> Turn around. 
>> There's another group of guys who I think, you know, are so caught up in the chats and the addictions of the porn sites that they get to a point where nothing will satisfy them but a face-to-face meeting. And that's when they blur that line between fantasy and reality and that's when we see them show up at one of our houses. 
>> Go ahead and turn around for me. Put your hands behind your back. 
>> I'm doing it out of fantasy. Not out of -- 
>> how can it be a fantasy when you sent a picture of your penis to her? 
>> I said the sex fixed and she said -- 
>> okay. 12 years old. The girl's 12 that you're talking to.! 

[00:52:50]


>> Turn around for me. Put your hands behind your back. 
>> Can you please let me go? I have a school starting out and I haven't done any of the crime in the past. 
>> Turn around and put your hands behind your back. 
>> One of the questions I was asked most after the second investigation was, "why aren't these guys being arrested" once they left. And I felt that we had some responsibility to at least examine a way where police could do a parallel investigation and these guys would face the criminal justice system once we got finished talking to them. We're talking about guys that brought everything from lubricant to condoms, alcohol, sex toys, these guys were prepared to fill their fantasy. Instead, once they walked out, they were cuffed, taken away interrogated and prosecuted. 
>> What's your home address? 
>> Do you have anything illegal on you? 
>> Sir, come on. 
>> When is the last time you used speed. 
>> I used it like two months ago. 
>> Two months ago usually means two days or two hours. 
>> I'm on probation. 
>> For what? 
>> For possession to use a line. I did use it -- 
>> this is smack. 
>> I'm not trying to get rid of it, sir. I really am not. 
>> Oh, look at that. 
>> This is only because I have to sign for a class. I hadn't used it since I got in trouble with it back in july. 
>> You'll receive a date to -- when you bail, they'll tell you when to appear in court. 
>> It doesn't look good for you because you're lying the whole time. We already have you what you said. When you say the whole time that all of this was for was to have -- to come meet a girl to play video games, that's a lie. 

[00:54:51]


>> You're talking to this girl about doing all kinds of things. 
>> Okay. I'm doing it out of a fantasy. Not -- 
>> how can it be a fantasy when you sent a picture of your penis to her? 
>> I said, out of the sex pic. 
>> Okay, 12 years olgd. 
>> Once the men were arrested, they were taken to a makeshift booking area where they were interviewed by detectives. We were able to video tape that entire process. But I didn't get a chance to see it until afterwards. And it produced some compelling moments. I mean, especially when it came to, for instance, the man who is an agent with homeland security. He showed up while they were arresting somebody else. So they had to grab him in the street. His interview with police was very telling. 
>> My father was a police officer. I was a police officer. I work for the department of homeland security. Okay. I understand you guys have a job to do and I'm not trying to tell you anything else other than that. I swear to god as god as my witness, I was not going to do anything with her. MAY THE LORD UP STAIRst STRIKE Me dead. I had no intentions on doing anything with that young girl at all. Period. I swear to god. 
>> So you can sit here and tell me that you didn't have any intent to have sex this time. Okay. I can believe that. But I'm telling you. I don't believe it that you didn't intend to have sex at some point with this girl. 
>> I swear to god. Sir, I swear to god. 
>> I guarantee you, it would have happened. You're no different. Every guy, first time, third time meeting, fifth time meeting. It would have happened because you meet the first time it's going to happen. There's no reason to meet at all. And reality sets in, dude. 
>> Look, yes, reality set ins right when I stepped out my front door. It did. 
>> You're exactly right. That's when the crime occurred. You were headed toward a meeting with a 13-year-old girl. That's when the crime occurred. 

[00:56:56]


>> I have it. Here's the thing. When it comes to the district attorney's office and what they're going to do to you, okay, listen to me. Listen to me. What they're going to do is that they want to see if somebody is sorry for what they did. If they know that they made a mistake and they owned up to it. But if you sit here and say all we talked about, to me, all we talked about was going to play video games, then guess what, they know that sane is lying. 
>> You have the right to speak with an attorney and have one present for questioning. If you can not afford to hire an attorney, one can be appointed to you. Do you understand these rights? 
>> Yes. 
>> Having these rights in mind, do you wish to talk to me in. 
>> No. 
>> Just days after babst was confronted and arrested, we find out he's back teaching. At the high school where he worked. And somehow, this slipped under the radar of authorities who didn't immediately report this to the school. Ultimately, it was reported to the school and he was suspended. But he taught just days after his arrest. Like nothing was going on. 
>> Right there. Second row. Right there. Just walk in. Have a seat right there. 
>> Over three days, 51 men showed up at our house in riverside county, california. At one point, there was so much activity at the house, the sheriff's department actually runs out of manpower. They didn't have anybody available to make the arrest. 
>> After we did the first investigation, I thought maybe we'd do one more and that would be it. But given how many men showed up, I started to think that we could do this in any town in america and we'd always get guys showing up. And I figured there was a lot more work to be done. And we'd be conducting future investigations.

=======================================================

>>> You've seen us catch online predators, men who use the internet to target children for sex. 
>> So, you've got a record? 
>> I'm guessing I do. 
>> This time, a dangerous convicted sex offender shows up in our kitchen. What were you convicted of before? 
>> Lewd conduct. 
>> Lewd conduct. 
>> And then there's this guy, he's seen us on tv, even seen men arrested in front of our house. Guess what he does? 
>> I didn't even know she was 13 no matter what she says. 
>> Hear what happens when a predator is caught in a trap of his own making. 
>> I'll shove that camera down your throat. 
>> From our setup. 
>> I'm going to leave. 
>> To takedown. 
>> I'm going to talk to an attorney. 
>> This is "predator raw." Riverside, california, was important, because it was the first time where we did an investigation and law enforcement did a parallel investigation. Once we finished, and the man left, riverside county sheriff deputies and detectives would make the arrest and begin their investigation. This particular investigation saw the highest number of men ever in any of our "to catch a predator" investigations. 51 men showed up in three days. You come here, have a seat. You know what? 
>> I know. 
>> Sit down, please. 
>> Okay. 
>> Set your stuff down on the counter. Have a seat. You knew what? 
>> I was in trouble. 
>> You knew were in trouble. Please sit down, relax. 
>> Actually, I'm not relaxed. I'm not going to give an interview. 
>> You're not going to give an interview? 
>> No. I'd just get in trouble. Just silly. I was just bore and silly. 
>> What are you doing here? 
>> I'm stupid. 
>> This is a guy who not only had been caught before by perverted justice and knew it, he had seen one of our previous investigations. And when he first showed up at the house, he saw police making an arrest just outside of our undercover house. So he leaves. He gets nervous. He calls the decoy. The decoys says, the cops are just doing a drug bust next door, don't worry about it. He comes back. Why did you do it anyway? 

[00:02:26]


>> I don't know. I was bored. I just -- you know -- 
>> so you're bored, you're going to come over and try to have sex with a 13-year-old? 
>> No, no, I don't know what i was going do. 
>> You're keith, right? 
>> Correct. 
>> What is your last name? 
>> Williams. 
>> We have done the research as best we can on their background to determine if there's a criminal history, whether or not they're registered sex offender, somewhere, of course, we have the chat blog. It's all there in black and white. Keith williams thought he was going to be meeting young teenage girl. What would have happened if i wasn't here, keith? You show up with booze. What else? 
>> That's all, booze. 
>> You got booze? You're going to booze up a 13-year-old girl? 
>> I don't even if she was 13, no matter what she says. 
>> What did she tell you? 
>> You're right. Can we get down to you can hang around, I'm telling you I am wrong. 
>> It's not your first time down this road, chat wise. 
>> I'll get rid of my computer, I'm not that great on it anyway. I'll get rid of it. I'll never touch the thing again. I'll go to meetings whatever you need me to do. It's not that I'm kissing your ass, it's just that I know that I'm wrong. 
>> So many guys deny, deny, deny but williams almost immediately falls on his own sword. I mean he's admitting to me, yeah, I was wrong, I shouldn't have done it, what's going to happen to me now? He wants to figure out how he can move through the process as quickly as possible. 
>> How much trouble am I in here? 
>> How much trouble do you think you're in? 
>> I'm in a lot of trouble. 
>> You know what you said online? 
>> I know. It is so much easier to type things, you know? 
>> Barely 20 lines into this, "are you a virgin?" 
>> Just boredom. 
>> Boredom? Why can't you find a hobby or something? 
>> You're right. Can I just -- can we skip on to this so I can get into trouble? Definitely wrong. Do I go to jail? What do I do? 
>> Often I feel it's necessary to read back significant portions of the chat because it will jar the guy into actually speaking to me. It's a way of getting these guys to tell their story. Many of them will just say, yes, no, I was wrong, I'm sorry can i go? Well, I want to know what was going on in this guy's head. Take naked pictures of her, you say? 

[00:04:49]


>> I don't know. I'm not denying anything I said, it's all right there. 
>> "What kind of panties do you have on?" 
>> Okay. 
>> "Nice. What size boobs do you have?" 
>> Yeah, I know. I'm just an idiot. 
>> "Can I videotape us?" Are you going sell it? 
>> I don't have a videocamera. 
>> "I want to watch it and masturbate to it." 
>> Eh. 
>> Eh? 
>> I'm wrong. You understand, I'm telling you that I'm wrong. 
>> Ever done this before? 
>> I've talked to girls. I never met anybody. 
>> Ever talk to anybody underage? 
>> I don't know. 
>> Try again? 
>> I don't know. I've talked to some girls but i never met anybody. 
>> Ever hear of a group called perverted justice? 
>> Yes, I have. I know about it. 
>> You're posted here, after talking to a girl who said she was 12. It's the chat log, keith. 
>> I understand. 
>> Take me inside your mind. What's going on? 
>> Just bored. I'm single, just bored. Honestly, that's it. 
>> No girls your age? 
>> I didn't say that. There is. I date people my age. You're right. But what I'm saying it's not like -- actually, 13 is way young and it's wrong, but I don't know, maybe something in my head goes 
-- 
>> something in your head goes what? 
>> I don't know. Something's wrong. You're absolutely right. I don't know. Like I said, I'll go to meetings, whatever. 
>> I think it's part addiction, part compulsion and ey develop these addictions and compulsions on the internet. There's 24-hour a day, 7-day a week access. There are porn sites. There are chats. And at some point the only thing that will satisfy these guys is the face-to-face meeting. The computer part doesn't thrill them anymore. They need that next level of excitement. Do you ever watch tv? 
>> Yeah, somewhat. Somewhat television. 
>> Ever watch "dateline nbc"? 
>> I seen that episode. I don't prefer to be on camera. 
>> I'm chris hansen. You saw the earlier episode? 
>> Yes, I did. It's not that I'm -- 
>> let me get this straight, you saw our earlier story? 

[00:06:50]


>> Right. 
>> You drove by this house and saw police out front? 
>> Yeah. 
>> Yet walked in here, anyways? 
>> Bored, like I told you. 
>> You got to want something to risk coming in here after seeing police out front. 
>> I just thought she might have been -- I don't know, maybe it's 
-- honestly I don't know. So I guess I'm going to walk outside and get arrested, i suppose. It's not that I'm a bad guy. And I don't think I would -- i just -- do we have to have the cameras on me? 
>> Well, we do have to. 
>> Fine. 
>> You're free to leave. 
>> I'm going to leave that there. 
>> You can take, too. 
>> I don't need it. Sorry, I didn't mean to bump into you. 
>> Some do know what's going to ppen next. In fact, it's interesting because sometimes we see guys stay and chat figuring, you know, I might as well hang out here for a little bit because i know what's going happen once i leave. 
>> Oh, man, I never done this before. I don't know what I was thinking. Just bored. 
>> This was a guy who knew he was in trouble, knew what he had done was wrong. He was going to work his way through it as quickly as possible. 
>> How long will I have to be in jail before I can get out? 
>> I'll shove that camera down your throat. 
>> I don't think you're going want to do ?????? I wish my patients coule what I see. ?????? ?????? that over time, having high cholesterol and any of these risk factors can put them at increased risk for plaque buildup in their arteries. So it's even more important to lower their cholesterol, and that's why, when diet and exercise alone aren't enough, I prescribe crestor. In a clinical trial versus lipitor, crestor got more high-risk patients' bad cholesterol to a goal of under 100.

>>> He walks in. He makes himself right at home. I mean, he basically acts as if he were showing up at an old friend's house. 
>> I want to take a shower. 
>> I don't know. 
>> We clearly have the element of surprise. I mean, these guys sometimes don't know whether to think, I'm the mad dad who came in unexpectedly, the police, or an investigative reporter. And so, their mind is whirling away trying to figure how they're going to deal with this situation. And sometimes they just decide they're going to, you know, act like they did nothing wrong. Why don't you come on over here and have a seat, please. 
>> How you doing? 
>> Good. How are yo 
>> all right. 
>> Sit down. What is go on? 
>> I'm meeting a friend I met on internet. 
>> Really? Allen did not miss a beat. It was almost as if, when i walked in, I was somebody he had met before. No admission at all that this was a bad situation. That what he was doing here constituted a felony. You know, he was here to have a date with a 13-year-old. And yet, now he's going to be my best friend. And who's your friend who you met on the internet? 
>> Sam. 
>> Sam? 
>> Yes. 
>> And sam is who? 
>> A person I met off the internet. 
>> Man, woman? 
>> Oh, it's a girl. 
>> It's a girl? 
>> I don't know how old. That's why I'm here, I'm just curious. 
>> They can say they're curious and I'm sure they are curious. But when you go back and read the chat log, it's not hard to see that they were more than curious. They were there to actually have a sexual liaison. 
>> It was curiosity that absolutely curiosity that got me. 
>> And what's your name? 
>> Dan. 
>> Dan. And what's your last name? 

[00:13:24]


>> Allen. 
>> Allen. We knew that there was a conviction in his past. It had to do with a domestic incident, stalking. He had gotten in trouble for that. So you know here he is, some years later, apparently willing to commit another crime. How old are you, dan? 47. 47. But you know -- 
>> you say, just wait one second, and you say -- wow, 13. Am I too old? Nah. Am I too young? I hate to say this, but you're not. Why do you hate to say that? Because it's like I'm old pervert, but girls your age are much more fun. 
>> I have conversations with people turn out to be guys, more than half the time, you know or turn out to be a very nice woman and that's basically how it goes out there. I don't -- you know what I mean? 
>> But if somebody tells you they're a 13-year-old girl don't you see something inappropriate about that? 
>> Maybe so, but I had my -- I -- my big doubts that she was 13. 
>> But if somebody says they're 13 maybe you should just stay away? 
>> Well, you're absolutely -- you're absolutely -- like I say 
-- a couple past experiences so that they're never 13, you know. 
>> So youited people online? You visited people you met online who said they were 13 before? 
>> Well, yeah, 13 or 15. 
>> So, it's not the first time you've done this? 
>> Well, wait a minute. It's -- I've never met a 13-year-old girl from online. 
>> I'm saying did you ever meet somebody that said they were 13 online? 
>> No, not 13. 16 in my area, and it was a -- it was a guy that was -- I don't KNOW, MID 20s, YOU KNOW? Who had a big ugh on me. But that's why I was just -- i was just very curious. 

[00:15:25]


>> There were a few moments when I was talking to dan allen where I thought, you know, based upon the look in his eyes, that this could go a couple different ways. One of them not so good. 
>> I wish I could just run home with my tail between my legs and I'd feel like apologizing but i mean, like, it's cyber. Who do I apologize to? And -- I don't know. I feel sick. 
>> Well, I am not the police. But I am chris hansen with "dateline nbc" and we're doing a story on computer predators. He knows that he's a bad situation once the camera guys come out. And so he's not going to try to be my pal anymore. He's mad. 
>> Well, you better -- I'll shove that camera down his throat. 
>> I don't think you're going to want to do that. 
>> Why's that? 
>> I don't think you want to do that. We can't keep you here. You're free to leave, obviously if you want to go. Had he decided to pursue the more aggressive route and had he gotten physical, I mean, we d security there, and security people would have stepped in to prevent that from happening. 
>> Okay. But can I talk to you outside? 
>> You can say whatever you want to say -- 
>> no, I mean -- obviously want to say something off camera. 
>> I can have the cameras turned off at this point. 
>> Well, then I'd like to say that pretty much I think that you have it all wrong. But your point's well taken. 
>> If you want to follow up, my e-mail's on here, phone number's on here, you can call me, talk to me if you want to follow up. 
>> Hi, guys. Pretty weird. Cut. 
>> I know that what he wants to do is get me outside off-camera and try to convince me he shouldn't be part of our investigation, and that's just not an option. And so, it sounds weird but I'm trying to be polite and decent with the guy, but yet at the same time suggest that, okay, it's time to go. You're free to leave at any time. I'm not going to try to keep you here. If you have anything else you'd like to say, fine. 

[00:17:53]


>> No, you're just doing a story and I got caught up in it, is what you're saying. But it's probably a very good story. 
>> Anything else you'd like to 
-- 
>> nope. 
>> You're free to go. Why don't you come out the front way, if you'd like 
>> sure. 
>> I think sometimes these guys are trying to figure out how they're going to leave. If they go out a different door are they better off doing that? Most of these guys are not harden criminals who are going try to run from police. Once they see that they're going to be arrested, that a number of deputies or officers are there they pretty much cooperate. How old are you? 
>> I'm stupid. 
>> How old? 
>> Thoroughly, completely stupid. 
>> How old are you? 56. 56. 
>> I'm stupid. I've never done such a thing. God, please, please just go. Uhh, it's next month, actually... EDDIE continues

[00:21:50]


>>> You know, I get asked all the time, what do these guys have in common? And what I say as an answer is that the vast majority of these guys do not stand out of a crowd. They don't have the word "predator" tattooed to their forehead. Hello? 
>> Hey. Go ahead and hang out at the kitchen counter, because I have to brush my teeth. 
>> Okay. 
>> What's in the bag? 
>> Oh. Nothing really. 
>> Good evening, how are you? Why don't you have a seat on the stool, please. 
>> Okay. 
>> Do me a favor, just take your lands out of your pocket, if you would. What's going on? 
>> I'm going to leave. 
>> No, no, I think -- trust me, you want to chat for a minute before you do that. 
>> Okay. I want to go, please. I -- I don't -- 
>> what are you doing? I want to see what's in your pocket. 
>> Just a cd. 
>> Of what? May I see it? 
>> Songs I have. 
>> Songs? 
>> Yes. 
>> In stephen coates, you've got a guy who has a good job, successful executive. He composes his own music. He's made his own cd. He's got his own website. He has a life, a wife, a son. It's never ceases to amaze me in how one part of a guy's life it can be so totally normal, successful, and yet they have this secret dark side where they're trolling internet chat rooms for dates with teenagers. And what are you doing here, stephen? 
>> I was doing something that i shouldn't be. 
>> And what is that? Why don't you tell me? 
>> Sir, I just want to go, okay, please? 
>> What are you doing here trying to meet a girl who told you she was 13 years old, stephen? 
>> I never done such a thing and I didn't want to do it. 
>> Why did you do it, then? 
>> Because I -- I'm stupid. 
>> How old are you? 
>> I'm stupid. 
>> How old are you? 
>> I'm thoroughly, completely stupid. 
>> How old are you? 56. And I'm stupid. And I've never done such a thing. God, please, please, just go. 

[00:23:53]


>> You can tell his first instinct was turn and go. Then he thought better of it. We had a chat for a short while. You talk about sex and things like that, anything with boys or men in a sexy way? 
>> Sir, please. I beg of you, believe me, i never done such a thing. I'm crazy. And I'm wrong. And I just want to leave. And I just want to have this -- okay, please, please I beg of you. 
>> This is a pretty sexually charged conversation for somebody your age to have sex with somebody who says they're 13. 
>> Please, sir, I know. And I just -- I don't want -- i want it to end. I really want it to end and just go. 
>> Well, there's a couple things you need to know. One is I'm chris hansen with "dateline nbc" and we're doing a story on adults who try to meet children on the internet. Now there's -- there's nothing that I can do to make you stay here, but if there's anythg else you'd like to say, we'd like to hear it. 
>> I'm sorry. 
>> And he leaves to try to avoid being on camera anymore and as he gets to the end of the driveway, riverside county sheriff's department is there. And this is when he really starts to come unglued. 
>> Please I beg of you. I just -- 
>> you beg of me what? 
>> Just let me go, please. Please let me go. 
>> Are you serious? 
>> I'm very serious. I never done such a thing in my life. I never want to do it again. I'm just -- I just want to go, please? 
>> Since you're the first person to say that today, we'll let you go. 
>> I'm a good guy, I've got a good job. I hadn't done anything yet, you know? But the reality is, the chat, the fact that they showed up, you know, that's a crime right there, in the eyes of the police. 
>> I've read all of your text messages that you had with this young female, all right? It's all there. All right? And you repeat several times, erase our conversations, you know, I can get in a lot of trouble with this. You knew exactly what you were doing. 
>> Yes, that's right. 

[00:25:53]


>> There's no doubt in my mind, or anybody that sees this, you knew exactly what you were doing. 
>> That didn't mean I was actually going to do. 
>> Sitting on your computer at home and enjoying the play, talking is one thing, all right? Showing up at her house is a clear indication that your intent was to complete those three acts you talked about, anal sex, vaginal sex and oral sex. 
>> No, no, no, no, no, no, no. I never said anything about having vaginal sex. 
>> Yes, you did. 
>> Well, let me put it this way. Whatever, I mean, you know how it is online. You talk to people you don't know who you're talking to and it's just -- I mean for -- 
>> he was in control of his life, up until that very moment and he couldn't control the fact that he was going to be on television, and he couldn't control the fact that he was going to be arrested. And that, I think, freaked him out. 
>> What did you think was going to happen? 
>> I thought she was going to ask me to take her for a ride to get a burger, I would have talked to her a little bit. 
>> Please. Nobody's going to be home. Nobody's going to see us. Your brother's going to be gone, your parents are going to be gone. I just told you that I just read this, all right? 
>> I know, but that doesn't mean I would actually do it. There's so much fantasy online. 
>> You should have kept the fantasy at your house. That wouldn't have been an issue. 
>> I know. 
>> Once you cross the line you crossed that fantasy's no longer an issue as far as fantasy online. 
>> It's a mixture of things. All of them tragic. If in fact a 13-year-old girl had been there, and there had been a sexual relationship and it's going to damage that child for the rest of his or her life. But at the same time, you know, here is a guy whose family is going to get this news, whose wife is going to say, what? His kids are going to say, what? And then that is equally as tragic, I think. 

[00:27:53]


>> So you're on probation for having sex with a boy how old? 15. 15. And now you're in this house to meet a 13-year-old boy? And they have to move it over? My doctor does not have to do that anymore.

>>> National rifle association president says conongress is not likely to pass an assault ban. Chavez has beaten his lung infection. He will stay in the cuban hospital for cancer treatment. And in australia, massive dust storms like this one. Over 130 are burning there. Now back to "predator raw." 
>> Hey. Are you out there? Hey. 
>> I'm brushing my teeth real fast, okay? 
>> What happened? 
>> I have crap stuck in my teeth. 
>> Your teeth? 
>> We were watching from the next room on the monitor, as robert lyons came into the backyard and started to open the sliding door to come into the kitchen. 
>> Just hang out at the kitchen counter for a second, okay? 
>> What happened? 
>> Do you want a drink or something? 
>> No, that's okay. 
>> All right, hang out at the counter. I got to go get my shirt on? Sit down at the counter for a second. I got to go get my shirt on. 
>> He was leery, suspicious. And sneaky looking. You know he looks in and peers around and as it turned out, lyons had good reason to be suspicious. It wasn't his first time down this path. 
>> Robert lyons, lewd acts of a child 14, 15 years old. So same sort of sex rap. Robert m. Lyons, but what is crazy is that -- check this out 
-- he says in the chat that he is 28. 
>> That ain't no 28. 
>> There's no way he's 28. 
>> In fact he was 68 years old. We see a lot of fibbing online about ages, but it's usually five or ten years, you know, not 40 years. 
>> This is his picture, right? That's his sex offender arrest picture. It's the same guy. 

[00:33:12]


>> Yeah. Yeah. 
>> Everything is the same. 
>> When you think that this guy had just recently pleaded guilty to having sex with an underage boy, that he had the guts to tell somebody he was 40 years younger than he really was, and then to follow through on the chat by actually showing up, i mean, it's stunning. What was your plan here today, robert? 
>> No plan. 
>> No plan at all? I've got the transcripts of your conversation here. 
>> I'm sorry? 
>> I've got the transcripts of your conversation here. You say to him, I'll be your girlfriend and you be my boyfriend, huh? He says are you a girl? You say, no, oh sometimes I wish I was. You say what do you wear? He says, panties, bra. It's a pretty sexually charged conversation, robert, to have with a 13-year-old boy. What conclusion am I to draw from this? 
>> Just conversation that probably was offhanded. 
>> What it sounds like, robert, is that you wanted to come here to have a sexual liaison with a 13-year-old boy. 
>> No, it was not my intention. 
>> What was your intention? 
>> Just to talk, whatever. 
>> The problem, robert, is, is that your history would contradict tha given the fact that you are a registered sex offender, isn't that correct? Correct. 
>> And what were you convicted of before? 
>> Lewd conduct. 
>> Lewd conduct. Specifically what was that conduct? 
>> With a minor. 
>> What did you do with a minor? 
>> Sexual. 
>> In what way sexual? 

[00:35:15]


>> There was intercourse. 
>> Intercourse. So you had intercourse with an underage boy? 
>> Yes. 
>> Even though we do as much background research as we can do on these guys, there are still certain things that you only find out once you are face-to-face and you can have a discussion. You were convicted of that. How long were you in prison for that offense? 
>> I wasn't in prison. 
>> You weren't in prison? You got probation? 
>> Correct. 
>> How long were you on probation? 
>> Still on probation. 
>> You're still on proba now. So you're on probation for having sex with a boy how old? 15. 15. And now you're in this house to meet a 13-year-old boy? How does that look, robert? 
>> I didn't know he was 13. 
>> He said so. He was just coming over to talk and hang out, he was not going to deviate from the script one bit. He was going to stick to his story until the bitter end. What would have happened if i wasn't here, robert? 
>> I don't know. Probably would have talked and met up, that's it. 
>> Talked and met up. Is that what you did with the 15-year-old boy in the last case? 
>> I made a mistake. And I didn't know he was 15. He told me he was 18. 
>> What did you learn from your previous mistake? 
>> I learned to be more careful, stay away from -- not to be subjected to the proposition or making propositions to anybody. 
>> But robert, you're in a home, trying to meet a 13-year-old boy. You had to register as a sex offender? 
>> Correct. 
>> Do you see a counselor? 
>> Correct. 
>> You do? And when was the last time you saw your counselor? 
>> Two weeks ago. 
>> Two weeks ago. Did you talk about your sexually charged conversation on the internet with a 13-year-old boy? 
>> No. 

[00:37:16]


>> Why did you tell 13-year-old luke that you were 40 years younger than you actually are? 
>> Because I think the internet is a place where you just -- it's so pretension. 
>> A pretension. 
>> You pretend to be this, pretend to be that. 
>> Is this pretend what you're doing here today? 
>> No. 
>> Seems pretty real to me. 
>> This is real. 
>> It's real. 
>> You showing up here is real. 
>> What does that say about your ability to distinguish between what is pretend and what is real? 
>> There's a fine line between at. It's kind of -- 
>> you know what could happen to you now? As a convicted sex offender? 
>> Correct. 
>> Showing up here? What should happen to you? 
>> I'm not really sure. Probably more enforcement of -- of my counseling. 
>> Well, robert, I've got to tell you something. I'm chris hansen with "dateline nbc" and we're doing a story on computer predators. If there's anything else you'd like to say to us, we'd like to hear it. If not, there's obviously nothing I can do to keep you here and you're obviously free to go. He knows he's in significant trouble. I mean, ifou go back and look at record from the previous case 
-- 
>> drop it. 
>> It would appear that he perhaps got probation instead of prison time, because the 15-year-old boy he pleaded guilty to having sex with told him he was older. 
>> How old, 68? 
>> And he wasn't going to catch a break on this one, because it said in the transcript, this boy was 13. 
>> Robert lyons. I thought it was somebody else 
>> clearly he's had experience going through the criminal justice system, but it became pretty clear immediately during the police interview that lyons knew his way around the system and saw no benefit whatsoever in having any meaningful conversation with detectives. 

[00:39:27]


>> Why are you here? Tell me what's going on today. What are you coming over to the house for? 
>> At this point I think I will talk to an attorney on this. 
>> Okay. 
>> So, a month ago, you got caught by perverted justice. 
>> I didn't get caught. 
>> Talking to somebody who said they were underage? 
>> Yes. 
>> And you didn't learn any lesson about that? flo? is? Are you flo? Yes. Is this the thing you gave my husband? Well, yeah, yes. The "name your price" tool. You tell us the price you want to pay, and we give you a range of options to choose from. Careful, though -- that kind of power can go to your head. That explains a lot. Yo, buddy! I got this. Gimme one, gimme one, gimme one! The power of the "name your price" tool. Only from progressive. understands the need. Bright students are getting lost in the shuffle.

>>> I've got the transcript, and she doesn't say anything about 18. The only thing she says is that she's 13. They have to make up this story on the spot. And when you have to make up a story, that quickly, you know it can sometimes be difficult to ad-lib especially when confronted with transcripts and the fact that you've brought certain things that you promised to bring a young teenage girl. 39? And why do you think it's okay for a 39-year-old ome visit a 13-year-old? 
>> It's not. 
>> Then why did you do it? 
>> I don't know. I've never done it before. 
>> Really? 
>> Seriously. 
>> Do you have a plan for tonight? 
>> No, not really. I mean, I -- no definite plan. She kept saying something about sex or whatever and I told her i wasn't coming up to hook up. I just wanted to hang out, talk with her. 
>> That's hard to believe especially when you go back and look at the chat logs and the fact that they talked about bringing certain kind of alcoholic beverage and here he is with that exact type of wine cooler. What do you got in the bag there? 
>> She asked me to bring some of that for her mom. She said she was drinking some of her mom's coolers. Or something. 
>> For her mom? You know, I have the transcript. 
>> But she said she was drinking some -- 
>> that's not what she said. 
>> Yes, she did. She wanted me to bring some of those. 
>> For her. She likes them. 
>> She was drinking the ones out of her mom's refrigerator for her. I guess it would be to replace them. 
>> I don't know if that was off the top of his head but that's what he was going with. He stuck with that story to the bitter end. You ask her ever had sex with a guy before? Yeah, one time. When was that? How was it? So, you think you can handle yourself then with an older man. 

[00:45:09]


>> Just making conversation. 
>> Maybe I can have a mom and daughter thing? 
>> Yeah, stupid. 
>> You seem a little worried in this internet conversation about the possibility of her being a cop. 
>> You know I feel strange when I talk to people online because you don't know who they are. 
>> She pretty much said who she is. 
>> She said she wasn't a cop. Or anything like that. 
>> That's right. 
>> She kept asking me the same thing. I said no. 
>> You say, I got caught. 
>> Well, there was like an online detective or whatever that was in one of the chat rooms or whatever. And she said that she was undercover, whatever, for, i don't know what group it was or whatever. She didn't give me a groups name. 
>> Perverted justice. 
>> I think so. 
>> You got caught one time by perverted justice? 
>> I wasn't doing nothing. I was just chatting. No sexual contact. 
>> How long ago did this happen? 
>> A month ago or so. 
>> A month ago you got caught by perverted justice? 
>> Well, I didn't say I got caught. She just said -- 
>> talking to somebody who said they were underage? 
>> Yeah. 
>> And you didn't learn any lesson from that? 
>> I guess not, not really. 
>> Did you send her pictures? 
>> What was on my little window. In my box. 
>> And what was on your little window? What kind of pictures? 
>> Pictures of me. 
>> What kind? 
>> My face. 
>> Apparently he got another picture of somebody else's genitalia and sent that, and I'm not sure why somebody would do that, but that's what he told me he did. I mean maybe I'm just getting older or maybe I'm square, but i just had no idea that so many people were sending these sorts of pictures to each other on the internet. 
>> Just curious to find out if somebody's interested. I'm not looking for girls to have sex with online. It's all conversation. 
>> All role playing? 
>> Basically. That's what being online is? You somebody you're not normally in person or life or your social life, whatever. You just -- you can be whoever you wanted. 

[00:47:13]


>> What should happen to you? 
>> I don't know. The words might say I was coming up here -- I didn't come here with condoms. I told her I didn't want to hook up. Curiosity got the best of me. I don't know. 
>> You could have stopped chatting. 
>> I could have, right. I could have. 
>> Well, scott, there's a couple things you need to know. One is that I'm chris hansen with "dateline nbc" and we're doing a story -- now he thinks, I suppose that okay, fine I just have to leave here and I'm golden. Well, he finds out differently when he gets to the end of the driveway and runs into the riverside county sheriff's office. 
>> When you got here and then when you got here you got cut off before you could do that. 
>> Not necessarily. I got cut off -- I want -- 
>> you could have -- 
>> I'll talk. It's all talk. It's all talk, bro. 
>> It's not all talk. You drove physically. 
>> I never touched her. 
>> You actualldrove here. 
>> Absolutely right. 
>> So you've got a record? 
>> I'm guessing I do. 
>> You're guessing you do? 
>> I have a record. You know it. 
>> You had a problem with a young woman? 
>> A long time ago. 

[00:51:34]


>>> Just hang out for a second, all right? 
>> Yeah. 
>> You bring the camera? 
>> It was like where he had gone through an eco challenge race. He had walked, he had gotten on a bus, he had walked some more, and when you see him come up the driveway, he's got a backpack and a hat, and he looks like a hiker. And he's weary. Thirsty. Hey, sir, could you come back over here, please, a have a seat right -- you seem to be in a hurry there. Have a seat right there, please. 
>> All right. Please sit down. Why were you in such a hurry to get on other side of the fence. 
>> I thought I was looking for somebody. I'm sorr 
>> who were you looking for? 
>> John patterson. 
>> John? Patterson? 
>> Yeah. 
>> And why were you looking for john? 
>> I was going to talk about some business. 
>> And what business was that? 
>> I wanted to try to find a job somewhere, and I heard about john patterson. 
>> And why did you come to this house looking for john patterson? 
>> I had a phone call. 
>> A phone call? 
>> Yeah. 
>> From? 
>> I -- in fact I actually don't know the guy besides the fact that his name was -- I don't remember his name. It was about five hours ago. I've been walking. 
>> So, you were just walking down the road and you thought that this fellow with a construction company lived in this house? 
>> Somebody told me -- 
>> who is somebody? 
>> A young man on the phone. 
>> A young man on the phone. And how did you reach this young man on the phone? 
>> He had called me. 
>> He had called you, just out of the blue? 
>> No, I think he had my number. 
>> He starts to get into this well, I'm here to apply for a job. I said you know the folks who live here? No, but I knew that they were looking for somebody to do some work. And I said, really, what kind of work do you do? Well, you know, driveway work, resurface driveways and cement and stones. And I'm thinking at thisoint, okay, here we go. I'm going to let the line out here and see how far he takes it. And what's your name? 

[00:53:47]


>> My name is michael. 
>> Michael wooltsey? 
>> No, michael wehry. 
>> Michael wehry. You're saying this is somebody else though we're know you're at public library using a computer. 
>> You know I was at a public library. 
>> You don't know everything i know. So you want to tell me the real story now, or you want to go with what you got? It's up to you. 
>> And what is the real story get me? 
>> It's not the first time somebody has tried to take that position. You know, that's an old e-mail account, I don't use it anymore. But when you take him through the math of the situation, okay, this is your screen name, right? Right. This is the communication that we have between somebody using your screen name and a young teen and all of a sudden you're here. You, not someone else, your story doesn't make that much sense. Now maybe I'm skeptical -- 
>> I don't -- 
>> but -- 
>> I don't know who you are. I don't know who you are. I came in here. I was just telling that gate's open, come on in, okay? 
>> It just defied logic. And at some point in the interview, you can see that he knew that this wasn't going to work out to be a great story for him. What this sounds like, michael, is that you were coming here to have sex with a 13-year-old boy. 
>> Hell no. 
>> Why would you say these things to somebody who you thought was a 13-year-old boy. 
>> The comn the library, been using my name. 
>> So, it's one big mix-up? 
>> I'm telling you what I came here. I don't have sex with anybody. Not me. And if you were anybody that had access to my record, you'd look at my record, figure out the only time I had any problems with anybody and a young woman. Unless you looked at my adolescent stuff, and then I was an adolescent. 
>> You've got a record? 

[00:55:49]


>> I'm guessing I do. 
>> You're guess you do? 
>> I have a record. You know it. 
>> You had a problem with a young woman? 
>> A long time ago. 
>> Did you do time for that? 
>> Don't you know? 
>> I'm asking you. 
>> Why are you asking? 
>> I want to know the truth. 
>> Yes, I've done time for that. Straight up. I've done time for that. I was with a young woman. Ain't no kid in me. 
>> We know that he's got a criminal history. And then we have this chat. It's right there in black and white. You're talking to a boy named luke. 
>> I don't know a boy named luke. 
>> I'll be there as close to 11:00 as possible. I will need your number so that I can call you when I'm near the bus stop. I will look for you and we will discretely go to your room and talk and talk about whatever pops up and stimulates you to whatever you want. 
>> You are reading me something that somebody wrote. I'm sorry to hear that. 
>> So I need exact bus stop near our place as I get off. I'll walk toward your street. You also must tell me how to get to your bed from there. 
>> Well, I don't know about what everybody -- that this person has said to a 15-year-old. I never met a 15-year-old. 
>> Well, the reason I'm curious about all of this is that I'm chris hansen with "dateline nbc." And we've been doing a story on computer predators adults who go online to try to meet young teenagers. Now if you have anything else you'd like to say for yourself, we'd love to hear it. If not, you're obviously free to leave and go on your way. 
>> I'm not doing anything. No. There's not a scott patterson. 
>> Do you have scott patterson's name written down? 
>> I have an address. That's all I was going to do. I don't have no phone number, no address. 

[00:57:52]


>> You never wrote down scott patterson's name anywhere? 
>> No. 
>> He maintained until the very end of the interview that he was just a dusty, determined traveler who came from a long ways away to try to get honest work. The problem with that, of course, is that none of it makes sense. When you put it altogether, the chat, his crumbling story and the fact that you know, he's the guy sitting in the kitchen across from me, you know it doesn't look good for him. 
>> The young man I thought was supposed to be here -- 
>> what's that person's name? 
>> Scott was supposed to be here and he didn't mention his name. I said look -- 
>> who is scott? 
>> The guy I was supposed to meet. I was told -- 
>> you work construction? 
>> I was looking for any kind of job. 
>> You don't work right now?

=======================================================

>>> Welcome to "red eye." As I am known by the santa cruz police department, the groper. Andy, what is coming up on tonight's show? 
>> Coming up, gawker publishes a list of licensed gun owners in new york city and I hope criminals don't notice that the author othe piece, john cook, is not on the list. And action figures from "jango unchained" is from civil rights leaders and also al sharpton. And why is president obama nominating nothing but white males to the cabinet positions? The war on women continues straight ahead. Greg? 
>> Thanks, andy. 
>> You disgust me, greg. I was going to tell you why. 
>> Why? 
>> It was only about maybe a month ago you were mocking me mercilessly for wearing a v neck sweater with a collar outside of it. 
>> Really? 
>> Yes. 
>> This is what happens when you leave your stuff at my place. 
>> You are just a little filth bucket. 
>> I am curious, you mentioned john cook. Is that the john cook who lives in prospect heights? 
>> It might be. I'm not sure. Jay in brooklyn -- 
>> in brooklyn? I think so. 
>> We can get his address. 
>> I don't know, maybe so. See you later, jerk. Let's welcome my first guest. I am here are harris falkner, that's her name. And if hilarity were a gift card I would plow him at the olive garden. He is the co-host of the opie and anthony show. And in maine she considered a tackle box. It is bill schulz. And she knows hot stocks like I am -- like I know tube socks. It is true, I am a lonely man who wears tube socks. Sit -- sitting next to me is liz McDonald. Liz is short for elizabeth. And the best juice of his pages is lining bird cages. Our new york times cory spawn department. Gad to see you, pinch. 

[00:02:08]


>> Tyler kapner, the hall of fame voting shutout was a, quote, resounding referendum in baseball. Back then winchester was the one to watch, but he struggled with the screwball which was the best side order of a side ordered spit. At the end of the day, the oklahoma lookilous won and the separate but equals didn't. 
>> I think I got the side order of spit. 
>> I think you did. 
>> Sorry about that, but that's how we talk back then. 
>> It is longer and longer and longer. Eating more and more into the show until we have almost nothing. All right, they want to put a chip in chip. Well, it is true everything is bigger in texas even big brother. A federal judge, is there any other kind, has ruled a san antonio school district can force students to wear locator chips when they are on school property. They were right to expel a sophomore because she refused to wear the device. I think that's her. A spokesman for the district says they are not spying. Rather they are using technology to find students in the building, but not in class when the day begins. The district says they are losing almost $2 million a year due to kids spending time in the halls and stirwells and writing fan fiction about me. Meanwhile at a nearby school for kittens how are lessons on sharing going? 
>> Harris, is this a violation of privacy or privacy? 
>> My understanding of the story is the aclu and a conservative grout called the rutherford institute actually agree. If you are in a school district in north side san antonio, maybe you recognize a problem with that. These are opposing factions that come together on the fact that this is not a good thing. 

[00:04:21]


>> I always go with the mode of thinking that if you have two sides thinking something is wrong then maybe it is wrong. Then I think no maybe that is wrong. That makes three wrongs which makes it right, liz. 
>> Is this an algebra class? 
>> Do you think these #r innocuous tracking devices? And could this turn into a film with tom cruise where he is naked? 
>> If he is naked. I get you on that. It is such a creepy thing. 
>> Really? 
>> To put chips in it just because they want to make sure they get the state education aid they can get? If they don't know where the pupils are and the pupils are not there and they are loitering, they are not going to get the money. 
>> I thought these were chips as in fritos? 
>> You can't put chips in people's pupils. 
>> Anthony, are you a libertarian guy. It is in the school. 
>> It is just in the school. It is nt r -- it is not like they are tracking him around the neighborhood. They have these things called truant officers. This is just a high-tech version of that. I don't see a problem with it. If I had that in my day perhaps I would have graduated high school and had a job my parents would have been proud of. Jay we went -- 
>> we went from truant officers to marks to -- narks to chips. 
>> Did you graduate? 
>> I am a high school dropout. 
>> That's incredible. You may be the only one i know. And you probably make like seven, eight figures? 
>> It is crazy the amount of money I make. 
>> Anthony, you said something interesting. 
>> Well thank you. 
>> You said they will only track the students on campus. Have I two questions. One, how do we know that's true? Who is keeping them honest on that? And where is the database collecting the information on where these kids are? And who is the genius in charge of watching the data when it comes back? 

[00:06:22]


>> And where is the money to buy the chips that the bureaucrats will watch? 
>> This is a show about answers and not questions. 
>> I'm outraged. 
>> My worry is theyill be used to keep tabs on the hot students by the perverted male teachers or perhaps female teachers. 
>> How dare you, greg? I for one am all for teenage boy locators. To a lesser extent girls. I would love to help them with their technology. Give me the database and I can be the eye on the eye on the boys and to a lesser extent girls. 
>> It saves money in the long-term. 
>> How? 
>> You don't need people -- 
>> you lose jobs. 
>> It is like atm's replace banks. We don't see banks anymore, do we? 
>> I don't even know what that is, oldy.What is a bank? 
>> It is the first lawsuit from the parent who says my child was located in this area and something happened to my child in that area. Why didn't you protect my child from that molestation? 
>> I have an alibi. 
>> Who if it is used to thwart an assault. 
>> And we hope that. When you give so much power to an entity and they misuse that power who holds them accountable? 
>> It is better like in star trek and you get beamed up immediatel. 
>> That will happen. 
>> By the way, it won't matter anymore once the war starts and that will be in six months. 
>> The war? 
>> The war on christmas? That's a couple months away. 
>> Whatever the war is. 
>> The war on the fourth of july. 
>> From stalkers to gawkers. Do they prefer perverts over pistols? They posted new york city's licensed gun owns or as the headline called them [bleep]. The tally of gun toters came with the freedom of information act law showing names, but not addresses. And it is more than two years old. Last month a newspaper in west chester kicked up a crap storm after it released pistol holding people. The staff has been getting death threats. This after there was heart felt treaties on whyed it do feel yaw should be viewed as sexual orientation. Elsewhere the gun debate rages on. 

[00:08:53]


>> You know, in the first five years they weren't always arguing like that. She just gets on him and he just wants to be left alone. 
>> The problem is they are staying together for their weird hybrid kids. These dogs with shells, they are so ugly. I say split up. 
>> The thing is luckily the hybrids don't livelong. They can out live the kids and then split up. 
>> Sometimes they do. Sometimes they live with a turtle. 
>> The question is who gets the house? 
>> The other question is when can they be in a freak zoo? 
>> Enough. You are on this list. 
>> I am on the list. 
>> It is somebody who is very private about owning guns. 
>> And they spelled their name right. 
>> Something tells me you are not ticked off about this. 
>> I am very proud about -- 
>> the cameras are rolling. 
>> I talk on my radio show all the time about gun ownership and the second amendment. But it is creepy that they are doing this. There is no reason for it other than some type of weird intimidation or making a villain out of people that own guns. It is almost a pervert sexual predator list kind of thing. 
>> You talk about this on the show. 
>> This is what gets me, liz. Gawker in september did a whole piece explaining how pedophilia could be a sexual orientation. I read the article 17 times. It was like a penthouse letter the way they describe this stuff. And the conclusion is to them a person -- a legal gun owner is more of a threat than a pedophile. 
>> It is pathetic. Did you say the headline had the word "[bleep] in it? 
>> Yes. 
>> When will they put out an interactive map with the pedophile addresses and dead beat dads, mortgage delinquents and unemployment benefit fraud sisters, I have a whole list here. Put that up. 

[00:11:01]


>> There would be outrage. If you posted and somebody tweeted earlier, if you tweeted welfare recipients the same way and put them as public record out there, there would be outrage. 
>> There must be something wrong with me. I didn't find any of this to be neutral. I found this to be serious. I am a former stalking victim and I wrote a book about it. 
>> I apologize for that. 
>> Okay, thanks. I was waiting for that. 
>> Here is my concern. You know, anthony, you have a great attitude about this. You are not the one I am worried about. You are the good guy with the gun. I am worried about your neighbor who doesn't have a gun, and now they know he or she lives next door. Every rapist and robber is going to not bother you. Who is going to protect this person? Didn't they hire security guards after -- so are they going to hire security guards to protect your neighbor? 
>> You know what is hilarious about that story? In the initial story on the guns they smear the cops. They were linking him to corruption and rape. And then in the next blog after the death threats they said, we are contacting the police department. 
>> It was almost like they gave themselves diaper rash writing this story. That's how I felt reading it. They are like a bunch of big babies. They write anonymously. I can't -- that's how they write. 
>> Not all of them write anonymously, but they write with that expression on their face. 
>> And they do all have diaper rash. 
>> There is something going on where gun owners are called nuts. If you are trying to defend the second amendment you are a gun nut. It is not paranoia where my name is on a list along with other people. The president and biden is talking about executive privilege to enact new restrictions on gun ownership. All right, without being paranoid, it is a little scary. 

[00:13:16]


>> When the west chester newspaper did this, did they put the address newspaper on there? No, but they gave the editor and their information out there. I do want to say this. You mention the piece of paper that allows you to get this information. It is public record. It is not like I can't find out that anthony is on this list. It is just crime is opportunity. When you put it on a map and you put a red dot on it and i can click on it and google earth can take me to your freaking house, that's different. 
>> It is like, you know, this is public information. It is available. 
>> It is because they stated that the people who own guns are crazy [bleep]. 
>> Sorry, I didn't mean to yell. 
>> Can I make one point? 
>> People, listen to me. The information is public. But it is not free to see. You have to apply for it. A lot of people want to apply for that information. Say I want to track you down. I won't it. I have to use my information to get that information, to file a freedom of information act. What he did was remove that step. It filed that information and published it. Now the guy that wants to find you can find you. 
>> It is opportunity. 
>> I have to distinguish one fact. They didn't print the addresses. 
>> I don't care. 
>> It gives you the map and it google earths it. What's the difference? 
>> They have workplace addresses for some of them. Bill, you own a firearm, but that's only when you set your arm on fire. 
>> I have very little hair left. 
>> I realize you are the only person who hasn't said a word in this segment. 
>> I heard people are upset they are not on this list and they don't know you have a gun. Apparently you don't need to get a permit for a rifle. So the more you know. 

[00:15:25]


>> You are new york city, by the way. 
>> Well my advice would be to get it illegally. 
>> Well, you know what, a lot of people are taking have advice. Taking that advice. 
>> That is so true. We are driving it underground of is that what we really want? 
>> Thank you. 
>> Good, I'm glad. 
>>> Coming up, half time for bill. I will personally make sure shampoo doesn't get in his eyes. It is like last time. That was cute. What's up with "jango unchained" action figures? And why do I keep accidentally siting on them. Three trips to the er in one week alone. 

[00:19:29]


>>> The dolls from unchained are causing some pain. Some civil rights leaders are angry over the fantasy called "jango unchained." Leonardo dicaprio and the talking german shepherd that can fly. I didn't know he was in it. It has called for a boycott and the director of an l.A. Civil rights organization is calling on the toy company to stop selling these do toys. They say it is a slap in the face of our ancestors. They go on to say, we feel it terrorism lieses the horrors of slavery. I think we have a clip of the film. 
>> Sorry, that was from my perm collection. Ve I a website devoted to that the. I don't know why. The doctor has been telling me to stop. Hair rirks I go to you -- harris, I go to you for no particular reason. What is your take? Are these action figures or are they something more? 
>> Every film gets a cult following. This film is very popular. It has these action figures. Unless these characters have something I don't know. Have they been taken from the past to the future. This is how they market every film. They have done movies like this. If you turn on a new generation to history what is the problem with that? 
>> Is this history. Jay the slavery -- 
>> the slavery topic is real. 
>> Like I was saying saying it wasn't? I stopped bringing those years ago. Liz, there is a huge market apparently for a collectible figure which depresses me for some reason. Should the company have been more sensitive or think about the bottom line? 

[00:21:50]


>> No, al sharpton shut up for once. The guy from the islamic whatever, shut up. Everybody just shut up. They are just trying to make money. I don't care. I am so tired of the feaux fictitious running up to a mic stand. What I want is an action figure of amarosa or bill. I want an action figure of bill. Wh would be his kryptonite? I am not sure. 
>> You use bill and amarosa in the same sentence. They are interchangeable. 
>> I want to see them fighting. 
>> We have similar hair. 
>> I am begging you, please address this topic without saying anything offensive. 
>> All righty, I will give it a whirl. 
>> Somebody look up the word whirl. What does that mean? 
>> Oh my god. In 1880 it meant -- 
>> I don't see any problem with it. The film itself I guess spike lee was giving it slack also. It seems to be empowering. I don't think it is historically accurate. It is a movie but as far as action figures go I would rather have the zed and gimp play set. A lot more fun. Blowtorch and ply yes, sirs sold separately. 
>> I have less of a problem with this than the old anna tom mickly correct barbie and ken. 
>> They were never anatomically correct barbie and ken. 
>> Well ken wasn't, but skipper -- 
>> I remember having a couple where she was like, keep her clothes on. 
>> I had no idea. 
>> I was too busy playing with stretch armstrong. 
>> You will be up on ebay. 
>>> Bill, you know what drives me nuts about this story? I don't care about the movie. It is adult geeks who collect the action figures. The people who collects the action figures are inactive figures they are more extended adolescents. I don't think there is any prior generation that did this. NOBODY IN THE 60s OR THE 50s OR THE 40s OR THE 30s OR 20s OR ZERO'S OR 1890s OR 1880s -- SOMEBODY Tell me to shut up. 

[00:24:10]


>> He is making a poift. 
>> 1850s, 1840s, 1830s -- NO, MY POINT IS HOW Is this a market for kids? 
>> We prefer to call them figurines and that's why we are the greatest generation. 
>> The most offensive thing is the fact that they keep them chained up in the box. Jay it is this whole -- 
>> it is this whole, oh it is out of the box. I'm sorry. You belong in a box. You belong in a box. 
>> Can I just make another point? 
>> I won't say shut up anymore. The islamic guy, didn't the slave trade em -- emonate out of that part of africa and didn't they oversee the slave trade in a big way? I like how he comes in and basically makes his point and runs away. It opens up the conversation for real history. Right? These action figures are actually doing a good thing. 
>> It only happens on intellectual shows or s and salons. I am talking at a leisurely pace and find out whether andy was involved. She should be doing that right now so she can ombuds us. 
>> You notice in the salon i was doing my hair. 
>> If it wasn't full of pawnshop stores. 
>> What channel has intervention on it? 
>> I think that is learning. What am I learning? I am learn thrg is a lot of poop in people's houses. 
>> Have to take a break. We have to take a break. Where there is hoarding there is poop. It was in "field of dreams." If you hoard it, they will poop. If you have a comment just e-mail us. I'm sorry, hair rissments you looked at me disgusted. Yes you did. You shot me a withering look. Do you have a video of your animal doing something, something clean? Click on submit a video. Still to come from andy levy who is googling something right now. 

[00:26:33]


>> Tonight's half time report is brought to you by pickles. Vegetables that acquired a strong taste from being preserved. Thanks, pickle. 

[00:30:24]


>>> We're back. Let's see if we got anything wrong so far. Hi, greg. 
>> Hi, andy. 
>> It is all over your face. 
>> I know why. 
>> Judge rules texas school. Harris, how do we know if they are tracking them on school grounds as they say they r. I believe it is something I like to call trust, harris. When the governmentals me something I believe you should try it sometime. 
>> Does that require a response? They should put something on the screen that says -- i won't even say. 
>> Of course I am kidding about trusting them. The same government that lied to us about landing on the moon would certainly lie about something like this. 
>> You will get there eventually. 
>> You say it is like a truant officer which is maybe true, but more icky? 
>> No, I think everything when it is updated through technology seems icky. But for the most part it is an extension of what we have already had, just a little more convenient and a little more shady. 
>> It protects the kids from the teachers. I'm telling you this is a veiled exercise in saying, oh he is not in mr. Stevens' office. 
>> I don't understand why they are making them wear these. You can lose a badge. You have to implant that sucker. 
>> I agree completely. 
>> Oh my goodness. 
>> Tracking darts. 
>> By the way, shear why the judge ruled against the student, the letter the student's father wrote to the school district said the chip violated his family's religious beliefs. He said, quote, it is our hell fire belief to allow you to track my daughter and it will condemn us to hell. They believe the chip is the mark of the beast. Chapter 13 versus 16 and 17. And I quote, he causes all both small and great, rich and poor and free and slave to receive a mark on their forehead and no one may buy or sell except those who have the mark or the name of the beast or the number of his name. 

[00:32:44]


>> Sounds like the government to me. The name of the beast is dibold. 
>> The school said, okay, you can wear the id card without the chip. Then they were like, no, that's not good enough. The judge basically said look the school district offered you a reasonable accommodation , and you turned it down. 
>> Everyone knows you just take the chip out. You feed it to a dog. And it lets the dog run around the neighborhood. 
>> Put it on a xerox machine or f machine. 
>> I did that and the dog showed up in all of my classes. 
>> And dean's list. 
>> When I got there boy did i screw up. 
>> Look at I now. You wrote "the jwy of hate." 
>> I believe -- greg if i recall correctly barry bonds cheated off that dog. 
>> He did, he did. 
>> Old time "red eye" viewers will get that. 
>> Barry bonds used to cheat off me in high school. 
>> I thought he was older. 
>> He -- you have a big head. 
>> Wow. 
>> His head got bigger. It was from the drugs. 
>> Allegedly. 
>> Allegedly, of course. 
>> Gawker publishes list of new york city gun permit holders. Anthony, you don't mind personally, but there is no reason but creepiness. It is bullying, power and simple. 
>> It is bullying. Whenever you go for the freedom of information act to get something there is a reason or investigation. It is something. This is just purely to intimidate. This exposing of these gun nuts. It is ridiculous. 
>> It is weird shaming them into submission. 
>> This is a big point because the writer had just written a long piece confessing to being a bully in which he tried to urge a girl to commit suicide. 

[00:34:48]


>> This is the same guy? 
>> Same guy. He wrote a think piece because it was so good to confess the past. Turns out he is the same schmuck and the same guy. What a creep. 
>> You asked if it was true if they had the word a-hole in it. The original headline they later changed was here is a list of all of the a-holes in the city. 
>> Greg, you mentioned this information is public information. In fact, cook points out it was available on the web. So great journalism. 
>> Also, greg, you mentioned gawker didn't publish anybody's address. And in fact, cook wined on -- whined on twitter, people are tweeting my address. I didn't publish anybody's address. But he wrote, quote, because the nypd is more interested in raping and or eating ladies and spying on muslims than it is in honoring public records law, the list contains the names and not the addresses of the licensees. Clearly he would have published the list with the addresses, but they wrbt there. 
>> Exactly. 
>> Who put the link in to the map? 
>> Who is this guy? What are his journalistic craw den that wills -- credentials this guy this where did he come from? He is a bully. 
>> He brews sam adams. That's jim cook. 
>> Oh right. 
>> A tremends brewer. 
>> I don't think youeed a journalism background to write for "gawker." 
>> That's a good poimt. 
>> "Jango unchained" action figures causing controversey. None of the characters in this film are real people. So the figures themselves are not based on real figures. 
>> It would be like selling a character from anything else. 
>> Absolutely. 
>> You mentioned spike lee is giving the film itself crap. The project he condemns the figures and he has seen the film twice and thought it was great. He just doesn't like the figures. 

[00:36:52]


>> Good for him. 
>> The fact is if you are selling the figures, what are you selling? 
>> Dolls. 
>> Collectible figuresment. 
>> Figurines. 
>> They are dolls of slaves. You are selling slaves. 
>> The dolls still belong to slaves. 
>> The dolls are kept in the box. 
>> Technically if people are watching us on tv we are trapped in this box, and w are free to roam. 
>> In france mimes are trapped in boxes all the time. What are we talking about? 
>> I don't know. Greg, to your point that you are buying dolls of slaves, they said -- he said look, no action figures of hitler were made for the tarn tino film "inglorious bastards." But they made a figure of the nazi colonel hand. 
>> I didn't know that. 
>> He didn't either. 
>> I stand corrected. I don't know. I find the whole thing unsavory. 
>> Can I sa something? I am not going to see the film and I will tell you why. I saw "ingore gluer yous bastards" and a lot of them liked it. 
>> I loved it. 
>> I don't like fictitious historical revenge fantasies. Because it implies that the people in rlife didn't do it. They didn't have the wherewith all and the guts to follow through. Quinten tarantino accomplished it. But they didn't do it back in the day. There is something unsavory about creating heroic fiction. I don't like it. 
>> I don't think you like the jews killed the gnaw swreas. 
>> You are a terrible person. 
>> I actually loved that girl in "inglorio bastards." 
>> Did you like brad pitt's accent? 
>> Everybody in that movie was good, but I had a tough time. I am watching it saying what is this saying? What is it saying about the people who lived at that time? 

[00:38:59]


>> You should just watch a movie and be entertained. 
>> I completely agree. 
>> My favorite movie of all time is "blue velvet." 
>> That explains a lot. 
>> That's a creepy movie. 
>> I love that movie. We should go and watch it together some time. 
>> I president can't. I can't. 
>> Why? 
>> Okay. 
>> The assorted case of 10 action figures from "jango unchained" is selling for 595 on amazon. Jay that's the poit. 
>> For real? 
>> One merchant is offering the carrie washington character. 
>> You know what is dreefg up the value? 999. 
>> You are kidding nearly a grand? Jay it has gone down? 
>> Two separate things. You can buy the whole thing for 595 or the whole thing for almost a thousand bucks. 
>> What about the one with amarosa. 
>> Why it is amarosa. Believe it is amarosa. 
>> Let's call the whole thing off. This is the most times her name has been mentioned in the past 10 years. 
>> Lastly there was an islamic slave trade. 
>> There was? He validated -- thank you, andy wherever he went. He is walking down the hall looking for a candy bar. 
>> He is trying to get on the phone to buy one of the action figures. 
>>> Coming what is love? Baby don't hurt me, hurt me no more. A strange message that was sent to me. Why does the president loathe women? A fair and balanced look at this kenyan bornnnnnnn 

[00:44:03]


>>> women helped him prevail, and yet he favored white and male. President obama, if that's his real name, has nominated a bunch of men to serve in top national security positions including head of the cia, secretary of state and secretary of defense. And not helping matters he picked women to be secretary of vacuuming and secretary of doing the dishes. 
>> What? 
>> The washington post said supporters are irked by the shortage of ladies in prominent jobs especially after making women's issues a big part of his campaign. Look at him smile mocking them. To me it is massage nighs to put women in cabinet. That's just me. Discuss, shall we? 
>> Lightning rooooouuuunnndd. Lightning round. 
>> On a scale of one to impeachment, how much do you care if he doesn't choose any women? 
>> I look at the track record. You have desiree rogers who was employed by the president. She was the social sectd. 
>> That was a guy? 
>> She was a woman. Then have you susan rice and the whole benghazi thing. Then you have secretary of state hillarynton which both sides of the political aisle have been pleased with her job, but then there was the benghazi thing. 
>> So you are saying he has done his women's business and now he is on to men? That makes me sick. 
>> Okay. I am just giving you an example. You are the queen of examples. Liz, are you surprised how much they chased the female vote and now he talked on the side like something you would toss aside perhaps a package of delicious goods? 
>> I was kind of surprised. 
>> Moving right along, listen, I'm all for women getting the powers they deserve. 

[00:46:03]


>> Boo! Boo! 
>> But I want them to get it on their own merits and because of their ideas and not for being women. 
>> This is what happens when you stop talking about americans and start dividing it up by orientation gender and skin color. It bites back, the party is thinking it is kind of in a way hurting from it. 
>> Do you agree with everything I just said? 
>> Every word of it, greg. As far as his promise for a diverse cabinet and whatnot it is promise 456. I broke my promises list. 
>> I think that is the arency. 
>> It makes you wonder does he care? Or does he need to get the job done without distraction. I don't say it too lightly. There are two women not getting a lot of attention. 
>> He is going into the default position. Just get me an old white guy. They fade into the background and no one notices them. They are too feeble to get anything done. I find that disgusting. You once lived in a cabinet. 
>> Ikea. Hard to put together. 
>> As are you. Jay obama didn't say -- one of his campaign promises were -- I was like, equal pay for women. 
>> He never said I promise to only hire women. I don't think that was in the bargain. He hired the best people for the job. I don't see what the big deal is. 
>> He said he was going appoint more women to positions of status. 
>> Okay, but on a personal don't think women should be be able to drive. 
>> I was so glad you mentioned that perm note. 
>> I just think it is too much. You have a lot of damn things so get off the road. Leave it to the men. 
>> Sorry. I am torturing bill. 
>> We are going to take a break right now, but there is more stuff on the way. We will talk about the fun stuff. We will get to a story we president haven't got to in four days. 

[00:48:09]


>> Really? 
>> Yes, we are. 

[00:52:13]


>>> Last topic, a new study says people who feel lower in status compensate by buying expensive crap. A researcher at ohio state, go pitt sniffers, have a lesser statute chiewr -- stature for italian suits and homemade beef jerkey. And they say it is true regardless of race. Meanwhile in a totally unrelated story this indian dude spent $22,000 on a shirt made of gold to impress the ladies. Said the dapper fell law, i know I am not the best looking man in the world, but truly no woman could fail to be dazzled by this shirt. Why does he have to say men or man? 
>> I don't know if he is a homophobe in that shirt. 
>> She a handsome guy. He didn't need that gold shirt. 
>> He could be shirtless. 
>> Do you buy this here re? 
>> How did they get the money to buy the stuff? 
>> I think status always means finances which means he is spending his money. 
>> I didn't pay my represent because I wanted slot cars. 
>> He thought slot cars are bring. 
>> To me that was something cool. 
>> When you see a potential suiter list and you say that one has bling and it is a slot car does bling actually work? 
>> Am I going to sound stupid by asking what a slot car? 
>> They are racers and they go around and they are in a slot. 
>> Maybe if you were not in the doll section of toys r us. 
>> Action figure section, sir! 
>> I didn't know what they were either. 
>> You didn't know what slot cars were? 
>> No. 
>> The worst thing is you would get them for christmas and they ever would never work. 

[00:54:15]


>> They had a slot in the track and they would whip around. Ou owned an animal the hair would get in the slot and the car would stop and you would cry. 
>> Slot cars always ended in tears. One way or another. You got hit hit by one or it didn't work. I don't remember what the story was about. 
>> Slot cars. 
>> Any thoughts in -- any thoughts? 
>> This is the pimp's way, isn't it? That's why pimps dress up, i guess. So they fail like they made it. I honestly don't think this is something to spend research money on. I want your salary. 
>> You can have it after the show. 
>> You have a cheap knockoff version of that guy's shirt. It only tboas to your belly. 
>> That's more to protect me from the government. 
>> She was telling me before the show she wants to be a kardashian for a minute. 
>> No, I don't like that family. They are hideous. 
>> Can you just tell them to shut up? 
>> You don't mince words. 
>> I am kind of cranky tonight. 
>> I like it when you are cranky. 
>>> We will close things out with a post game wrap up with tv's andy levy. Go to fox news.Com/red eye. Just look for me. 

[00:59:00]


>>> Andy levy post game wrap up. 
>> Thanks, greg. What is imack's bottom line? 
>> It is a column we write. We break some news for once and that is about aig suing over the government's rescue. 
>> They seem like lovely people. 
>> They are charming. 
>> Harris, where is a good place for people who want to ask questions and get some answers. 
>> Twitter because I love to tweet. 
>> Excellent. 
>> I'm fine. 
>> No, bill, are you not. 
>> Anthony x how is the old radio show going? 
>> The opie and anthony show, 6:00 to 10:00. Get up early, complain about getting up early and then go home and bask in m wealth. 
>> You are so good at basking. You really are. You live the life. 
>> Thank you. 
>> You live the life every man

=======================================================

In the world is also in china. It is shanghai. London and new york come third and fourth respectively. Thanks to all of you for being part of my program this week. I will see you next week. Stay tuned for "reliable sources." 
>>> There were plenty of predictions after the tragedy of newtown that the media would lose interest, that the subject of guns would quickly fade. That hasn't happened. When joe biden weighing in this week and some television commentators pushing the issue. Such as when cnn piers morgan invited a controversial talk show host who wants him deported for his views on gun control. 1776 will commence, again, if you try to take our firearms! 
>> Alex, I get accused when i get you guys on of talking over you and trying to be rude. I'm trying to be civil. 
>> Are the media conducting a serious debate or an incendiary one? 
>>> Lance armstrong after a decade of denial is heading to oprah's couch to confess to doping. But does she still have the cultural clout to save him? 
>>> In other sports news, brent musburger spending too much time did the network need to apologize? 
>>> Plus, jimmy kimmel plunging into the late night wars against leno and letrman. 
>> Used to be on at midnight and now we're on at 11:35. Now closer to co-hosting "the view." I'm howard kurtz and this is "reliable sources." 
>>> The television cameras were invited to the office building as vice president biden held his first meetings on the gun issue. 
>> Every once in a while, something that awakens the conscious of the country and that tragic event did in a way like nothing I've seen in my career. 

[00:02:05]


>> But a few words uttered by the vp that the president might consider changing some policies by executive order sparked an explosion in the conservative media. 
>> What you're experiencing here is an out of control, an arrogant, an unconstitutional power grip. 
>> Embarked on a ferocious anti-gun campaign. You better support gun control or else. 
>> The nra has created this mystique about themselves. They expect us to be enthralled by that mystique. The beltway press is enthralled by that mystique. 
>> Injecting poison into the conversation as I see it on gun reform. 
>> Joining us now to examine the media's coverage of this volatile issue. Paul farhi. Robert costa, washington editor at "national review." In new york keli goff political correspondent for theroot.Com. Is the cover of this issue, joe biden's meetings this week, is it fair or a bias towards some government action? 
>> There's probably not enough coverage of the biden working group and what's happening on capitol hill. The conversation seems to be dominated by the talking heads on the cable news networks about what their antics are in that tly program. More coverage of the political process. I believe that. 
>> You believe the substance is being overshadowed by the political shouting, so to speak. 
>> The public expects real objective it etaand expects reporting and what they're getting is a spectacle on television that is called dialogue. 
>> Keli goff, what do you think about that? 
>> I think that's somewhat true, but not surprising. When I write articles about the fiscal cliff debate and the ins and outs and what's being cut and those don't get as many clicks as who is being mean to the president or who the president is being tough talking to. Right? So, a lot of americans follow media coverage about the shenanigans, the inner workings and the purse nals and don't want to hear thty-gritty about the details. Does it mean we don't have a responsibility to discuss those details? Absolutely we do. I'm being forth right on what goes on. It's not surprising that people are following the fight more than the details of what could happen with the legislation. 

[00:04:21]


>> That is the core issue. What our responsibility is to not only cover this issue, but maybe push it. After every other mass shooting. We lived through a lot of them of them in the past couple of decades. The gun issue flares up. This time seems to be very different. Why? 
>> You had a very emotional issue. 20 school children, if that doesn't get anybody's attention, nothing will. We're not pushing an agenda, we're covering the news. The president has raised this issue, I should say with a lot of support from the public and we are going with the newsmakers have led us. 
>> What are not doing enough on the substance of the debate and what the biden group is pursuing. We don't know what the administration proposed, but we should find out within days. Do you think there is a deficit of coverage there? 
>> No, I think there is a surfeit of coverage. There is, it has been on the front page every single day that this working group has been around. It's on television all the time. There's no bigger issue in america right now. 
>> I disagree respectfully because when you look at what's getting attention. David gregory bringing an empty clip on "meet the press." Alex jones on to cnn and newspapers publishing the addresses of gun owners in the front page. So, that's what's getting attention. I read "the post" and read those stories and they're all around in the press, but ne'er not getting attention because it's the circus on the television. 
>> Those stories are part of the larger story. 
>> True. 
>> They should be the larger story. 
>> It raises the attention of the larger issue, as well. 
>> We're going to come back to some of those very incidents that you mentioned, robert. Let me come back to keli on this issue. Went basically hay wire over vice president biden saying the possibility of executive orders. As if this meant that the government would send out agents to start confiscating guns. 
>> Right. Well, to be clear, I think we all know that sean hannity goes crazy when there's something mentioned in terms of executive orders. 

[00:06:26]


>> He wasn't the only one. Every conservative website raised the specter of averting the constitution when in reality if you look at it, relatively little this president or any president can do. The big ticket items and closing loopholes at gun shows and background checks, assault weapons, reinstating assault weapon ban. The executive order thing just kind of exploded. 
>> I would also say this is specific to this president. Not only very little he can do in terms of executive order but very little he can do on gun control. What's faceinating the moment he got elected, gun sales have gone through the roof. Gone through the roof when there has been a shooting. I'm making the point that there is something specific to this president that we discussed on your show that is just not specific to this issue, but a larger story here in terms of the phobia they have about him because in terms of gun control and his record hasn't done enough to warrant some of this out of the box fear that is over the top. 
>> Barack obama did virtually nothing about gun control in his first term. To be fair, neither did the press. I want to come back to because it has gotten so much attention when piers morgan had on his cnn program alex jones, who is a conservative talk show host and a gun rights activist and a rather high decibeled a gulf coast for his position. Let's take a look at how that went down. 
>> Stalin took the guns and fidel castro took the guns, hugo chavez took the guns and I'm here to tell yo6 will commence, again, if you try to take our firearms? Come to america, I'll take you out shooting and you can join the republic! 
>> You finished? 
>> Yes, I am finished. You will not take my right. 
>> How many gun murders in britain? 
>> How many great white sharks kill people every year but they're scared to swim. 
>> I guess he wasn't finished. How did piers morgan handle alex jones? 

[00:08:27]


>> Did anyone at cnn or piers morgan show ever see or hear alex jones before they booked him on that show. 
>> He let him have his say and alex jones his views were on display. 
>> Piers morgan thought he was going to have an ox ford debating style debate about gun control. 
>> You think so? 
>> He kept saying it on the air, matter of fact. Alex jones doesn't play by those rules and they should have known that going into it. Alex jones is a monologist. He will go on and on and on. 
>> What piers morgan said he said that you expose the ridiculousness in his view, he's an advocate on this issue of gun control. Alex jones by putting them on the air, letting them rant and rave and he said this has been aviewed 5 million times on youtube and has certainly gotten a lot of attention. 
>> It is great for alex jones. I'm sure his ratings on his radio show will go up tremendously because of it. 
>> Can I disagree a little bit? Examining this as a contest of who got to say more words, then, yes, al jones won. If you examine this as who came across looking more sane? Than piers morgan won. I have to say I heard from a lot of piers morgan said who say, I'm mad at alex jones because he made me defend and have to like and cheer for piers morgan for once. One of the best per children and I can think of gun owners that are not proud this is the voice representing them. On that regard, I think it was effective because a lot of sane people say the gun control can go too far and they hear someone like this talking about 1776 rebellion. That's not what I want to be associated with. 
>> Let me get robert in, keli. 
>> They shape policy. 
>> I think the entire decision from the editorial perspective to bring alex jones a known 9/11 conspiracyeirrist who thinks the government is working against people to put him on primetime and portray him as and I think alex jones ranting and raving, that's entertainment. If the press wants serious journalism, they shouldn't bring alex jones. 

[00:10:45]


>> I don't think he's fair to say that cnn presented al jones as the face -- 
>> why give him the air time? 
>> The guy has the following, right? You're saying he shouldn't be allowed on the air. 
>> If you're trying to have an ox oxford style debate. 
>> It's television. 
>> Except that alex jones was representing the nra's position except just a greater volume. 
>> Argue that alex jones does not represent their position. 
>> Their rhetoric is very -- 
>> just briefly, keli. 
>> This is the rush limbaugh debate. When someone has 2 million listeners, you can't dismiss them. If they want to reach an +dience, they're not ashamed to have alex jones have a link out to their site and say he doesn't represent us. 
>> Just gives alex jones unnecessary credibility and he does not represent the main stream perspective. 
>> I think he represents the nra's perspective on the debate and, in fact, many gun advocates who would say right on to him. 
>> I think a lot of the gun advocates don't have the hysteria that jones has -- 
>> you're talking about style, you're not talking about substance. 
>> Alex jones's message has a lot of questionable aspects to it and does not represent the conservative way of thought. 
>> Let me move on by saying other voices in the media speaking out for debate about what to do about guns. Jon stewart did something that was not necessarily funny but from the heart. And david gregory, you mentioned earltually led the program a couple weeks ago when I'm sure we have a picture of it to show you, he was interviewing the ceo of the national life association waved that high-capacity magazine clip. D.C. Authorities saying he will not be prosecuted and nbc saying this was done solely for journalistic purposes. 

[00:12:49]


>> It was a prop that became the story. Something that shouldn't be the story. The media wants to cover this debate, yet always seem to become the story, especially when they're covering these heated issues. 
>> That gave the pro-gun crowd an opportunity to beat up on the media, which is also part of the strajgy of the nra to demonize the media. This was a perfect opportunity for them. 
>> Do you see -- go ahead, briefly, keli. 
>> This is what the president said in the "meet the press" interview a week ago, without it is very little you can get done in this town. What this whole conversation is whether we cover these big personalities and make them too much part of the larger stories. That's how we get readers and viewers to pay attention to the policy debate. 
>> I had an avalanche amount of people that journalists are not above the wall, gregory should be persecuted and d.C. Authorities say exercising his first amendment rights. Not one that should result in him being behind bars. Thanks very much for stopping in this morning. 
>>> When w come back, lance armstrong ready to seek forgiveness with oprah winfrey. Does she still have that kind of clout? Should espn apologize for musburger gushing over a player's girlfriend? Right in the old bucket. Good toss! See that's much better! That was good. You had your shoulder pointed, you kept your eyes on your target. Let's do it again -- watch me. Just like that one...

[00:17:29]


>>> Lance armstrong has insisted again and again to many journalists, including me and to the public that he won all those cycling titles without taking performance enhancing substances. 
>> Listen, I have said it for seven years, I said it for longer than seven years. I have never doped. That's crazy. I would never dothat. That's -- no, no way. 
>> But now those denials are coming to an end with armstrong planning a visit to oprah's couch. He will be interviewed on oprah's cable show this coming week. What could that mean for his career and hers? Joining us christine brennan. Welcome. 
>> Thank you. 
>> Could even an oprah moment help revive lance armstrong's career. 
>> This is a lose/lose. Whatever he has to say, it's way too late. This is a man who has fought too long for, as those clips showed, he has never done anything. Now he is going to do a 180 and admit it all. 
>> But the idea is that you seek forgiveness. You go to the church of oprah and maybe you cry a little bit and america feels sorry for you. 
>> Bernie madoff, if he had shown up three months after the fact. 
>> That is some company you're putting armstrong in. 
>> He is in that league. 
>> I was a national hero, cancer survivor, but let's be clear. He did this to himself. 
>> This is all self-induced. And he is, I think we can safely say, the biggest fraud, the worst fraud in the history of sports. 
>> All sports? 
>> Oh, I absolutely think so. He transcended sports. Not just as an athlete. But he moved into that world of our culture with cancer. So, I think things are different. I think the reality is the old days of crying on oprah's couch and coming clean, first of all, I think the american public is smarter than that. This notion that he is going to be able to compete. Come back and compete, again. By the way, come back to what? He is retired from cycling. It's triathlons and marathons. It's driving him crazy that he couldn't do this. Should have thought of that years ago. This notion he is able to compete, even if he gives up all the goods. All the doctors, names, everything he could possibly think of only reduce his lifetime ban, potentially reduce it to eight years which would take him almost to his 50th birthday. 

[00:19:54]


>> Let's talk aboutprah winfrey. We remember the 25 years when she was a superstar. The queen of talk. Millions of viewers and now has the struggling cable channel. The oprah winfrey channel which gives fewer than 50,000 viewers on average. Even if this visit in television terms would be a big success, not that many people are going to see it. 
>> I have no idea what channel the oprah winfrey network is. 
>> I had to look it up. 
>> I'll have to look it up thursday night to watch it. I think that's part of the problem. I understand why she wants it. 
>> Why does she want it? 
>> This is great publicity. 
>> It puts her back in the limelight. 
>> This is supposed to happen in lance's home in austin, texas. She will have a week of really good publicity for her. You know, this notion that she's taking questions, asking people what they would ask lance, not that it matters because I can't imagine she's going to come clean and say what he needs to say. It would require a mini series not 90 minutes on oprah. 
>> His charity is hurting, live strong. First a leak to "the new york times" saying he is considering doing something like this and going on oprah and then he is going to confess to some degree. I guess people in his camp or armstrong himself who, by the way, was veciferous with me. He attacked the people of the u.S. Anti-doping investigators who were investigating him saying that they were conducting a peendetta. He is a pretty good liar. Legality aside, he could get a second chance in the court of public opinion by doing the oprah thing. 
>> Maybe he could. I hear from those people a lot who say he never failed a drug test. That will take care of them. He will lose that last group of people who say he never failed a drug test. He would admit that. Some would dab their eyes and we understand, everyone was cheating in the sport, but it opens the legal mine fields for there is already three lawsuits out there and I can't imagine friday morning, everybody saying if he admitted I'm going after him. Then, no matter what he says, this has been missing in the news, we have done it with "usa today" constantly. Even if he comes completely clean all the documents, howie, all the layers and layers and hours and hours of giving up the goods, he still would only have the potential to lower that ban to eight years. 

[00:22:30]


>> You reported in your newspaper that he had met early on with the head of the u.S. Anti-doping agency to try to see whether or not he could make some kind of comeback and make a contribution and that sort of thing. These are kind of acts of desperation. To drive home the point of how cheating and the use of banned substances or taking illegal drugs can taint athletes, you look at what happened this week "new york times" had a blank page who had been admitted to the baseball hall of fame. Roger clemens, sammy sosa, barry bonds. All of whose careers have been tainted by drugs. Hard to come back from this, even if oprah wraps her arms around you. 
>> This is a guy who is more adamant than anyone else that he didn't cheat. He had this opportunity in june. The u.S. Anti-doping agency said, come clean and you can be part of the solution and maybe then they would have decreased the lifetime ban. You know, but he refused to do that. So, he had that opportunity in june. So why he's doing it in january, I think, as I said earlier, the american public is smarter than this. This is so transparent. This guy is not sorry that he doped. He is sorry that he got caught. 
>>> Let me turn to one other controversy in the world of sports and that was during the college football championship game. Veteran broadcaster brent musberger of espn. Perhaps you've seen this online was going on and on about the girlfriend of the quarterback a.J. Who happened to be in the stands. 
>> Miss alabama and that's a.J. McCARRON'S GIRLFRIEND. What a beautiful woman. 
>> Catherine is her name. Little carried away? 
>> Yes, a little carried away. He apologized and became a huge deal for several days. 
>> Why it was such a huge deal? 
>> Mostly because the game was so lousy. That game was a blowout by that time. 

[00:24:33]


>> Alabama is winning by 80 touchdowns. Nothing else to talk about. 
>> Late in the second quarter. So, yeah, I wish we would focus more on women who are participating on the field of play than women on the sidelines. But maybe coming back and talking to you in 30 years on that subject. 
>> She is, what, former miss alabama. Didn't exactly insult her. 
>> Brent's a friend and i respect brent. He has been great. Amazing career. What he should have said and i think he would agree is say THERE IS A.J. McCARRON'S MOTHER, His girlfriend, miss alabama. And leave it at that. Look his whole family is there. 
>> Lve it at that. He was excited. All right, so, in my view goes on "today" show and says what was your reaction to all this? Let's take a look. 
>> I think the media has been really unfair to him. I think that if he would have said something along the line that we were hot or sexy or any derogatory statements like that, that would have been a little bit different. 
>> So, with katherine webb saying that, does espn need to apologize? 
>> No. I think it was much to do about nothing. Brent musberger made a mistake. Worth an apology? I don't think so. If the game had been good, had been close, no one would have paid attention to this. As I said, if you're an announcer, focus on the facts and go back to the game and that's what brent musberger should have done. 
>> So I shouldn't say, christine brennan, you're looking fine. 
>> I would take the compliment. 
>>> Jimmy kimmel going head-to-head with leno. 

[00:29:26]


>>> It's not very common for a network to oust a program that is winning its time slot but abc did just that to "nightline" pushing it back one hour in favor of jimmy kimmel. 
>> Starting tomorrow evening, "nightline" is moving to 12:35 eastern. Don't you worry, all the great stories you've enjoyed and we've loved bringing to you over the past 33 years will be just one hour later. 
>> For the first time, there's a three- way comedy faceoff at 11:30 with kimmel taking on letterman and leno. 
>> For those of you who tune in expecting toee "nightline" right now, this is not it. "Nightline" is on after us and it is a great show. For instance, did you know honey booboo's mother is afraid of mayonnaise? 
>> What does this mean for late night and "nightline" joining me is gale shister and in new york adbuckman media reporter for tv howl and welcome to you, adam buckman. Does america really need another comedian at 11:30? 
>> That remain fooz be seen. Jimmy kimmel got millions of viewers and beat david letterman out on tuesday. Are they interested in watching a late-night show and it turns out that they are interested in having a third choice with jimmy kimmel. 
>> Right. Obviously, more attention when you make your debut, gale shister. Given leno and letterman have well-established franchises. How does kimmel distinguish himself? 
>> I think he distinguishes himself by lowering the median age of viewers at 11:35 p.M. Right away. I think he attracts a much younger audience. 
>> Lowering from 85 to something more reasonable? 85 to at least 83. But, also, if anything happens, I think he may hasten the retirement of letterman. I think that what may happen is if letterman continues to get beaten by kimmel and there's more erosion in his audience, it may end up pushing him off the air. 

[00:31:39]


>> Interesting publicity build up here, first, let me play jay leno taking, having a little bit of fun with the situation on "tonight show." 
>> Well, here, maybe it's me. Take a look. 
>> Late night comedy talk show wars are suddenly becoming a crowded time slot. 
>> Hold it right there. Now, wait a minute. I have been here 20 years, is that the best picture they have of me? 
>> But what really struck me was the way in which jimmy kimmel, you know, doing interviews in places like "rolling stone." I looked at my papers and i found the quote kimmel says, "you can't be a comedian and not have disdain for leno. He was a master chef who opened a burger king." So adam buckman, is jimmy trying to get a little attention for himself for his big network debut? 
>> I think he is. I think he's wrong. Probably plenty of comedians that would give their right arm, if not both arms to be in jay leno's position of pulling down the incredible money he makes and fame and recognition that he has. That's why most of them got into the business to be jay leno aspire to be a person in his position. 
>> It seemed to me, il, what kimmel was trying to do. Remember how captivated we were of the conan/o'brien which got everybody talking about late night and that could only help him as the new guy, not the new guy on the block. He had a network for some years but moving up to that prime 11:30 slot. 
>> If I'm a pr person, it makes perfect sense. But he's creating buzz by going after the king. Leno is the king. It is well known that kimmel idleizes letterman. If you're going to shoot for somebody, why not go after the number one funny guy in late night. It's creating a little buzz, but, also, I like kimmel's act. I didn't watch him that much when he was on later. I watched him the past week and I was very impressed. 

[00:33:43]


>> You were sleeping. You were very impressed. 
>> I'm an old person. 
>> Think he's a young, fresh face that could be seriously competitive for abc in this time slot. Remember, what was i2002 when abc caused an uproar to make plans to lure letterman to abc and replace ted koppel. Not as much ankest even in the news business of "nightline" being pushed back to the middle of the night. Why do you think that is? 
>> I would say it was a different universe back then. It was a different tv universe. Not quite as technologically advance. The universe wasn't as balkanized as it is now. Anybody who wants to see "nightline" and doesn't want to stay up that late to watch it can watch it on their computers the next day. It wasn't the same thing ten years ago. So, I think, also, there's a lot more choices. And if you don't want to watch "nightline" and you want to watch another news show, there will be one somewhere. It's a different show, too. Don't forget. In 2002, it was koppel. 
>> Exactly. 
>> You don't have the stature. 
>> I have to give credit to cynthia McFadden and it's tough to put on a news show at 11:35 and beat the two biggest comedians and "nightline" was able to do that, but the program didn't make itself indispensable because more of a variety show where they would do light and more serious topics. 
>> Very much so. 
>> And the reason abc musked it out of the time period was abc is seeking some sort of parody from 11:35 with a one-hour comedy show to control a lot more variety of advertisers and sponsors than a news program that only lasts a half an hour. Just so much commercial time in a 25-minute show, which is what "nightline" had been reduced to and just so many advertisements that want to be with a serious news program. The door just flies open for sponsorships when you put a comedy show on at 11:35. 

[00:36:01]


>> You're giving me the business explanation. But already in the four nights this has happened the audience for "nightline" has been reduced from 4 million to just under 2 million on average. I mean, that is a big blow. 
>> But you don't know how many -- 
>> no, you go ahead. 
>> I was just going to say, you don't know how many of those 2 million are awake. 
>> And, so, you know, i understand it's a competitive world and as adam just said, comedy rates better and advertisers maybe more want to be associated with it than a show that is maybe leading with the latest terror attack or fiscal cliff battle in washington. But, still, a 33-year-old franchise started famously as american held hostage by koppel back in 1980. Part of me that is sad about this, but I don't sense any great discomfort about this, at least in the press. 
>> The television viewing public is getting plenty of news and they don't really need "nightline" any more at 11:35 and I don't think "nightline's" coverage has been indispensable to the public consumption of news and their understanding of big stories. I just think that, you know, look, television shows don't have tenure. Television is not a university and after 33 years, maybe that's the biggest reason to move nightline out of the time period and also evolve it towards this week night franchise. They are talking about doing primetime "nightline" specials and this is where network news divisions make their money. Like "primetime" "20/20" and maybe "nightline" can make money in that way.

>>> Joe scarborough and meeka bruginika brzezinski are good friends. Mika pushed back against joe's argument and things heated up from there. 
>> I am afraid to use the word because it will not be good for you. Okay. Because you're being chauvinistic right now and you need to stop. 
>> Am I really? 
>> I'm sorry. This is not funny. 
>> No, it's not funny. You're calling the wrong guy a chauvinist. Seriously, hold on -- you want to call me a chauvinist. Right here. 
>> Stop, let me help you. 
>> No, let me help you. Do you really knowing me and seeing me work around here for five years you want to call me a chauvinist on television? 
>> Gail shister was that riveting television or hard to watch? 
>> I don't know about you, but my thighs are quivering. This drives me crazy. Joe scarborough talks when he inhales. I have never seen anybody this side of chris matthews who interrupts as much as he does and mika sit there since the beginning like a school girl and makes faces and doesn't fight back. When she says I have a word for you and you're not going to like it I thought, oh, boy, mika has grown a pair. She is going to stand up to this verbal bully and finish a complete sentence and when she says chauvinist. You would have thought she was calling the guy a -- that that was the best she could come up with. 

[00:42:53]


>> It's a strong thing to say. 
>> The whole thing was disappointing. 
>> It is called "morning joe." He is the star of the show. These people who work so closely together. They both seem really mad. 
>> I find it entertaining not that I wish anybody to have a poor day at the office. But it made for riveting television and, as a result, we're talking about "morning joe" today and we don't talk about it that often. To me they came across as two co-workers who work closely with each other every day at the office and as we do with co-workers we like, we sometimes have a bad day with them. I think that is what it was like. It was very relatable. The male/female give and take and what I said about two co-workers having a bad day together where they didn't speak for the rest of the day. That is reable to most people. 
>> Howie, I totally disagree. I think that she was so restrained. I wanted to jump through the screen and just choke her and say, man up, mika. If that's her being really, really angry. She's supposed to be a little more, she's supposed to raise the decibel level a little bit the way he does and show her anger instead of discussing her anger and repressing it. In some ways, very gender like. That's the way girls express anger. 
>> Strangling is against the law, even on television. After a break mika brzezinski came back and said she was using it as an adjective and they seem to have made up. 
>> Oh, please. 
>> Thank you very much.

>>> The tale of the late bbc entertainer jimmy savile gets more sickening. The report by british authorities say savile abused more than 200 children, some of them as young as 8. In 23 cases the assaults took place at bbc television center the last one during a taping a half dozen years ago when savile was nearly 80. A guardian columnist said he was truly an evil genius and the independent calls him a monster who was hiding in plain site. The police and other institutions fell short but the greatest shame belongs to the bbc which killed an investigation after savile died leaving his crimes to be discovered by itv.

[00:49:11]


>>> The chinese newspaper called "southern weekend" calling for greater constitutional freedoms. Decimated the editorial and then things took an unusual turn. Street protests outside the paper and some journalists went on strike, this in a country where authorities can shut down not just any publication, but punish individual oggers. Joining us now, rebecca mackinnon and former beijing bureau chief for cnn. Thank you for coming in. 
>> Thank you. 
>> China is long accustomed to censorship. Why were there street protests and journalists actually going on strike? 
>> Well, there have been strikes before. In 2006 there was a strike at another public over the firing of an editor. 
>> Isn't it risky to do that. 
>> It is risky, but usually in the past this was not known, thanks to censorship beyond a very small circle of people. What changed is social media. That the journalists that were going on strike that were angry about having been censored in this case this past week, were on what is called wabl, a chinese version of twitter with lots of followers and are sort of media celeb bri ts, complained about being censored. Celebrities that followed them retweeted it and millions of chinese knew about this. 
>> Whereas in the past people wouldn't known have about it. 
>> So people sympathetic came to support them from around the country. 
>> Since you mentioned social media it's fascinating, china has this vast propaganda apparatus, goes after bloggers, after people posting on twitter, some with substantial followings like you say, how many people the government assigns to this censor every post, every text message? It seems like a daunting task? 
>> That's right. They actually can't censor everything. They do targeted censorship. 
>> To make an example of people. 

[00:51:11]


>> In order to go after particular threats that they think could result in national movements against the central government. They actually allow quite a lot of those reporting and tweeting about local issues, local corruption and so on and that enables people to blow off steam. 
>> That's okay because it fits the government's agenda and don't challenge the authority of the party? 
>> The government could come in and fix the problem it makes them look good. 
>> There was a compromise in this case involving where the paper was allowed to keep publishing but in the next issue didn't address the controversy everybody was talking about. Much of a compromise? 
>> It was something of a compromise. This newspaper has always been under censorship and always pushing against the controls and I know a lot of people have been fired from the paper over the past several decades. 
>> People you've met personally. 
>> Yeah. 
>> This is gaung. 
>> And people I've known when i was in hong kong. The compromise is not about stopping censorship, it's about going back to a status quo that existed a year ago before the government started increasing censorship. It's always been the government gives instruction to the editor saying you're not going to cover this, cover x in y way, giving detailed examples about how they have to cover things. And then if they misjudge their instructions then they get in trouble. That was the old ystem. Over the past year, the government has been interfering much more directly prepublication, changing things. And this last example of the kew year's editorial was the last straw for a lot of journalists. So it's really the negotiation is about going back to the old censorship system. 
>> Which is still -- 
>> rather than the new and extreme censorship system. 
>> Even the old system to the westerners sounds totalitarian, and am necessity international says china has the largest number of jailed journalists. People who challenge this if you're in the business or decide to join the street protest you do this at some risk? 
>> That's absolutely true. There are jurpists from this paper that have gone to jail for some of the reporting they tried to do. 

[00:53:18]


>> Why is the government so obsessed with keeping such a tight reign on what is published? It's not like any of these publications or bloggers is calling for the overthrow of the state? 
>> Well, they' worried if they give more room, that some people calling for the overthrow of the state or for multiparty system might emerge. 
>> It's a slippery slope they're walking. 
>> They're worried about the slippery slope. 
>> Does it seem to you based on your experience that journalists, new generation of journalists, is more aggressive or more daring in terms of pushing back against this state censorship some. 
>> It's mixed bag. I think people have different views about how china should evolve or how quickly it should evolve, but the liberal journalists are just calling, you know, as in the editorial for an enforcement of the existing constitution which guarantees freedom of speech. They're not calling for political change. 
>> Doesn't sound that radical to me but I guess an entrenched bureaucracy doesn't want to allow these voices. Thanks for educating us on this sunday morning.

>>> Time now for the media monitor. Our look at the hits and errors in the news business. Greta van susteren went back to haiti on friday three years after the devastating earthquake there. The fox news correspondent has been to haiti so many times that a new school and orphanage has been named after her, the greta home and academy dedicated by the reverend franklin graham. 
>> It's life changing for these children to have the opportunity to come to a school like this that has computers, that has just good quality teachers and get a good education. 
>> Stand up, please. Good morning, sir. 
>> Good morning, sir.

[light string music] ?????? ?????? 
>> Steves: Hi, I'm rick steves. Thanks for joining us. To showcase the beauties of public television, we've put together a thrilling european joy ride. In the next half hour, we'll experience europe 
with abandon: Mouthwatering food, fun-loving people, and a vivid culture. From running with the bulls in spain to diving off bridges in bosnia, it's hands-on travel today as europe embraces life with gusto, inspiring us to get the most out of our lives as well. Enjoy this high-energy first segment, and I'll see you at the break. Hold on to your castanets. 
[lively music] ?????? ?????? when you dream of european travel, you might first think of visiting the great museums, wandering awestruck through towering cathedrals, finding meaning in the rubble of ancient history, and savoring cafe culture. But it's important to realize that europe is a vast and diverse continent with many more active ways to experience all it has to offer. It's a continent with incredible natural beauty that's as accessible as it is thrilling. Whether it's riding a canoe in the czech republic into postcard-pretty towns or biking around the pristine isle of aero up in denmark, europe comes with endless ways to get out of the museums and embrace life with gusto. If you've got the strength, you can try kite-surfing in southern spain, or you can always take it easier, wandering the pleasant paths and planked walkways in croatia's plitvice national park. The alps provide plenty of high-altitude adventures, whether hiking switzerland's berner oberland, scaling germany's zugspitze, or climbing high above the valley floor to the ruins of ehrenberg castle in austria. In italy, you can go on a truffle hunt in tuscany or peer into the crater of mount vesuvius just outside naples. And scandinavia gets your heart pumping. You can hike glaciers, explore the swedish archipelago, or go on a high-speed fjord safari. Wherever you go in europe, you'll find opportunities to energize your travels by trying active experiences. And don't forget to party. All over europe, you can join in local festivals and loosen up with new friends. 

[00:03:40]


[upbeat music] Germany and austria have plenty of rowdy beer halls and convivial beer gardens where you can get a simple meal, a huge beer, and enjoy it all with the hometown gang. The most famous place to do this is the hofbraeuhaus in munich. While often full of tourists, it's a great place to cut loose and mix in a little low-brow fun with the high culture of all those museums and galleries. It comes complete with rivers of beer, cheap food, boisterous atmosphere, and raucous oompah music. Munich is the home of the famous oktoberfest, but you can enjoy essentially the same oktoberfest fun any time of the year in a good old-fashioned bavarian beer hall. For just as much fun and a little more intimacy, irish pubs offer travelers a cozy evening over a pint or two with locals. The pub is like a communal living room where children are welcome. Many pubs offer traditional music, creating a mini festival nearly any night of the week. 
[lively fiddle music] ?????? ?????? 
[applause] 
>> Thank you! 
>> Steves: And spain is a fiesta just waiting to happen. In andalucia, many cities have a spring fair. Pick the right town on the right day, and you'll be swept up in the commotion of fancy horsemanship, sherry spritzers, and colorfully clad se??oritas. Polka dots never looked so good. Northern spain hosts one of the ultimate spanish parties, pamplona's festival of san fermin. This multiday celebration has parades for the whole family, serious all-night partying for adults, and its breathtaking running of the bulls. Embracing both its thrills and spills, europeans live life with a bang. My european friends seem to understand that life is good, especially when you live it fully. And we know quality programming, like that which we enjoy here in public television, is part of good living as well. Consider how public television inspires us to get up and embrace life, to really experience our world. That's a treasure. In my travels, I've noticed an irony. So often, people in the poor world live life with a spirit of abundance, and here in the rich world, many of us live our lives with a mind-set of scarcity. I believe supporting public television is embracing life with a spirit of abundance. And right now, that comes with some great travel gifts. With these thank-you gifts, we're celebrating public television and making this station strong in your community. Contribute $60 for the europe through the back door guide book or the new season on dvd. Or contribute $160 for every gift we're talking about: The guide book, the new season on dvd, and the huge 13-disk boxed set with our entire 90-episode series. And at each level, you'll also receive the europe map, tour newsletter, and rick steves smithsonian magazine. Thanks for your calls. It's more important than ever that we have a people's alternative to commercial broadcasting, and this station is it, with a passion for programming that enriches our lives and celebrates our world. When you give at that top $160 level, you'll receive all the gifts, and that includes this dvd boxed set. Here's a little tease, just 60 seconds out of the 50 hours of travel fun packed into this gift. The rick steves europe anthology is the definitive video library of european travel. 90 episodes take you from the fjords of norway to the canals of france, from the wild coast of ireland to enchanting estonia. You'll discover hidden alpine villages, explore modern cities layered with history, feel the thrill of europe's festivals, and relax on the mediterranean. And there are bonuses you'll never see on tv. There's the practical europe through the back doorlecture I've been giving for three decades, some of my favorite scenes that didn't make it into the regular shows, and outtakes, proof that things don't always go as smoothly as it seems. 

[00:08:01]


>> [man speaking] 
>> Steves: I didn't understand a word he said. 
>> Okay. 
>> Steves: For any traveler or europhile, these 90 episodes with 50 hours of video offer a lifetime of travel learning, lessons, and fun. Next up, it's time to eat, and we're in for some unforgettable taste treats. As you watch, consider the value of public television to open up our world, to introduce us to things we'd never know about otherwise. It helps us learn valuable lessons by getting us out of our comfort zone-- into new food, for example-- and exposing us to different ideas. Public television is a positive educational force. It carbonates our lives in a beautiful way. And it happens because of your enlightened support. Now bon appetit. Eating is one of the joys of life, and for europeans, food is almost a religion. They eat with passion. And when we travel, we can mix all the fine culture we see with tasty slices of that culture we can eat. To enrich your experience, make a point to create edible memories by savoring the fine cuisines of europe. The variety is endless, and if you know how to choose a good place, you don't need to spend a fortune. A few basic rules for eating your way through europe. Go for the local specialties. You'll get better quality and price. Eat seasonally. Don't miss truffles on your pasta in fall or fresh berries in norway in summer. Remember, location can make the meal. Bosnia may not be famous for its food, but eating under the bridge in mostar makes a lifelong memory. Most of all, eat fearlessly. 
>> It's very chewy, you will see. 
>> Steves: Oh, that's good. Try things you've never had in places you've never been, and maybe complement that with an extra glass of wine... Or two. Some of the most affordable and enjoyable food in europe can be found not while seated at a table but while standing in the street or in the market. Every country has its own beloved street food. It's fast, cheap, and delicious. In greece, try the corner gyro or souvlaki stand. Gyromeans "turning, referring to the slow turning round of meat, roasted pork or chicken, shaved just for you. Slice up that meat... Toss in a little salad... Add tzatziki, a garlic yogurt sauce, and spices... And wrap it up in a cone of toasted pita bread. I love it. In istanbul, on the golden horn, grab a fish sandwich fresh from the guys who caught it at one of the venerable and very tipsy fish boats. Oh, man. 

[00:11:10]


[people speaking in foreign language] 
>> Steve: This is istanbul fast food. Now, what--this is what kind of fish? 
>> Fresh mackerel. 
>> Steves: For a fun snack any time of da go for the local sweet. For many, thwaffles in belgium are a cultural highlight worth traveling for. In the countryside, don't miss delicacies in the small-town markets. In france's dordogne region, that would be goose liver pate, foie gras. 
>> This should be strong, rit? 
>> Duck is different. Duck is strong. The gooses are sweet. 
>> Yeah, that's a good 
description: One strong, one sweet. You notice the difference? 
>> Steves: Mm-hmm. And chow down at food festivals. The end of april brings the annual artichoke fest in the tuscan town of chiusure. Young and old gather to prepare these bristly and quite addictive treats. They love their artichokes here. 
>> They're wonderful. 
>> Steves: I can see why. It's tasty. Mmm! What is it about these artichokes? 
>> Well, this community brought back this artichoke from extinction. 
>> Steves: This particular species? 
>> This particular species you see here. 
>> Steves: Wow. So they have a festival every year, then, huh? 
>> Every year. 
>> Steves: Tell me about this slow food. This is related to the slow food movement, right? 
>> Absolutely. It's the idea that you have to eat quality and not quantity and that you have to preserve the variety of foods. 
>> Steves: So no chemicals. 
>> No chemicals first but also the varieties. 
>> Steves: Okay. 
>> More variety is better. 
>> Steves: And eat in the season. 
>> Absolutely, always in season. 
>> Steves: I'll be back next year for the artichoke festival. It's great. 
>> Absolutely. 
>> Steves: For a step up and a seat, there are lots of casual bars and bistros, hometown hangouts where you can enjoy local cuisine in comfort without going broke. One of the best examples of this is in spain. Every town tempts you with tapas bars, where you belly up to the bar and just point at things you'd like to try. In denmark, I love the open-face sandwiches, which can be both simple and elegant at the same time. You can munch the best pizza ever for the cost of a fast-food hamburger in naples, where pizza was invented. The rustic simplicity of sausages and fondue seems just perfect high in the swiss alps. A refined lunch of quiche and salad in an outdoor cafe feels just right as you enjoy garden-fresh produce and herbs in france's provence. A paella feast on the beach in spain is one of the tastiest budget food experiences anywhere in europe. And when you get tired of eating like a peasant and want to dine a little dressier, europe has plenty of gourmet restaurants. In countries famous for their high-end cuisine, like france and italy, eating a fancy meal is an essential part of the traveling experience. And it can be just as rewarding in a region like spain. Here in andalucia, along with the melt-in-your-mouth jamon, you can taste moorish influences that come with a whiff of the exotic. No trip to croatia would be complete without the beautifully displayed bounty of the adriatic. Dining on seafood like this can be well worth the splurge. Fine restaurants can surprise you in countries that used to be considered high-cuisine backwaters. In edinburgh, you can forgo the haggis and enjoy duck or lamb with sauces influenced by scotland's old alliance with the french. And in stockholm, spices brought by recent immigrants are enlivening scandinavian staples like salmon and reindeer. Of course, eating with abandon means indulging in dessert. Once again, there's a range of options from the high end, like an apple souffle in brittany, to a more casual but exquisite treat, like cream cake in slovenia to gelato in italy. Immersed in a people-filled passeggiata, you realize life is good. Wow, nothing empty about those calories. I've been thinking about the power of media in our society. We are what we eat; we all know that. And it's the same when it comes to tv. 

[00:15:47]


Consider this: The ideas and entertainment we consume are like food for our brains. It shapes who we are both as individuals and as a society. Sure, junk media, like junk food, can be fun. But for a society to stay healthy, we need a balanced diet with quality media. That's where public broadcasting comes in. It offers a full array of programs, giving us a cultural diet that's low in fat, not sugar-coated, and high in moral fiber. Since the media shapes our outlook so powerfully these days, we need to be careful about who controls it. If only a handful of powerful companies control what media is available to us, we end up with fewer choices and fewer perspectives. It weakens the richness of public discourse. How do we prevent that? That's what this membership drive is all about. With your contribution, you can help keep public broadcasting a strong voice in the ever-narrowing media landscape. Lately, powerful forces here in the united states find public broadcasting a threat. It's hard to appreciate how vital an element public broadcasting is in our society until, god forbid, it's gone. This pledge drive isn't a drag; it's a celebration of the power of the individual to make a difference. This is your chance to help make this station strong. If you understand that, then you know that calling right now is flat-out good citizenship. Consider these thank-you gifts, and then please give us a ring. If you'll support this station with a contribution of either $60 or $160, we have some great thank-you gifts. Contribute $60, and take your choice of two gifts: Our new season on dvd-- that's ten shows, with episodes on spain, morocco, croatia, bosnia, scandinavia, and much more-- or, for $60, you can receive my 700-page how-to-travel guidebook, europe through the back door. It's packed with practical and money-saving tips so you can enjoy the best possible vacation. Or, for $160, we'll thank you with both those gifts, PLUS OUR BOXED SET OF DVDs. This 90-episode, 13-disk anthology contains every show we've ever produced, including our new season. With this, you'll have our new shows twice, so you can give the new season dvd to another traveler. And at either level, you'll receive three extra gifts: My rick steves europe planning map, locating all those hard-to-find discoveries; this year's tour newsletter, describing the 30 different bus tours my staff and I lead; and a copy of the smithsonian magazine that showcases my favorite 20 destinations in a gorgeous coffee table special edition. Make that call, and make your choice: 60 for our new season on dvd or the europe through the back doorguide book, or $160 for absolutely everything, both those gifts plus that 90-episode dvd anthology. Thanks for making public television vibrant in your community. As a tour guide, I love to pack each day and each dvd with as many experiences as possible. If you enjoyed that last segment, you'll love the 50 hours of travel IN THIS BOX OF DVDs. I also like to help others learn from my experience and travel smarter. That's why we've included my most important guidebook as a thank-you gift at both levels today. Europe through the back door, updated with 100 days of research every year since 1980, is now out in its 30th edition. Throughout my european travels, I take careful notes and pack the lessons I learn into this 700-page handbook. 

[00:19:19]


Myoal: That you gain from my experience so you can travel smoother and more economically. Europe through the back door is packed with practical tips. All the essential travel skills are covered, from chapters on packing light and planning a smart itinerary to eating your way through europe and finding great hotels. You'll discover how to double your cultural experience for half the price. And the book features chapters on my 40 favorite getaways, the most enchanting corners of europe, discoveries I call the "back doors." The savings from the tips you'll learn will earn back the cost of this book on your first day in europe. We americans need to use both our time and our money smartly, and that's what europe through the back door is all about. Up next is a visual extravaganza of european fun and culture illustrating how people all around the world embrace life differently but with equal enthusiasm. Thanks so much for helping public television enrich our lives by inspiring us to live every day to its fullest. Sure, travel is full of towering monuments and grand experiences. But it's more than the blockbuster sites that make it into the grand tour. So often, it's the little serendipities and impromptu encounters that stay with you and enrich your life. Allow yourself to be spontaneous. Be open to new experiences. When in turkey, go to a cafe and smoke a hookah. In spain's galicia, try some freshly snipped octopus. When in budapest, lose your inhibitions for an hour or two, soaking with hungarians in one of their venerable spas. Take a moment and appreciate street musicians you'd walk right by at home. In greece, slip quietly into the 12th-century byzantine chapel, and risk having a mystical experience. 
[sheep bleating] When a flock of sheep blocks your way in ireland, it's your chance to chat with a shepherd and shake his calloused hand. Crack open a beer on the wharf in copenhagen, and listen to some jazz. Walk with the pilgrims a while in the camino de santiago, and be inspired by their dreams. Or leap into the river in switzerland's capital city, and cool off with the locals. Whether you're gazing awestruck at leonardo's last supper or just eating some crazy taste treat... Pigs' ears. I never thought I'd be eating actual pigs' ears. Travel is about breaking out of your routines, being spontaneous, and living life with abandon. 

[00:21:55]


[lively music] ?????? ?????? watching that final segment, I was thinking that whether you're running with the bulls, jetting across some fjord, or just quietly savoring a fresh new perspective, public television can be our window on the world. It's really important. Today our nation is faced with complex and unprecedented challenges both at home and abroad. We need thoughtful media that boldly and honestly grapples with these issues. We need programming that respects our intellect, assumes an attention span, and is not beholden to advertisers. We need one place on the dial that belongs tw us. This public television station is a national treasure. It's a treasure for our families, for our communities, and for our nation. This is your final boarding call. Please join us.

Description: The facts about the flu and what is different about this year's flu season.

Hollywood is also trying to cash in on the frenzy. But for now, fans can get their fill of ana and christian on stage. Felicia taylor, cnn, new york. 
>> I'll be back here in 30 minutes. "Sanjay gupta md" is next. 
>>> Hello, and thanks for joining us today. I'm going to bust one of the biggest myths about the flu. And hopefully teach you how to protect your family from this epidemic. 
>>> Also, the legendary surgeon who has worked on more top athleteshan just about anyone. He just operated on the redskins' quarterback, rg3. And a fitness dilemma. Why you don't want to watch your weight too closely. We'll explain. Let's get started. ???????????? 
>>> by now you've heard, it's the worst flu season in years. Emergency rooms in many places are overflowing. At least 20 children have died. Among them, a young man named max from texas. Take a look at his picture. His mom said he went from being a healthy, 17-year-old to dying. In just a matter of days. It is a fast-moving story. So here's what you need to know. The flu strikes fast. And symptoms much more severe than a common cold. You feel fine one day, and then the next, a sudden fever, sore throat, headache, and tightness in t chest. 
>> Over 200,000 people every year are hospitalized with influenza. And anywhere from 3 to nearly 50,000 people will die each year. 
>> Flu cases are at epidemic proportions now at some areas of the country. It's the most we have seen this time of the year in a decade. 

[00:02:00]


>> They may get more complications from this particular h3-n2 strain, which may make them ill for a longer period of time. 
>> The active strain is h3-n2. It typically surfaces earlier in the season, tends to produce stronger symptoms. And it is highly contagious. In fact, when someone coughs or sneezes, these tiny droplets are released into the air. You can't see them with the human eye. They can live on surfaces for eight hours. Say your co-worker is sick. You come over, use their key board, you've got the germs on your hand and then you touch your nose or mouth, and now you're infected. And the problem escalates if you spend several hours in tight quarters. Like on an airplane. At highest risk, passengers two rows in front or behind the infected person. The best way to kill those germs is to wash your hands and do it often. And use real soap and real water. The problem is that most people don't actually wash their hands long enough. My best advice, actually sing the happy birthday song twice while you're washing your hands. That's going to be long enou. Not quick to get rid of these viruses. Another key to prevention is getting the flu shot. Getting vaccinated. Reduces your risk of getting the flu by around 60%. Now another benefit to getting your flu shot is if you do get sick, your symptoms may not last as long. Won't be as severe. As compared to those who weren't vaccinated. You know, we've been getting a lot of questions about the flu from you at home. I want to bring in one of my producers, ben tinker. You've been filtering through a lot of questions for us. What are you hearing? 
>> Tons and tons of questions. First and foremost, people are wondering where they can get the vaccine, saying they can't find it. A lot of people want to know if there is a shortage. 
>> The best way to describe it as spot shortages, a lot of doses out there, 135 million manufactured. 128 million were distributed. 112 million have been given. That means there's 16 million still out there. Now it's a question of putting them in the right spot. So I think best bet is if you can't find it, your usual pharmacy, look somewhere else. 

[00:04:06]


>> Right. A lot of people want to know, too, and these would be friends of mine, not friends of yours, who thought they could get the flu from a flu shot. And you say that's absolutely not true. 
>> Some of my friends have asked that question as well. That is a myth. And is I think we can 'tis pens with this right now is saying that it's actually a dead virus. And an inactive virus. This is the flu shot here. You can't get it from this. But what can happen, ben, and for everybody else, once you get this shot, you're actually activating your immune system. And when you activate the immune system, that's often what makes you feel cruddy. It's not the virus itself, it's your immune system. That's not the flu. That's your body doing what it's supposed to do. 
>> So when you start to feel cruddy when is the time to go to the hospital and stay on the couch, chicken noodle soup, flat ginger ale? 
>> All of mom's advice. For most people, it's going to be exactly what you just described. You need to get rest, to let your immune system recover, drink plenty of fluids, because you can get dehydrated. Take a look at the list. If you have sudden dizziness, certainly if you have difficulty breathing, if you have pressure in the chest area. And this last one important as well. If your symptoms improve, you think you've beat the flu but the fever returns, that could mean you have a secondary infection. 
>> One last question. Our viewer michael in philadelphia wanted to know, 50,000 people the cdc says can die every year. That sounds like a lot. How does it happen? How does it get to that point where it can be so dangerous, so deadly? 
>> Let me show something that i think is really important. When you think about somebody having the flu, you're sort of counting on their immune system starting to take over. Your immune cells are sort of all over your body and your bone marrow, for example. But let's say your immune system has done its job and it worked really hard to basically fight the flu. What can happen after that is you can develop secondary infections. Most commonly, these secondary infections will affect the lung. Known as staphylococcus. And if you look at what happened especially in young people who died from the flu. It's not the virus itself that the body has combatted but that secondary infection from a bacteria. So definitely keep those questions coming. Thank you very much, ben. Coming up on the show, we're going to talk to dr. James andrews. He's the surgeon to the redskins, rg3. You may remember this thing. He's a doctor who has literally treated hundreds of stars. He's going to join us next. By blocking some of the fat you eat. Let's fight fat with alli. ?????? ?????? diabetes... Your doctor will say get smart about your weight. I tried weight loss plans... But their shakes aren't always made for people with diabetes.

Side effects may include headache, upset stomach, delayed backache or muscle ache. To avoid long-term injury, seek immediate medical help for an erection lasting more than four hours. If you have any sudden decrease or loss in hearing or vision, or if you have any allergic reactions such as rash, hives, swelling of the lips, tongue or throat, or difficulty breathing or swallowing, stop taking cialis and get medical help right away. Ask your doctor about cialis for daily use and a 30-tablet free trial.

>>> Athletes today are able to come back strong from injuries. That once would have ended their careers. Take adrian peterson, for example. He nearly set the nfl running record less than a year after tearing his acl ligament in his knee, and everyone has seen redskins' quarterback robert griffin iii, rg3, he also came back from a torn acl and then went down again at the end of a playoff game. He just had an operation to fix his acl again and also his lcl ligament. Dr. James andrews performed the operations on griffin and on peterson. I'll tell you, dr. Andrews is far and away the star of his field. He's team dr. For the redskins, for the devil rays, football teams at auburn and university of alabama. They've done okay this season. He found time to author a new book called "any given monday." Dr. Andrews, a real honor to have you on the show. 
>> Well, it's my pleasure to be here. 
>> Sir, obviously you've been busy the last several days. I want to ask you a few questions about just football and so of what you do in general. The nfl, as you know, has rolled out new sideline exams designed to keep athletes off the field if they have a concussion. I'm curious, when you think about that, is that sort of model possible for other injuries, like ankles or knees or shoulders? 
>> Well, I think there's improvement to be done in all categories. You know, in the heat of the battle on the sidelines at an nfl game, it's sometimes tough. And professional athletes, the last ones to try to take themselves out of a football game. 
>> I want to show a little bit of what -- these knee ligaments for people who are curious about the anatomy here. The knee is held together by several different ligaments. The medial collateral ligament, the posterior ligament. The lateral collateral. There's about 2,000 people who injury their acl every year. Half get operations, roughly. We looked at some of the data. If you're not a famous athlete, dr. Andrews, can you still recover like an adrian peterson did, for example? 

[00:11:25]


>> Well, you've got to realize that an athlete of that caliber has such tremendous genetics and abily. Also has an ability to recover. And if you try to take an average sunday warrior with that same injury and try to expect the same result in that lower level athlete, then you can't really compare the two with their recovery. And I've said this often. If you operate on the right caliber athlete, they make you look pretty good as a physician. 
>> What do you tell people, especially parents or coaches of young players, in terms of preventing these injuries in the first place? 
>> The nfl now has sideline replay cameras where we can go and review retrospectively what happened. Which is a new thing this year on the sidelines. Which helps in the nfl. The problem with sports, though, is that the best care of an athlete is at the professional level, and the least care is at the high school and junior high school level. And our high school and junior high school kids are more vulnerable to injury. And so we're upside down with the care of athletes. These young kids really need more supervision. They need athletic trainers. That's one of the things we're working on in multiple states. There should be an athletic trainer in every public high school, because that's where minor injuries occur. And if they're recognized early by the trainers, then you can prevent minor injuries from becoming major injuries. And that's really important with any injury, particularly, as you noted, as you talked about with concussions. 
>> Dr. James andrews, again, really appreciate you being on the show. I think a lot of people have a lot to learn from you. Appreciate it, sir. 
>> Thank you very much. It's a pleasure. 
>>> I've talked a lot about the dangers of football and its big hits. Last spring, former nfl linebacker junior seau, a sure hall-of-famer, he killed himself, shot himself in the chest after showing some bizarre behavior. And the question came up immediately, had he suffered brain damage from all those concussions? Well now it appears he did. Exams of seau's brain by the national institutes of health revealed he suffered from chronic traumatic encephalopathy, cte. It's a degenerative brain disease with alzheimer's-like symptoms. Mood swings, aggression, memory loss and depression. And it happens when repeated hits to the head lead to a build-up of proteins in the brain. And you can see the difference under the microscope. The clean, white brain, a normal brain. The brown, spotted brain, a cte-impacted brain. More than 30 former professional players have been diagnosed with cte. T dr. Russell lonzer who oversaw seau's examination says we still don't know how big the risk is. 

[00:14:19]


>> We need to understand better the incidents prevalence. We need to develop diagnostic tools to diagnose it, potentially, before someone passes away. We need to better understand the etiology of it so we can better manage this disorder in the future. 
>> But keep in mind, we hardly even talked about cte just a few years ago. There are mysterious components of it that we're going to stay on top of. 
>>> Up next, how to avoid diet pitfalls with real science. Coming back with dr. Robert lustig right after this. 

[00:17:39]


>>> Over the last few months, you've probably heard me talk a lot about the importance of limiting sugar in your diet. And a lot of that knowledge is based upon the work of dr. Robert lustig. He's the author of this new book called "fat chance." You and iave talked about this before and you're not talking about just adding to your waistline or pounds to your body. You're talking about something in the way that these substances behave in the body. 
>> That's right. We're not talking about pounds. I think that the worst thing you can do is get on the scale. When you get on the scale, you're measuring four compartments at once. Bone, more is better. Muscle. More is better. Subcutaneous or big butt fat, if you will. More is better. In fact, people with larger amounts of subcutaneous fat have increased longevity. And belly fat. More is worse. But that's only 4% of your total body weight. So when you stand on a scale, what are you measuring, you can't know. So it's not about weight, it's about waste. That tells you where the metabolic dysfunction is. The problem is, there are a lot of people out there who are normal weight who have that same metabolic dysfunction as the oobese do, they just don't know it. 40% of normal weight people have metabolic dysfunction. They are as in this issue as the obese are. 
>> We see, they call it skinny fat, I see, right, people who look skinny but then they have large waists. 
>> Not even just large waists. They can have normal waists. Jimmy bell, a neuro imageer at cambridge, university of college london calls it tofi, t-o-f-i. Thin on the outside, fat on the inside. WHEN YOU DO MRIs INSIDE, YOUAN Actually see the fat in all of the organs. The muscle, the heart, et cetera. Bottom line is, from your weight, you can't tell where you are. 
>> So how -- so what do you do? How can you tell, first of all? 
>> Well, in fact, the best way is, again, waist circumference. That's the cheapest way. There are some lab tests your doctor can do, a fasting insulin and some liver function tests that can give you clues as to whether or not there is a problem or not. But the single best way to deal with excess fat is to get it off and the easiest way to do that is to exercise. The problem with exercise is, every doctor will tell you, if you exercise, you would lose weight. That's because they say a calorie is a calorie. So if you burn them off, you would lose weight. Guess what, there is not one scientific study, not one reference that you can point to that says that exercise causes weight loss. What it does is causes muscle gain and missile has mi to kondrrhea, and that is the energy-burning factories inside of the cells and tlf, you won't turn it into liver fat or muscle fat, but burn it inside and you will be healthier, but it won't show up on the scale. 

[00:20:33]


>> So exercise revs up the energy and you burn more effectively rather than storing as fat. 
>> Basically when you eat something it has one of three fates. You can burn it which is the best, and you can store it which is not so good or go out in the urine which is type two diabetes and that will kill you, so which would you rather have it? 
>> So we try to give you advice that is based in science here, and the doctor has plenty to say here about sugar. This month, I got to visit the consumer show in las vegas and nothing in that space but gadgets. So what are we looking at here. 
>> This is a puzzle box orbit and it is a brain-controlled helicopter, so if I stop talking for a second and concentrate on the bar, I will be able to make the helicopter fly. Just like that. We are looking at my brain waves between 12 and 20 hertz, and if I am that focused, it will trigger the helicopter. 
>> Reporter: This is decidedly low tech and hard to believe it is here at the high-tech show, but it is the back end with all of the technology, and andrea, thank you for joing us, and what is this here? 
>> It is a fork designed to help you eat more slowly. Every time I put food to my mouth, it is a timer. In this case, we have ten-second timer and if I put food in my mouth under that time, it will vibrate thanks for the vibration at the end of the fork. It is gentle and we don't want to electrocute anybody, but a very mild vibration. 

[00:22:47]


>> Reporter: The thing about the insurance company helping to sponsor something like dance, dance revolution, how does that come about? 
>> Well, part of the job is to heldp people live healthy and we know that preventable disease is the number one cost driver and if we can beat childhood obesity and adults, that will lower the cost for everyone. 
>> Reporter: And a gentle note for exercise and to take care of the diet, sometimes the technology can help as well, as you saw there. 
>>> Now a former emergency room physician is telling us to slow down. It seems that we are plugged in 24/7 and he is going to make a case for going full throttle 24/6. ?????? ?????? ?????? I don't wanna be right ??????

>>> Imagine a 15-year-old girl told by her doctor that she may not live for another week by something that she is doing to her body. Well, there is this girl, chelsea, but the old adage applies, what doesn't kill you makes you stronger. When you see her vibrant, it is hard to believe that she remembers the day that part of her brain died. She suffered a stroke brought on by severe anorexia. 

[00:27:15]


>> I know from looking at the hospitals that I was 58 pounds. 58 pounds and close to dying because so many parts of the body were dying there. Are no pictures of her at her sickest. This is a picture from the year earlier when she was in and out of treatment centers, but she remembers starting a diet with her mom in the midst of a dangerous childhood spiraled out of control and nearly killed her. 
>> Looking back, my body was the only way to tell the people around me that I was not okay and I was scared and I needed help. 
>> Help came for roff when she was hospitalized for 18 months following her stroke. 
>> I had a bed and nurses and doctors that showed up everyday and were consistent and I had food and I had water, and I was finally getting like digestive function back. 
>> As part of the recovery, her therapist suggested that roff try yoga to listen to the body again without burning too many calories and almost immediately, she was hooked. 
>> Before I knew it, I had gained 20 or 30 pounds and was teaching yogat a juvenile detention center and it became a sort of love affair for me. My name is chelsea and I'm a patient of dr. Wootton. 
>> Reporter: Today, she writes and shares her struggles with eating disorders with her loved ones. 
>> I tell girls, I'm??not afraid of my fullness. 
>> Reporter: She is quick to point out that owe ga is not a cure for anything. It is one of the tools that if used correctly, hit elped to relive her life. 
>> You can live in your body fully and have happiness and for me, that is the biggest thing. Eating disorders are eating disorders that coexist with anxiety and depression. You can find more on nationaleatingdisorders.Org.

>>> Ever since I came across this new book about a doctor who says that he came up with the prescription for living longer, and he says just stop. 
>> For 2,000 years western culture primarily stopped on sunday for about 24 hours, even when I was a child you could not buy gasoline or milk and the drugstores were not open, and the only thing that was open was a hospital. 
>> You know, I think that he is right, dr. Sleeth, because we all need a day of rest. For some of us, it is getting active and going for a long walk and for others, a time to become still. I like to call it hitting the reset button and something that

>> Annououncer: The following spsponsored program is brought to YOU BY CarMD. From beautiful tampa bay, florida, it's the sangs shopping channel. This check engine light says this car needs a repair, but these car owners have no idea what's wrong, or what it will cost. Is it a $200 oxygen sensor, a $2,000 catalytic converter, or just a loose gas cap? How can we know which one it is? And how do we prevent getting ripped off at a repair shop? Imagine if you could analyze your car's repair problems at home, before you went to the repair shop. How much could you save? 
>> I saved over $825. 
>> CarMD ACTUALLY SAVED ME 1500. 
>> WITH CarMD I SAVED OVER 3,000. 
>> CarMD HAS SAVED ME OVER 5,000 just dealing with two cars over a six-month period of t 
>> Announcer: And now, here to TELL YOU HOW CarMD CAN SAVE YOU Thousands of dollars on your auto repairs is the host of the savings shopping channel, mel arthur! 
>> Hi, I'm mel arthur and welcome to the savings shopping channel. Now, as you know, the savings shopping channel is the place to save hundreds, even thousands of dollar if it doesn't save you money, it's not on the savings shopping channel. Now, we are talking about huge savings today-- not just big savings-- we're talking about huge savings. I'm talking about $500. I'm talking about a thousand dollars. I'm talking 2,000, 3,000, 4,000, EVEN $5,000 OR MORE WITH CarMD. Now, you're probably saying to YOURSELF, "$5,000 WITH CarMD, How is that possible?" With this little device. Let me tell you what it does. When you have a problem with YOUR CAR, YOU TAKE OUT CarMD And you plug it into the data port of your car, that's usually found right under your steering wheel on every single car that's ever been manufactured since 1996. You plug it into that data port AND CarMD WILL TELL YOU EXACTLY What is wrong with your car. That's amazing! Exactly what's wrong with your car. Is that not worth $500, to have that kind of knowledge, to be able to go into an auto repair shop, to know exactly what's wrong with your car? But we're not done. CarMD GETS EVEN BETTER THAN THAT BECAUSE CarMD NOT ONLY TELLS YOU What's wrong with your car, it also tells you the parts that you need to fix your car. That should be worth another $500, right there. But it gets even better than that. It not only tells you what parts you need, it also tells you how much the parts are for your car and how much the labor should be, right down to your very zip code. CarMD IS LIKE A DOCTOR For your car. It connects to the data port under your dash and interfaces with the onboard computer system of your car, examining the status of all the major systems, including the safety system, to determine the up-to-the-second health of your vehicle. I want you to hear from some folks right now that have had the typical horror stories that we've all had in the repair SHOPS AND LISTEN TO HOW CarMD Saved them money. 

[00:03:12]


>> When I came to a red light and the car would stall, I was very, very vulnerable. I TRIED SEVERAL TIMES WITH TjE Dealer-- their quote was $2200. I GOT OUT MY CarMD. It showed that I needed a knock sensor. I found a replaceable knock sensor for $65, and compared to $2200, me spending almost $70 for the repair... What an enormous savings it was. #!Not only did I save money, my car feels safe again. 
>> My husband just got deployed at iraq and... I don't know what to do now that the man of the house is no longer home. [Chuckles] I had to take care of everything. When I went in for the inspection for my car, they told me there was something else totally wrong with my car. They wanted to charge me $1200 for a repair. I couldn't afford that. SURE ENOUGH, I PUT ON THE CarMD And it told me that it was actually a sensor. I saved over $825 with it. 
>> The service manager comes back and he says, "your computer chip is bad." O.K., And I go, "well, how much is it gonna cost me?" He said, "well, $15- to $1600." And I said, "thank you, I will think about it," and I left. THEN I RAN ACROSS CarMD, THE CarMD DIAGNOSTIC TOOL, Plugged into the car, it gave me a code, the code identified a problem. That problem actually was a repair that cost less than a hundred dollars and the check engine light has never come on again. I saved $1500. 
>> Aren't those stories absolutely amazing? THE SAVINGS WITH CarMD ARE Fantastic, and the peace of mind YOU GET WITH CarMD IS Unbelievable. It's not just a device that's going to tell you what's wrong with your car, how much it's gonna cost to fix your car, what the parts are, what the labor is-- it's so much more than that. Let's say you're driving along and you get that dreaded check engine light come on. It's kind of like the blue screen of death on your computer. You know you're gonna have a bad day. 
Here's what you do: Pull over to the side of the road, take the CarMD OUT OF YOUR GLOVE BOX AND Plug it into the data port. If you get a yellow light, that's going to indicate that what you have is a minor problem. In fact, 30% of all check engine lights end up just being a loose gas cap, something that you can fix yourself. JUST DRIVE HOME WITH YOUR CarMD, Plug it into your computer, get a complete report and you'll find out exactly what you need to have done with your car and how involved the repair is going to be. However, if you get a red light, now you should be concerned because you may have a major problem with your car. You're gonna see some codes come ACROSS THE SCREEN ON YOUR CarMD. If you're not sure what those codes are and you're not anywhere near a computer, it's 

[00:05:53]


REAL SIMPLE: TURN THE CarMD Over. Embossed on the back of the unit is an 800-number. That connects you to our customer support center, which is staffed by a.S.E. Certified technicians. Simply tell them what the code is, they'll tell you what the problem is, and if you're not sure how to get a tow truck at you, they'll even call one for you. CarMD WILL SAVE YOU MONEY AND Give you peace of mind. If all it did was help you do repairs on your car, if all it did was help you with check engine lights, that would be worth a thousand dollars. But there's still more. How about buying a used car? How big a mistake can you make if you buy a lemon when you buy a used car? But how do you check the car out? You can get a carfax report and maybe the carfax report tells you the car's been in an accident or maybe it's been repaired. Maybe the outside of the car looks great but you don't know what's going on with the major systems inside the car. SIMPLY PLUG IN THE CarMD. If you don't get a green light, you're not buying that car. Let me tell you how important that is. I want you to hear from folks who are in the business-- people that sell used cars, people that go to the auto auctions. Listen to what they have to say ABOUT CarMD. 
>> I sell used cars for a living AND I THINK THE CarMD IS A GREAT Tool to use for somebody buying a car to let them know if there's an existing problem. 
>> A lot of cars come through the auctions that I work with and I've got to be able to find out if they're good, if they're bad instantly. TO PLUG IN A CarMD AND FIND OUT Within seconds as to what the condition of that car is is just great for me, it really works. 
>> So what did we learn? CarMD CAN HELP YOU TO REPAIR Your car. CarMD CAN HELP YOU TO DIAGNOSE Your car when you're on the road when you get a check engine light. CarMD CAN HELP YOU BUY A used car. SO YOU CAN SEE THAT CarMD IS Gonna save you money like you've never saved before. And it's an amazing piece of technology, because you see this right here? This is what the automobile technicians use in the shops. This is a typical device that cost $2,000, great technology. WELL, CarMD STARTED OUT IN THE Business originally 43 years ago manufacturing these diagnostic tools, and they've been doing that for 43 years. They have sold millions of diagnostic tools. But, the key to what they were able to do for the consumer was to develop a database that had every car, every make, every model, every manufacturer since 1996, foreign and domestic. This database is msive. The permutations and combinations of all of this data represents billions of possibilities that have to be in that database. And that database is updated every 24 hours by thousands of a.S.E. Certified technicians THAT ARE ON STAFF FOR CarMD. So the big question comes right now... "Mel, this is great savings. This is unbelievable. I'm dying to get one. How do I get one?" You're gonna love what I'm gonna tell you right now. We are doing the most amazing offer that has ever been done at the savings shopping channel. I'm going to tell you right now the phone lines are gonna absolutely blow up. When the phone number comes up on the screen you will want to be there immediately because you are gonna love this. If I told you right now that CarMD WAS A THOUSAND DOLLARS, You would probably say, "mel, for everything it does, for the peace of mind I get, for not getting ripped off in a repair facility ever again, worth every penny-- not even close." If I told you it was just $500, I mean, think about the savings. In fact, I haven't even mentioned recalls. Recalls are free repairs that you get with manufacturers. You don't know about them, you forget about them. You never see the letters when they come in the mail. WELL, CarMD IS GONNA TELL YOU About the recalls, so that's easily worth $500 because of all the free repairs you're gonna GET WITH CarMD-- NOT EVEN CLOSE. Not even $400. At $300, every phone line in america is going to call in for CarMD BECAUSE THIS IS THE Biggest savings you've ever seen in the automotive industry. You're gonna save on parts, you're gonna save on labor, you're gonna save on mistakes. You're not gonna get ripped off by a repair facility because you didn't know what was going on. But we're not even close to 300. At $200, everybody's calling their friends and neighbors. They say, "you've gotta get in on this. You've gotta have one. We gotta get a couple of them. Everybody in the family needs to have one at $200," but again, we're not even in the ballpark. Not even 190, not even 180, not even 170, not even $160-- at $150 it's a sellout! But we're not done. That's still not there. Not even 140, not even 130, not even $120. IF YOU WANT CarMD WE'LL SEND IT Out to you absolutely free-- f-r-e-e-- absolutely free to try for 30 days. Put it in your glove box, drive around a thousand miles with it, take it to a repair facility, shop for a used car, check out five used cars, 10 used cars, use it on your wife's car, your husband's car, your children's car, your parents' car. Use it for 30 full days and if for any reason you don't fall in love with it, if you're not amazed by the savings, if you don't get that great peace of mind, if you feel like you're never gonna be ripped off again, send it back and you owe nothing because we didn't charge you a penny, nothing, zero, nada, zippo, nothing, not a single CENT TO TRY OUT CarMD. Now, if that was just it right there, this would be the best deal you've ever seen on the savings shopping channel. But we're still not done. For everybody that calls in right now, we're gonna give you THE CarMD ACCESSORY KIT, YOU SEE It right here. THAT INCLUDES THE CarMD EXTENDER CABLE, THE BATTERIES, THE CarMD CD AND YOU GET THE CarMD CADDY THAT KEEPS YOUR CarMD NICE AND Safe and tucked away when it's in your glovbox. That's a $50 value that's yours for free if you call in right now, but I'm still not done. CarMD IS SO SURE IT'S GONNA Analyze your car correctly every single time, if it ever makes a single mistake and misdiagnoses your car, they'll pay for the repairs up to $500-- that's their "get it right the first time" guarantee. If this is not the greatest deal you have ever seen on the savings shopping channel, I don't know what is. I don't want you to take my word for it, I don't want you to ta the word of the folks that love THEIR CarMD ALREADY-- I WANT YOU To hear from people who are in the know, that work with these diagnostic tools in shops. WHEN THEY'VE TRIED CarMD, LISTEN To what mechanics and a.S.E. Certified technicians have to SAY ABOUT CarMD. 

[00:12:29]


>> Being a mechanic, uh, I would SAY THE CarMD IS A LOT BETTER Than some of the $5- or $6,000-plus diagnostic machines that you can buy from other companies, with the simple fact that you can plug it into your laptop or desktop and see the parts cost, the labor cost or what it's roughly going to cost you if you were to take it into a mechanic and have them fix it, or if you're mechanically inclined, fix it yourself. 
>> WELL, WITH THE CarMD THAT What impressed me the most was hooking it up to the internet. You have access to their database and it basically tells you what the most probable cause is gonna be. And I checked it out three or four times around, you know, compared to what we found wrong and what they recommended and everything, and it was exactly the same thing. I mean, 100%. And they even give you an estimate as to... You need that repair, how much it's gonna cost, and it was within a couple of bucks of what we would normally charge our customers. 
>> All over television they're TALKING ABOUT CarMD. Awards... Major awards. We're talking about awards from pc world,from mac world,from c.E.S. But I want to talk to you about this award right here because this, to me, is the most prestigious technology award that you can get. We all know that thomas alva edison is arguably the greatest inventor of all time. The man was responsible for almost 1100 different patents and, of course, he's the father of the light bulb. Well, years ago they started the edison foundation to honor the st and greatest, newest technology. Listen to some of the winners of 
the edison award: The onstar anti-theft system, motorola droid cell phone, the apple ipad, and last year, carmd. I want to put this award in perspective in this industry. It's like what the academy award is to movies, it's like what the emmy award is in television, what the tony award is to broadway, what a grammy award is to music-- that'what the edison award is in technology. AND WHEN CarMD CAN WIN AN AWARD Like this and get mentioned in the same breath with the ipad and the motorola droid cell phone and the onstar anti-theft system, you are talking about credibility that is unsurpassed in the automotive industry. 

[00:14:44]


>> All I want with my car and dealing with mechanics is peace of mind. AND WITH CarMD I GET THAT. 
>> CarMD HAS SAVED ME $600 AND Once even saved our family vacation. 
>> CarMD HAS PROBABLY SAVED ME Several thousand dollars over the past few years. 
>> I FIGURE CarMD SAVED ME 1,000 and put it in my pocket. I have a 2000 chevrolet impala that had an intermittent check engine light. Took it into an inspection station, the guy inspected it, he said, "it is the catalytic converter. It will cost you approximately 900 to a thousand dollars, plus the labor for everything to change it all out." It's difficult for me to believe that bechad just passed every environmental test that it was going to be needing. WITH CarMD I WAS ABLE TO Diagnose the problem to leave out, and I was able to fix that problem for four dollars and a few pennies. No check engine light. It has been gone now for well over 12,000 miles and the automobile is riding perfect. 
>> I tell you, the stories just get better and better. Excuse me one second-- dave? 
>> [Whispering, indistinct] 
>> all right. Dave, my floor director, just told me the phone lines are going absolutely nuts. And why not? Because we're talking about huge savings right here. We're talking about 500, a thousand dollars, 2,000, 3,000, 4,000, $5,000-- it could be even more than that WITH CarMD. BUT ALSO WHAT YOU GET WITH CarMD Is peace of mind. That's right, we're talking about peace of mind, not only for the men, but I found this 
very interesting: When I started telling all my friends and NEIGHBORS ABOUT CarMD, ALL THE Women that I talked to said, "mel, we feel disrespected whenever we walk into a repair shop." And I know that seems to be a common thought. Well, I want you to hear from some women right now who've had CarMD, WHO LOVE CarMD, WHO HAVE BEEN EMPOWERED BY CarMD. Listen to this. 
>> I love it! Can't live without it, should always be in my car. 
>> One of the things that really strikes fear in my heart is having car problems and knowing I have to go and face the mechanic. Now, I know that when I walk in there, it's going to be assumed that I have "stupid" stamped across my forehead. BUT IF I HAVE THE CarMD I CAN Run the diagnostic before I go into the mechanic, so he can no longer charge me an exorbitant amount. I LIKE MY CarMD BECAUSE IT MAKES Me feel safe. 

[00:17:12]


>> Women really need to keep in mind that going to the side of the road, having an accident or breakdown not only costs you a lot of money, but is a safety issue for you. CarMD ALLOWS YOU TO REALLY Diagnose to see if there are potential problems and get them fixed before y break down on the side of the road. 
>> Remember, all you have to do WITH CarMD IS PLUG IT INTO THE Data port of your car. It's immediately going to tell you what's wrong with your car, it's going to tell you what parts you need to repair it, how much the parts should be, how much the labor should be in your area. If you have a check engine light, it's going to tell you whether it's a serious problem or a non-serious problem. If you're thinking about buying a used car, you could save THOUSANDS WITH CarMD BY NOT Buying a lemon. And let's talk about recalls RIGHT NOW BECAUSE CarMD IS GOING To tell you about recalls, which are free repairs. Now, we've all gotten recall letters and you know what, they usually end up in the trash. You know why? We all get junk mail on a daily basis and it's mail like, "you owe $98,590 more on your house, I can get you a one percent ing pool, you need a new roof." Maybe you just live in an apartment. You don't really need a new roof, do you? But we all get this junk mail. Well, mixed in with the junk mail is sometimes a letter that comes in a very innocuous envelope, black and white envelope, and that is an automotive recall letter. Now, how many of those have you unknowingly thrown in the trash? That is a free repair. Let me give you an example. If you have a catalytic converter that goes bad on your car and there was a recall for that and you took it to a repair shop instead and paid for it, maybe you spent 500, maybe you spent a thousand, maybe you took $2,000 and threw it in the trash. If you're not aware of your recalls, you could be throwing away money on an annual basis. So we're talking about throwing away big money. BUT YOU'RE GONNA GET CarMD TO Try absolutely free and you'll be able to check all the recalls that you have on your car. 

[00:19:16]


>> When you get that check engine light, it's the worst feeling because you don't know what is it gonna be. It could be a simple five dollar fix or it could be a $2,000 fix. You never know. So it's a bad feeling. The dealership wanted to charge me $1500, but once I found out THROUGH CarMD THAT THERE WAS A Recall for my vehicle, I took it back to the dealer. The dealership was haggling about fixing it or not, but in the end they did fix it because it was a recall. This little thing right here, it's a miracle. 1500 in my pocket. It was the best money I invested. 
>> We se john curley with the CarMD MOBILE TESTING FACILITY TO The west side pavilion mall. He stopped perfect strangers and ANALYZED THEIR CARS WITH CarMD. Wait till you see their reactions when they heard the results. 
>> Mine keeps coming on and off. 
>> Why don't you take it in? 
>> They told me they needed up-front money for them to diagnose it. 
>> They want to charge me a hundred dollars to plug it in and look at it. 
>> I'm afraid of what it might be. Just to bring this thing in is 500 bucks at least to get it tested. 
>> It's $150 just to do the diagnosis... >> Right. 
>> And then they have all of these problems they say it has and then they charge you an arm and a leg. 
>> So what if you could diagnose it yourself? 
>> That would be awesome. 
>> Are you ready? >> Yeah. 
>> All right, here we go. You are about to find out what is wrong with your car. 
So look at this: Big, green check for yowhich means your engine is fine, o.K.? Here's the interesting thing: There's been a recall on the seatbelt latch in the front seat. And here's the beauty-- you ready? Cost? Nothing for you. 
>> Really. >Really. WHAT CarMD FOUND FOR YOU IS YOU Have seven recalls on this car right now, and you were driving around with some brake fluid problem, the fat you had none. >> Oh, my god. 
>> The good news is that the recalls don't cost you anything. Take them in and they would take care of them. How's it make you feel? 
>> Hugely relieved and it's providing me with information that could literally save my life. 
>> There's a rall on this car. There could be a leak in the gas tank and that could also be part of the problem as well. SO WHAT CarMD HAS DONE FOR YOU Is what, john? 

[00:21:16]


>> Saved me about a thousand dollars. I would've had to buy my own gas tank-- didn't know about the recall-- new gas cap and then another 200 bucks to get it diagnosed. 
>> They've got some mysterious machine they plug in and then they know, and now I know. 
>> What do you have? 
>> I HAVE CarMD. 
>> Without question, this is the biggest money-saving deal we have ever offered here at the savings shopping channel. Take a look at this-- thousands and thousands-- 3,000, 4,000, $5,000 in possible savings on your car... Money that you could be throwing in the trash but now you're saving and using for other things. I mean, this is like a stimulus program for america right here. I mean, think about all the savings that people are going to have. I mean, this technology is this. This is a multi-thousand dollar analyzer right here. Through current technology that CarMD HAS BEEN ABLE TO DEVELOP, They have miniaturized it and made it easy and simple to use, that anybody, including my 97-year-old mother, could plug it in and tell what's wrong with her car. Now, I don't let her drive anymore-- that's a good thing-- but anybody can use it. And it's so accurate, if they ever misdiagnose a problem, they'll pay up t$500 to make the repair. What company has ever done anything like that? And remember, they're sending it out to you absolutely free. This is free, free, free. You don't pay a dime, you don't pay a penny, you don't pay a centavo, you don't pay a single cent. You get it absolutely free to try for 30 days. Check out as many cars as you want. Go buy a used car with it. Save a couple of thousand dollars by buying a used car, by checking out the lemons on the lot. Now I want you to take a look at two pictures. This is a lemon. This could be a lemon. Now, this lemon over here looks good on the outside, but it leaves a sour taste in your mouth on the inside. This car looks good on the outside, but we don't know what the current health of that car is on the inside. THAT'S WHERE CarMD COMES IN, Because when you make a mistake in buying a used car-- in fact, I want you to think about this: Do you realize that an automobile is probably the first or second largest purchase you're ever gonna make in your life? If you make a mistake in buying a used car, it could cost you thousands and thousands and thousands of dollars. Now, we asked chris jacobs, who is the host of that nationally televised show, overhaulin'and who is an automotive expert, to go to a used car lot and test OUT FOUR USED CARS USING CarMD In probably under two minutes. Watch how easy it is to eliminate the lemons and find THE GOOD CAR WITH CarMD. 

[00:23:47]


>> Chris: Looking at all the cars out there, it's hard to tell from the outside what's going on inside. CarMD'S PATENTED RED, YELLOW AND Green light system makes shopping for used cars easy and fun. It'll pay for itself the first time you use it and can save you thousands of dollars over the life of your car.

[bell ringing] 
>> a lot of cars come through the auctions that I work with and I've got to be able to find out if they're good, if they're bad instantly. TO PLUG IN A CarMD AND FIND OUT Within seconds as to what the condition of that car is is just great for me, it really works. 
>> As a car expert, I already know about cars, I know how they should feel, I know how they drive. BUT THE CarMD TOOL, IT GIVES ME The information I need to also become a smart car buyer. 
>> I was looking at buying a new car because the dealer shop couldn't find out what the problem was and I really couldn't deal with that, having to do a lot of driving. SO WITH THE CarMD FINDING WHAT The problem was and getting it fixed, I not only saved the money of having to replace spark plugs every few months, but i saved the money of having to buy a new car, which I thought I was gonna have to do. 
>> CarMD PREVENTS SMALL PROBLEMS From becoming big problems. Let me give you an idea. Let's say you've got a bad spark plug in your car, but you don't know about it. Well, that part could be maybe five bucks. But eventually, if you keep driving around with that bad spark plug, you're gonna have a bad ignition coil. And when you have a bad ignition coil, down the road you're gonna ruin your catalytic converter, and that could be another 500, thousand, maybe $2,000 in the trash. So you had a small problem become a big problem. BUT WHEN YOU HAVE CarMD THAT'S Not gonna happen. It's gon diagnose those small problems immediately, saving you money. Now, let's say you're driving around with that check engine light on and you think, o.K., I can tempt fate, nothing seems to be going wrong. But what could be happening in your car is you're using more and more gas because your engine is running richer and richer and richer and you're becoming poorer and poorer and poorer. But that'll never happen WITH CarMD. SO CarMD SAVES YOU MONEY EVERY Time you go to the pump. 

[00:26:03]


>> You know, a lot of people are looking for ways to keep their car longer, and it could help you prevent damage by learning early that there may be a small problem with your car. You take it into the shop, you do preventative maintenance, and then you save the money of the larger, more expensive repair. 
>> The first time you use it it could save you hundreds of dollars off of any repair bill. 
>> CarMD HAS SAVED MY FAMILY At least $800. 
>> MY FAVORITE THING ABOUT CarMD Is just the ease of use, how easy it is to use in the car, how easy it is to hook up to your computer, how easy the website is... JUST EVERYTHING ABOUT CarMD IS Just a breeze. It actually told me that I had a brake sensor out before I even knew the brake sensor was gone. So, my brakes could have went out or they could have locked up. WITHOUT CarMD I COULD HAVE A Breakdown on the road and be stuck somewhere. I then used it on other vehicles and it saved me over $3,000 in the past year alone. I LOVE CarMD-- IT'S ONE OF THE Best tools on the market. 
>> Winner, winner, chicken dinner! I promised my wife I'd never say that on television, maybe she's not watching-- but this is a winner, folks. We're talking about saving a thousand, 2,000, 3,000, 4,000, $5,000 or more. 
LOOK AT THIS: CarMD COULD PAY For itself the very first time you use it, plus you're gonna get peace of mind. You're gonna be empowered with CarMD AND YOU'RE GETTING IT TO Try at home absolutely free, for not a single penny, for 30 days. They're also gonna guarantee if it ever misdiagnoses a repair on your car, they'll pay up to $500 to make that repair-- that's unheard-of! U've never seen anything like that on television. But you have to dial in right now. Why? Because this is a limited, limited, limited-- did I say limited?-- I mean limited quantity. Stay on the phone lines. If you get a busy signal, call back. If you have to sit on hold, stay there. If they're sold out, get a reservation because you will not find this anywhere. This is not available in any retail store. It's not available anywhere else in the world. It is only available here, at the savings shopping channel. Remember, this is award-winning technology, winner of the edison award. Talk about satisfied customers, over a million satisfied customers. Better business bureau rating, a-plus. You can't beat that. You've heard from mechanics, you've heard from used car dealers, from automobile brokers who go to the auctions to buy cars. You've heard from people who are automotive experts, everyday folks who have saved thousands and thousands of dollars with CarMD. This is the single most important purchase you can ever make for your automobile but you've gotta get on the phone lines right now. Don't get ripped off... GET CarMD.

=======================================================

Announcer: The following is a paid presentation brought to you by my pillow, incorporated. Hello, I'm mike lindell. I've invented of the world's most comfortable pillow. I make 'em right here in the united ss. Do not change that channel because the next half-hour is going to change your life. 
[Audience applauds] 
>> it took me a while just to get out of bed and rejuvenate myself again, but after having the my pillow I just feel so much better... Just, everything is just well taken care of, it feels like. And there's no problem anymore. I don't fight with my pillow. 
>> I fall asleep with it right where it needs to be and I go to sleep and I don't think I move nearly as much as I used to, so I don't have the need for other pillows anymore. It's the perfect pillow. 
>> Being made in america is wonderful but it's made right. And to the average consumer, you're looking at helping yourself to help the body help itself more. The pillow's a great place to start. 
>> I'm tonja waring and I am excited to introduce you to our revolutionary new sleep aid that has literally changed people's lives, including mine. It's made right here in america, and you won't find it in any store. But first, let me ask you a few questions. Do you or someone you care about wake up more tired than when you went to bed? Do you wake up with a headache, a stiff neck or that tingling feeling in your fingers? 
How 'bout this: Do you find yourself tossing and turning all night, stacking, folding, re-smooshing your pillows or even flipping it to the cool side just to get comfortable? If you've answered yes to any of these questions, then you, like millions of other americans, simply aren't getting a good night's sleep. My friend and sleep expert, michael j. Lindell, is the founder and inventor of a revolutionary new sleep aid. Mike's here to share with us why getting a good night's sleep is the secret to a happy, healthy life. 

[00:02:10]


>> Hi, tonja. >> Hi. Mike. 
>> Well, it's not only the secret to a happy life, it's critical to your health, and like everybody else out there, I have used my arms, folded my pillows, got migraines in the morning from sleeping on poor pillows and what it is, what i found in my studies over the last seven years is the cervical nerves on each side of your neck need to be held straight in order to get that deep rem sleep that we all need. That's our healing sleep. Healing is critical to one's health and pillows are the problem. There is no bigger problem than pillows. >> Mike, I hear what you're saying. According to the national sleep foundation, the average adult purchases 58 pillows over their lifetime, they own six different pillows at any given time-- and this is what blew me away-- 70% of us do not like our current pillow we sleep with every night. What's going on here? 
>> Well, I just happen to have some here. [Laughs] these, these pillows, uh, in THE LAST 30 YEARS, IN THE 1970s, Pillows kind of changed forever and we've all slept with this pillow here. This pillow here is, uh, it pushes back. You know when you sleep on your back, you feel that pillow. 
>> Yeah, yeah. 
>> It's like spring, it's like pushing back at you. 
>> Oh, right. 
>> You're on your back and you're like this with a tilted neck, you wake up in the morning, you've bent your precerebral arteries and you're gonna get headaches. This is no good. 
[Audience laughs] okay, this pillow here, it becomes a hard surface. We've all slept in that, with the curve. The problem is pillows give you support here and here, nothing where your c1 and c2 is-- your axis and your ulna. Those are critical to snoring, central sleep apnea, all these different things that you need support in your neck. This one here-- and you also need to be k. This pillow here will heat up, will also become a hard surface and it's no good. 
[Laughter] 
>> what about this one? 
>> This one here has ruined america. We've all slept on this. There's no support. This has done more for bad sleep deprivation than anything anywhere. And another thing too, when you wash these pillows, you know they ball up in a washer and dryer... The big pillow company wants you buying more and more pillows and they don't care about your health. They don't care aboutour sleep. On't care that we keep buying pillows over and over and over again. I just wanted some sleep and i did something about it, and this pillow here, I can't say enough bad things about, but it's terrible. 

[00:04:25]


>> Mike, I love your pillow. It has a great warranty. I lov] that it's made in america. 
>> The best thing you're gonna like about this pillow is I get rem sleep, the deep-healing sleep, the sleep that helps all your, your health, how you feel the next day. I have a patent on this pillow, and what it is, is all three sizes of my fill are in every pillow. This stuff was warrantied 10 years, it won't go flat. It's the healthiest thing ever invented. It's got... It's non-allergenic, it's anti-microbial, but the best thing it does... Wherever you set this, okay, until you first get comfortable on your pillow and you're like this and you go like this and... Now, tonja, I want you to feel that. You see how that holds? 
>> Oh, my gosh. 
>> That will not migrate. Wherever you set it, you get exactly what you need for your individual neck support, okay? You can trim this any way you want. You can make little balloon animals out of it. [Laughter] it's gonna hold. Okay, it takes six pounds of pressure to hohat in position. Your average head weighs 12 pounds, so wherever you set that, you get exactly what you need for you as an individual. It's amazing, it will change your life. There's nothing like it on the planet. It's just amazing. Now, if you're on your back... We've all seen that curve pillow. I think we just threw one away a minute ago. Okay, that curved pillow like that only fits one in 30 people. Remember, we told you that. It gives you support here and here, nothing here. Well, you could be that one in 30, tonja. You take the pillow, you do like this, you tuck it, and you know what? No more snoring, okay? The reason is you're supporting your c1 and c2, your breathing is better. Other companies have said, "oh, yeah, we have this amazing cure for snoring." This will really work. From the testimonials I have from all the pillows I've sold, about 70% of the people don't snore anymore at all. 
[Applause] 
>> what mike hasn't told you is that, already, hundreds of thousands of people have benefitted from sleeping on my pillow. 
>> I give 'em a 60-day money-back guarantee 'cause people, quite frankly, are tired of buying pillows that they can't return and get their money back. >> Yeah. 
>> And we have... Our customer service is the best in the country. We have an a+ rating with the better business bureau and we have zero complaints out of all the seven years I've been in business with the better business bureau. It's the most amazing product and I 100% guarantee it'll be the most comfortable pillow you'll ever own.

[00:08:40]


>> We started with one or two and then, all of a sudden, kids realized that, the kids... I think kalli borrowed mine for the first time, and she said, "i want one of those dad." So I got her one of the pillows, and ever since then, our whole family has 'em. 
>> Healthynormal people need to go to bed, stay asleep and wake up feeling good. When somebody's changing, um, anything in their lifestyle, um, you want to make sure that you're prepared to adapt to stress, and that's what sleep does. It prepares you and improves your ability to respond to stress, and so, right out of the chute, easiest thing I c recommend is my pillow. 
>> In order to get a good night's sleep we need to be in a position that is comfortable. If our body is contorted in any way, we can impinge on nerves that would lead to tingling, numbness, discomforts of various sort. If you could position yourself with a pillow that is comfortable, then these motor and sensory signals that you get in a restless state don't occur and you have a lot more rem sleep. 
>> We're here with sleep expert michael j. Lindell, founder and inventor of a revolutionary new sleep aid called my pillow. 
>> Over the last seven years, what I came up with is a theory, after talking to hundreds of thousands of people that have the pillow... There's eight cervical nerves on each side of your neck, and what they do... They need to be in alignment, okay, to get-- for the signals to go to your REMEMBER THE OLD-FASHIONED TVs That had the horizontal hole, you know, the wavy line when it wasn't clear? When you first get set at night, you first get comfortable on your pillow, your brain says, "okay, I'm comfortable," 'cause your cervical nerves are lined up. >> Yeah. 
>> Well, what happens is the air starts going out of that pillow and they're bent, like bending a water hose, okay? When you do that, you go... 
[Mimics gushing sound] your signal's not going through. Same way with your arteries, your precerebral artery and your carotid artery... The blood flow to the brain needs to be, um, you know, open like a hose. >>At why my concentration is so much br after i sleep on my pillow? 

[00:10:47]


>> That's exactly right. 
>> Good support, which is somehow the miracle of my pillow, uh, throughout the night is what we want. It's nice to fall asleep, but then, as your pillow collapses, you're gonna wake up again 'cause your position's changed. The my pillow, it seems that we're at a state that is comfortable and it stays the same throughout the night. 
>> What dr. Kolodny has to say really reinforces what you've been telling us about my pillow. 
>> What it does.... That it can put you in a deep rem sleep, which is the healing sleep. It's also the most comfortable sleep. When you get comfortable at night, that's what sends you into the rem. That's when your cervical nerves, your neck is lined up. And, interesting enough, what's my theory on this-- this theory was brand new-- and it's true, and it's real and everybody knows that. Now, it's out there because you've all done that with your arms, folded your pillows and done all this and flip-flopped all night like a guppy. Here, you stay with my pillow. Wherever you set this pillow, it's gonna hold, exactly for you as an individual. With my pillow, by keeping all those things in your neck straight, you get the best sleep of your life every single night and guarantee it. We make 'em right here in the united states. The reason why I'm still in business is to help people. That's my calling, that's why I'm here and I want everybody to have the best night's sleep they've ever got in their life. 
>> Absolutely, absolutely! [Applause] I discovered that having my head, neck and spine perfectly aligned all night, whether it's on my side or whether, occasionally, I'm on my back, i can get a perfect cervical curvature, and my aligning that spine, the four cervical nerves running right through the middle of my neck going everywhere in my body and reporting back up, everything is in alignment. It's a phenomenal difference in the way that you're able to sleep. 
>> I fell asleep instantly... Instantly. 

[00:12:50]


>> I have found that I have more energy during the day. I sleep better, I'm not rustling around. My wife used to tell me that i used to flip around and move all over the bed. She has not said that since I've had the my pillow. So it's just been, it's overall has given me a better night's sleep, and again, that's why the rest of my family has the my pillow as well. 
>> With those other pillows that you're getting at the markets, they're just trash, really. They're just... Theycheap. And after you wash them, they bunch up, they're not the same anymore. With my pillow, you can toss it into the wash, you can air dry it, toss it into the dryer. It's such an easy pillow to take care of and it's gonna last you forever. 
>> Earlier we talked about the importance of a good night's sleep which is something i can really relate to. I have to admit, I was pretty skeptical, but michael told me it would really work. And after about two or three weeks, I noticed that all of my migraines had disappeared. And what I really noticed is that I could start going out to the gym, I could start exercising more, because any time I tried to do that before, I just would get excruciating headaches. And so, uh, one of the things... We talk about washing and drying a pillow... I've washed hundreds of pillows where they end up in that clump. Well, I put it in the washer machine and when I took it out of the dryer and when it looked just like it did the day i bought it, I was sold. And that's when I wanted to buy 'em for my kids because my kids are always taking theillow in the car. They're taking it to grandpa and grandma's house, they're throwing it in of the tv and so I'd always end up washing their pillows and I knew that i was spending more money on gas driving back and forth to the department store to buy them a new one. And the other thing that i really wanted and I knew is that if they really started getting a good night sleep now, keeping their cervical nerves in alignment and doing all that stuff for their health that hopefully, when they got to be my age, they wouldn't have the kind of problems that I've had. So it's really important for me that my kids sleep on a great pillow. And they've even commented. My daughter-- I was out working one day-- and she said... I was kind of telling my pillow story, and she said, "mom, I had no idea you were in that much pain." And she said, you know, and I just know that it's made me a much better mom.

>> Hi, mike. >> How you doing, andy? >> Good, I met you at the state fair last year. 
>> Yes, I remember. 
>> And I didn't even know I was looking for a pillow and you saw me and said, "i need to talk to you." And I gotta tell you, thanks, you know? Its changed my life. It's changed the way I sleep. 
[Laughs] I sleep, I think, is the big thing. 
>> It's a miracle. With your big shoulders-- there's a lot of people already like you. You have all kinds of problems because of, you know... 
>> And I'm a side sleeper, I've always been a side sleeper. My arm falls alseep... Not anymore. 
>> Not anymore. That's amazing, yeah. That's why I love some of these pillows, because ofstories like yours. 
>> I take it with me everywhere. >> Right, right. 
>> It's been to texas twice, arizona... 
>> Right. 
>> It didn't go on one trip. 
>> ...That went well for you. 
>> And, well, it didn't work too well. The first night I was down there-- it's two hours away to my wife's folks and, uh, it didn't make it. I woke up, you know, after an hour, two hours, three hours. Finally, five o'clock in the morning, I got up, drove back up to where we live, grabbed the 
PILLOW... >> Tonja: Wow! 
>> There you go! 
>> So, on the second night... [Applause] the second night, I had a good night's sleep. 
>> Mike: Right, that's awesome. 
>> And then, my wife, she'd like to thank you because I don't snore. 
>> Wow, that's a... [Laughs] you're back in the same bedroom! >> It's great. 
>> You know, it just goes to show even someone your size... We help everybody, from the smallest person up to the biggest, you know? 
>> It's great. 
>> That's an awesome story. 
>> And we're gonna see you again at the state fair this year? >> Yes, you are. I'll be there myself. 
>> Thanks. 
>> Thank you. 
[Applause] 
>> andy was so enthusiastic about sharing his story and being here today so i can see why. Thank you, andy. And next we have jennifer. I'very happy to have jennifer up to share with us how my pillow's made a difference in her life. 
>> HI! >> Mike: Hello. 

[00:19:10]


>> Tonja: Hello, jennifer. 
>> How are you guys? 
>> Mike and Tonja: Good. 
>> Good. Um... I just am a busy person on the go. I have two little girls that i! Chase after and I have my own company, a floral design company, and I volunteer every day. So when I go to bed, I really, really need sleep and I've tried pretty much every pillow out 
there: The flat pillows, the firm, I tried a water pillow and those memory foam pillows and i always woke up with a dull headache, just... It was not, you don't have the energy and you can't deal with children when you're dealing with that. I saw my pillow at one of your shows and I thought, you know, I'd invested enough money on pillows that didn't work, so i thought I'd just try it. And that night I had the best night's sleep of my life in years and it's... It's, I've had the best night's sleep every night. I don't toss and turn anymore, i don't wake up with a dull headache. I just really feel good when I wake up. I have energy and i love my pillow. 
>> Did you believe it when you saw the sign that said it did all that? It's too good to be true! 
>> I was really skeptical. My husband is the biggest skeptic ever. He's like, "you want to spend money on a pillow? Go ahead, we'll see what happens," rolling his eyes. And, honest, it worked so well. I love my pillow, love it. 
>> Mike: Thank you, that's awesome. Thank you. 
>> Thank you for making it. [Applause] 
>> I know, mike, that the 60-night money-back guarantee really makes a big difference for people who are skeptical, who know that they want to try a pillow but maybe they're afraid because they have had so many in the past that didn't work. 
>> Right, and I've said, you know, back when I invented this seven years ago, or eight years ago, whatever it's been now, that was the one thing I wanted people to not have, that skepticism, so I gave the... I believed in it so much, that's why I gave the 60-day money-back guarantee so they'd have nothing to lose and everything to gain. You have everything to gain. Your health is the most important thing to your life. >> Absolutely. 
>> And my pillows are more supportive of your health. 
>> Absolutely, hands down. Well, we have another gentleman in our audience his name is michael, and michael,thank you for being here today. 
>> Well, my pillow helped a lot. A few years back I had a medical scare-- I had a jaw joint thatwas getting eaten away by a tumor. The good news is it wasn't malignant, it was benign. The downside of that is when they actually do the surgery, they actually have to sever the muscle that normally fits over your jaw joints, so now, at night, I've found that my mouth would come open and I would start snoring. My wife did not like that very much. So I came across my pillow at a county fair, and I thought, no, I'm not gonna buy a pillow. And he talked to me, he said, "listen, it's a money-back guarantee, try it out. What do you have to lose?" Thought, okay, that's a pretty good pitch, let me try it. That night I slept through the night and it really was one of the first night's that I can remember where I didn't toss. It was a nice, comfortable feeling and I woke up cool and i wasn't getting headaches. So the product does work. Thank you for making what you made. 

[00:22:01]


>> And you don't snore anymore, you said? 
>> I don't snore anymore. 
>> [Laughs] that's amazing. That's why I love selling this pillow, that's a wonderful... It's a miracle product, isn't it? 
>> Yes, it is. 
>> Definitely a life-changer. 
>> Thank you. [Applause] 
>> well, I want to thank you for those great my pillow stories and for joining us today. I know so many of us are grateful for the pillow that you've made, mike. And you get thousands and thousands of testimonials... 
>> I've got one here. I get these all the time, you're right. This is from... I've sent pillows over to afghanistan. This guy, he wrote me. He said, "i'm writing you because I haven't gotten a good night's sleep in over a month. We work 24-hour shifts so getting our crew rest is very important. Right now, I'm sleeping on a cot with a bag full of unused clothes as a pillow--" which can be better than some of the pillows you've slept on! 
>> Some of those we've seen today. 
>> What we did, we sent some pillows and here was their response. "Your pillows came in the mail two days ago, so I was able to test it out for two nights now, and I can't begin to tell you how nice it is to wake up with no neck pain and to bf able to get a good night's sleep. I've already told the rest of my guys how much of a difference your pillow is already making. Thank you so much and god bless, chief warrant officer patrick devlin, afghanistan." And what we've got... 
[Applause] and what I've done since we got that... We've been sending more and more over there to our troops and we've also.... In the united states, just the military bases, to be able to sell in there because they like our product and we've been okayed for... All the way to alaska. And we're helping, you know, not only the everyday people but we're helping our troops through it and it's just amazing. This is why I sell the pillow. 
>> Mike, you just have my utmost respect for your commitment to our troops, for your commitment to the american people, for manufacturing here in the united states, and just what you provide for people's overall health. 
[Applause] I would recommend if you're taking medications to fall asleep at night and coffee to ep you awake in the day that you try my pillow and see what a difference it can make in your life. 

[00:24:07]


>> My pillow is all I need. I don't need two pillows, uh, and I don't need to constantly tuck it in the back of my neck and shoulders to be comfortable as the night wears on. 
>> I work in a physical therapy clinic and we see a lot of patients with stiff necks and sore shoulders and just having difficulty sleeping. And since my experience with my pillow I recommend that they give it a try. 
>> I know that most of us never stop to think about the tremendous difference that a pillow can make to our overall health and well being. But my hope for today is that you'll take this valuable information and you'll experience for yourself the tremendous difference that a my pillow can make in your life. [Applause]

=======================================================

>>> Sinkholes, swallow streets in downtown harrisburg, what can we do to prevent more from popping up? 
>>> Plus, a proud pennsylvania tradition -- the farm show. A dairy farmer talks about milk prices and cows' personalities. Join the conversation next on "smart talk." 
>>> Welcome to "smart talk," I'm nell MacCormack abom. The farm show will soon be a distant memory when it wraps up saturday. With more than 400,000 visitors expected, it's a great opportunity to showcase pennsylvania's agriculture prowess. We'll speak with a local dairy farmer and the pennsylvania farm bureau to get their reaction to the recently passed farm bill expansion. First, hashburg residents spent more than a week dealing with a harrowing sinkhole mess on a main street. For cities struggling financially, it was another crippling blow. Here's "smart talk" producer, heather woolridge. 
>>> Over 40 sinkholes have swallowed downtown harrisburg. The most recent to open is located in t2200 block of north 4th street. It cracked under the weight of a garbage truck making its rounds. Soon after, a portion of the street collapsed, making it completely impassable. Nearby residents were forced from their homes for days while construction and utility crews worked to repair the sinkhole and to repair damage to water, sewer, and gas lines. This is just the most recent sinkhole to pop up. There are 31 holes covered with steel plates throughout the city. Another ten arennnnnnnnnnnnnnnn considered of concern. A hearing is scheduled monday to assess the overall damage sinkholes have caused thughout the city. Officials will review what's causing them, how much it will cost make repairs, and ultimately how to prevent them in the future. A sinkhole problem is not what the cash-strapped city needs. Harrisburg is already trying to deal with high crime, a budget crisis, and potential bankruptcy. Harrisburg isn't the only local community that's had to find a sinkhole solution. The p.A. Geologic survey lists over 30 sinkholes in dairy township. They've caused problems in palmeira for years. Aging infrastructure coupled with erosion are to blame. Updating utility infrastructure like 100-year-old water, sewage, and gas lines are expensive public work projects. Many communities face tough budgetary decisions. When funds are tight, where will the money come from to make these much needed repairs? For "smart ta," I'm heather woolridge. 

[00:02:47]


>> All right. So we want you to put your thinking caps on tonight. What do you think is the solution to the sinkhole problem, to this aging infrastructure that we have? Water, sewer, gas lines, 100 years old. They're going to start breaking. We're going to have problems. What do you think we should do? Call 1-800-729-7532. Send us an e-mail, smarttalk@witf.Org, post to witf's facebook or tweet us, @witfnews. Joining me are kathy pape, president and coo of the pennsylvania american water company. Democratic state repntative patty kimm of harrisburg. A senior geologic scientist at the p.A. Geologic survey. And commissioner wayne gardner from the pennsylvania public utility commission. Welcome to all of you. And all these people have seen this firsthand in some degree or another. Some of them have probably been down in the holes themselves. In the case of kathy pape, you've probably done down with the pipes. I want to talk to you, representative. These are your city, your people. You saw that hole close up, and you talked to the residents who live there. Tell me the impressions of what you saw. 
>> The morning when it happened, my heart sank, you know, we feel like we're getting closer to a solution with harrisburg's finances, and this was the last thing we needed, seeing the back end of a trash truck there stuck 
-- 
>> thank god the driver was unhurt. 
>> It was a 12-foot truck. The whole truck fell down. Thank god no one was hurt. This was a situation that we knew was a problem with the city. We just probably ignored it for too many years. Now here we are. We expect more problems in the future. But I was fired up that day when the media of there because we need to bring attention to this. And I appreciate you having the show today because we cannot ignore it any longer. It's out of sight, out of mind. Out of sight until a trash truck falls in your street. 

[00:04:51]


>> And your you're without water, sewer, gas for a week. You try that in the middle of winter. That is not a pleasant experience. 
>> Some of the residents were so financially tight, they didn't want to buy water. Buying water was a burden for them. And then nowhere to sleep at night. It was -- it disrupted life. When we think ahead, become more proactive, let's find places for residents to stay. It was [ bleep ] for them. I apologize. It was tough for them. Some people worked at home, had to go -- kicked out, couldn't make money. We have to find a better action plan the next time this happens. 
>> I want to turn to kathy pape. You work obviously and run one of pennsylvania's regulated water utility companies. This is not your water situation. But at the same time, you are in 390 communities around the commonwealth. Tell people what is underground. Of the age of the pipes that we're dealing with and this idea that they have a life span like we all do. And the way that works. 
>> Absolutely. Pipe can last 75 to 125 years. So it's -- it has a life, and you can predict when it's born and when it will approximately die. So you have an opportunity to replace it on a systemic basis, or you have a choice to wait until it break. But the latter disrupts people's lives. From our point of view, we think it's better to look ahead. We have a five-year capital plan, to say where will we replace the pipe, which pipe is going to the end of its useful life, what's the make-up of the pipe, how old is it, how many breaks has it had, and to replace it on an ongoing basis. But it's pipe. And I mean, it's not a question of whether tell break. It will break. Just a question of when if it's not replaced. 
>> The guy next to you is our rock expert, the geologist. You actually have plotted around the state where our problem is. First, destroy limestone which is the bedrock under which and within which these pipes exist. And then what is it about where we are in central pennsylvania, the swath I guess of limestone and what happens when limestone gets wet. 

[00:06:59]


>> Okay. A big order. Limestone, it's a type of rock, and it has a unique property. It's more subject to dissolving over long, long, long, long, long periods of time. Real long time. At any rate, it's preferably over the cracks that are in the rock. Over time, it can widen and deepen those cracks. After a while, they tend to act 
-- the analogy would be in plumbing systems. Where the cracks in the rocks are like the pipes, and water wants to get from the surface down through the pipes, down to the water table someare down below. And so it use those -- that plumbing network in the limestone in order to get down to the water table. Now like most of these natural types of pipes in the limestone, they're typically clogged with soil. And water is sort of like the drano. The water can act as the declogging agent and can either 
-- periodically it can flush the soil out of our natural pipes. And it propagates up to the surface, and we get a hole in the ground. We call it a sinkhole. 
>> We get a lot of those. You have a graphic. Show us first the breadth of the problem we're talking about. There you see it. Those areas in blue represent the prime limestone deposits. That is where you're naturally going to have more susceptibility to erosion, correct? So you can see, we're in that area. The lehigh valley is even worse. So if people think this is just some kind of temporary problem that some communities are having, this is endemic and intricately tied to pennsylvania itself. 
>> Correct. We can look at the problem going from allentown, bethlehem, easton, and just go right on down the valley up through reading to lebanon, including harrisburg and thenr to carlisle, down to chambersburg, maryland, and keeps going on into virginia and maryland. And the problem is not just unique to harrisburg. I mean, you can imagine similar types of events occurring all along that corridor where you have the limestone occurring throughout pennsylvania. 

[00:09:15]


>> I want to turn to the commissioner because both representative kimm and kathy pape have talked about the need to plan ahead. Strategic planning. Pennsylvania sort of tookt step in 1997 by establishing a distribution system investment charge which appears on the water -- improvement charge, pardon me. It is an investment for the improvement I guess. Monthly bills for customers, you'll see a little thing called the disc. That charge goes to modernization projects, specifically to prevent these kinds of catastrophic things from happening. You guys only regulate, what is it, 150 water and waste water companies. But pennsylvania has -- 
>> private. 
>> Private. But pennsylvania has 2,200 community drinking water systems that you do not regulate, right? It's up to them to come up with their own financing scheme. 
>> Correct. And part of this being passed in 1997 and originally introduced i think in '96 was because there was a recognition that many of the smaller private water companies were in such bad shape that their needed to be some type of incentive -- that there need to be some type of snemp as kathy said, the private companies are allowed to make an investment and are allowed to recover the investment over the useful life of the pipe. If the pipe is going to last 80 or 100 years, that's a pretty long time to recovering. And what we're learning is that all 100-year-old pipes don't age the same. Some were installed on top of limestone. Some were installed poorly. And as a result, those pipes are at greater risk of breaking, cracking. And if there is not some mechanism in place that will incent companies to go in and make investments on an accelerated basis, we could find ourselves in deep straits. I forget the number that the private water compaies -- miles of pipe they were replacing in a year. But once that this was passed in '97, that has tripled or quadrupled. 

[00:11:46]


>> I think it was 30 to begin with. One they passed the disc, it was like you can do 80 miles of pipe a year. 
>> Yes. If you looked at it originally, many companies were replacing their pipes over a 900-year cycle. You know the pipe's going to last 100 years. A 900-year cycle, you're asking for disaster. After the disc was passed, most of the private water companies like pennsylvania american water are replacing at about a 100-year cycle. About 1% per year. 
>> We have that. Some people might be saying, why don't you omething it hairs hair -- do something about harrisburg. It's not run -- it's not a company. 
>> I guess it should be stated here that the problems in harrisburg are not unique. We see water pipes breaking across the commonwealth, whether they're privately owned companies or municipally managed. It is more of a challenge for the municipal's utilities to do the kinds of things that we've done with the private companies because all we have to deal with is the water rate. We don't have to worry about the bond issues, the schools, and those things. We just have have to look at the impact that this new investment will have on existing water rates, gas rates, or electric rates. And we make that decision based upon that. The primary function of the commission is safe and reliable service from our private utilities. So when we put that at the highest requirement, it's easier for us to make a decision it accelerating investment in at-risk infrastructure. Even there it's a challenge. 
>> Well, let's take a look at the map we also have which i think the public works director has helped put together which pinpoints where the problems are in harrisburg. Those are the known sinkholes. And when you look at that and you realize harrisburg's financial situation, representative, people are going to look to the state for a solution once again. They need help in harrisburg. What are you looking for specifically? Is there a light at the end of this snunl. 

[00:14:11]


>> -- This tunnel? 
>> Well, we have to prioritize our sinkholes. We have the city public works department using the camera snake to go through and see which pipes are leaking the worst, to the most vulnerable to our residents. We'll try to prioritize that. Fixing that hole on north 4th street was about half a million dollars. If it's more preventive measures will be a lot cheaper obviously, and not disrupting everyone's lives. So we're going to get maybe the top five, ten worst places. And I'm going to be looking for the state. I mean, there's like hh20 grants, loans, we can tap into this. But this is an emergency situation, I feel, that can get worse. I'm looking at the transportation bill. I knows that's only roads, not infrastructure. But kind of combined a little bit. And with all the new revenue that hopefully we'll be getting for our bridges and roads, hopefully we can put some aside to tap into that funding because -- 
>> what sense did you get from other lawmakers? Did you talk -- I know the session just began. You just had -- were inaugurated this week. So it's kind of -- 
>> we haven't had a session day yet. So I haven't seen the rest. I know they'll be like, look, my town has this problem, my town has that problem, hopefully we can collaborate. 
>> I know representative kimn was on smart talk and somebody said this isn't a disaster, no one lost their lives. You made the point if someone goes without water and sewer for a week, it's a disaster. Do you sit back and go, whew, thank god that wasn't one of our pipes in one of our communities, or do you say, I feel for those municipalities, we've got to figure out ways to help them? 
>> I do feel for them, and I'm a strong advocate for pipe. The problem is it's underground. So many times when we talk infrastructure in pennsylvania, we think about roads and bridges. Something that people can see. So they think about it. No one thinks about pipe that's underground it's -- 

[00:16:26]


>> I do. 
>> It's out of sight. 
>> You're special. 
>> Really, it really is a problem that what we don't see we don't knowledge about. And it's easy to defer maintenance also on something you don't see. People see an unpainted water tank, they think, that should be painted. Or hydrants, those should be painted. No one drives along a roadway saying, I am so happy today that water is traversing through the pipes and going from the source of supply to my tap. I feel good today, or wastewater is moving away. People don't think about it. It's an issue not just for harrisburg, for all systems. We have to have people think about what they can't see. 
>> I know mayor thompson has been getting heat for this. When you look at it, the city receiver is talking about now taking $4 million out of the water and sewer fund to make payroll through march. And ultimately tax revenues stoort come in in april. His theory is we'll be able to pay back that fund. That's the very fund that would be paying for these repairs. You're in the cycle. This bill developed over 50 years, 75 years. Suddenly the problems are thrust upon you. But I think people want a sense, too, is there management to deal with this. And so how harrisburg going to get ahead of it. At this point, as kathy said, you've got to get ahead of it. And as you say, commissioner, I'm not surprised this sinkhole opened up. I'm surprised there aren't more opening up. 
>> Right. Right. I think the city of harrisburg is close to solving two of our big -- not selling, leasing rather, two of our biggest assets. We may be getting out of debt sooner rather than later. That's a relief, obviously. Because this happened -- which I'm glad no one was hurt, but I'm glad it happened because it WOKE USm=??5m!=4!=m=o=m=??<b=o=o!P<??<b=??<b=<764%=m=o==7[<+!h== 7===!z5j5 UP. I TH??5+=m==!INK THE +!h=o=o=o==!??<??<q67=m=+!b!h=o=ADMINISTRA Tion is going to be putting aside capital fund money so we can be more proactive. 
>> We have a phone caller from harrisburg. Patrick's joining us. Welcome to "smart talk." What's your question or comment tonight? 

[00:18:32]


>> Caller: Yes, my question is for everyone on the panel. And the question is, why was a state of emergency called for this situation? 
>> Okay. Patrick, thank you very much. I know I've heard that question before. Either a disaster declaration for the city or an emergency. Do you have insight into that? 
>> That's more of an administration question. 
>> It is. By the way, I should say we did invite someone from the administration, public works department, to come on. Bob sylvan said the mayor has a comprehensive review underw and she would prefer for the review to come in before commenting further. 
>> The situation was evolving. I think it sites why on new year's eve, everybody was out downtown. And when this came about, didn't really have a plan. And I think the residents were not happy with how the city dealt with it. But as -- as it got worse and worse, I think at one point we should have called it. But I think we some resources that we felt comfortable, red cross was awesome with us, pennsylvania american water was so supportive. We had water buffalos out. We felt we had it under control. 20/20, hindsight, we should have maybe declared it an emergency, yeah. 
>> Well, unfortunately you might be having to we'll do it again 
-- 
>> we'll be ready next time. 
>> Lessons were learned for cities based on what happened in february, 2011, in allentown with that horrible gas explosion. Five people were killed. A whole neighborhood was destroyed. That really prompted the puc to crack down. We ultimately passed a piece of legislation. Governor corbett signed it last february, act 11. What does that mandate now for gas companies, electric companies, and waste water treatment companies? 
>> Again, it provides the same incentives for the electric and natural gas and waste water companies that did not have these financial incentives to accelerate their infrastructure replacement. So this is not new expansion. It's not new investment. It is solely to increasehe rate that existing infrastructure has replaced. In pennsylvania, on the natural gas side, we have some 56,000 miles of -- 5,600 miles of natural gas main. A good portion of that is 80 to 100-year-old cast iron. It has seen -- most of it has seen better years. And we have deemed that to be and the industry has deemed that to be at risk. And where you find some of these cases, and I won't speak specifically it the allentown case, that is the pipe itself. Also, the geology because if the soil shifts, whatever of supporting that pipe has also shifted. And now you get the possibility of some movement which will accelerate any fatigue in the piping. You can have cracks whether they're hairline cracks or otherwise. 

[00:22:01]


>> Take a look again at the map that you put together, bill. We'll put that up. That shows the limestone, and you can see the concentration in the allentown area. I don't know if everyone remembers that, you can go on line and look it up. But that catastrophe of the explosion -- and then I believe there was one in california, a gas line explosion. You can see that this kind of infrastructure breakdown is catastrophic. It's horrific. I mean, it just incinerated that neighborhood. It's scary to think it we have these pipes out there. And it took until last year for us to pass legislation to modernize that. You're grimacing a bit. But that was the wake-up call. It's not the dump truck that the guy survived. It was five people dead. 
>> It's the wake-up call for the general population. The commission had been working with the legislature around drafting this language well in advance of the event in allentown and philadelphia. Because the wake-up call to the general population was such that, yes, we really do need to do something about this, we did have some -- some momentum to get the act passed. But we come in, and there's just a general recognition across all of the private utilities that the existing infrastructure needs to be replaced. 
>> And how does pennsylvania's geology, how should it affect how we construct those pipelines and projects? 
>> Well, speaking from the geological end of things, you can imagine like we've mentioned here that one you start moving soil and that support away from the utility lines, that can compromise, you know, any type 
-- and it's basically a water-driven system. So there are more -- they're more sensitive to exacerbating the whole situation than other types. You know, once a pipe starts to leak, it might start flushing out a nearby drain, you know, in our plumbing system type of scenario. And you know, over time, it just causes perhaps the pipes to become more disjointed. And it may not happen all at once, and that's part of the thing about sinkholes is that it may take a real, real long time for it to develop. But when it does happen, it can happen very fast and, you know, and typically in some cases very catastrophic failure can occur. 

[00:24:35]


>> That was some months after the allentown gas explosion, there was an event of where they had water main breaks that took out -- major sinkholes and just by an act of god, the gas main on the same road, the road where you had your sinkhole for the gas main fortunately was strong enough that it didn't crack after the ground was washed out from under it. 
>> Are you getting nervous? 
>> You know, I mean, we have some pipes made out of -- constructed with brick. I think it's double layered bricks that make a nice, round circle. And I automatic -- I'm impressed that they're still working today. You know, we really need to think about these things. I remember doing a story on the show where we had a pipe under the train tracks, and talk about having the movement every day. The pipes underneath, you know, how long are they going to stay up. So I think -- 
>> another 100 years. 
>> Another 100 years? I'm going to hold you on that. Having municipalities, have the self-discipline of storing away money for emergency funding for these kind of things because, you know, I -- I'm the squeaky wheel I feel like. It's not only harrisburg, you guys have all agreed with me, it's everywhere. Municipalities have to think about this and be more proactive. 
>> It is. We have an e-mail from tom who wrote that sinkholes in limestone areas, landslides, radon, et cetera, and the problems they cause will develop as often developers don't want to hear about geohazards in areas they want to develop. You might win a battle but mother nature will win the kathy pape, how does it work when they want to put in a development or commercial project of some sort and your company's the one that's going to provide the water? Do you go in with that frame of water, mother nature's going to win, so we've got to do this right? 

[00:26:36]


>> Well, you know, we regulate by the puc. We have a defined service area. If a developer want to put in a development and we will -- we'll put in the pipelines for them, but it's up to local planning and zoning to determine whether or not they can build in an area. If they tell them they can build, then we'll be asked to put water and wastewater into an area and will do it if it's in our service area. We might -- we might shore up the pipes differently. We might -- basically brace them in an area differently. But we don't have the right to say it's not within our authority to say, you know, really you shouldn't be building here. Maybe you should go two or three miles away, be a little better. It's like people build at the shore and then are surprised when houses wash into the water. 
>> Those of us who live on the west shore have had to deal with traffic issues on one of the main thoroughfares where you are replacing pipe. The numbers you gave me earlier this evening were astounding. Just in this area, right, you're spending $20 million -- 
>> just pipe. Replacement pipe, $20 million. That was in 2012. 
>> Okay. And then statewide, how much? 
>> Statewide, $250 million on pipe, tanks, pumps, and treatment plant repairs. That's annually. 
>> Okay. And so when you extrapolate what is going to be required for all of these other -- what confidence do you have that a municipal authority like harrisburg's or palmeira which is dealing in derry township with the same problem have the capability to deal with this? I mean, I guess taxing authority is the main thing they have at this point to put -- or bonding, go out for bond. But harrisburg can't get a bond, right? I mean, they're trying to borrow, they can't. 
>> Not to talk about rrisburg specifically, but it's really about foresight and planning. I'm not saying it's easy because there are private companies, as the commissioner knows, there are private companies that have difficulty if they don't preplan either. They end up with a problem with service, reliability. But it's about starting now. We have a bad situation now, but are we going to tolerate a bad situation for the next ten, 15, 20 years, or are we going to look at what assets are there, we going to determine what the condition and then plan for replacement. We have a choice now -- 

[00:29:00]


>> you said to me earlier, we're sort of -- if you look at this, this is a mountain. We're at the foothill here, and it's going to get worse. You disputed that on the phone and said it's not going to happen in pennsylvania. We're not going to have that sort of catastrophic thing. Why are you so confident about that? 
>> Because in ole at the commission and with my fellow commissioners, for the companies that we regulate, we're not going to tolerate it. We're going to see the investment in the replacement of the infrastructure. The tools are in place for our companies to take advantage of it, to make the ymt in the infrastructure. And if we start seeing a reduction in reliability, if we start seeing more catastrophic failures in the infrastructure, we will take action. 
>> Do you feel confident about that, too? 
>> Oh, I feel absolutely confident. I have no doubt in my mind. The epa schedule doesn't show catastrophic breaks, though. Shows when will the pipe that was installed after each of the world wars, when will it come to the end of its useful life. You have choices. You know when it will come to the end of its useful life. Will you replace it on a proactive basis, or will you wait and react when it breaks. I think what the commissioner's saying is he will insist, commissioners will insist that it's replaced on a systemic basis. We know exactly, you know, when the pipe will come to the end of its useful life. Will we address on an ongoing basis -- this is corporate governance right there. Hang on one second -- they want me to get this e-mail in. Jim writes and says -- tax the city population that uses that infrastructure. That's what taxes should be used for, these issues. Well, the residents of harrisburg, you could argue, are probably maximally taxed out at this point. But you have how many people in flow each day into the city to work, to shop, et cetera? How do you get something out of them? 

[00:31:02]


>> The governor, governor rendell put together a great sustainable infrastructure task force report back in 2008. And they -- he has a lot of great ideas and recommendations that I would like to see harrisburg use. 
>> What would you support in this regard? 
>> When it comes to funding, yes, we have to tax the user at the user rate, increase it a little bit. But have a combination of state and federal funding. We cannot do this alone. Let's look at regionalization. All those pipes are connected to each other. Why don't we make it a public/private entity or project where we have support, where we do it together. I think we can save money, too. Even sharing staff members to get these projects grant moneys. And be cooperative about it. Again, we're not alone. It could happen outside of harrisburg, as well. Why don't we cooperate and do it right, do-- do it smart. 
>> I know if they enacted the commuter tax, there's mixed feelings. Would you support that and earmark it for infrastructure? 
>> Commuter tax? I'm not convinced that a commuter tax will bring in the money that we expect. I think the other communities will increase their earned income tax which will leave us very little. And I think it would shrink the actual revenue, and it's not going to be the great idea that everyone, some people think it is. 
>> You were making some faces during that. Any -- 
>> no -- 
>> no? 
>> Kathy kind of inferred that we have -- we have also experienced bad experiences with our reguld utilities. On some occasions, we've had to take actions to have some companies taken over by more capable companies. And that may be an ultimate solution to some of the municipal problems as representative kimm says. Either there are some combinations of municipal utilities to give them economies of scale, give them greater value and power, or just have them just get out of the business and get a stronger entity in to operate the utilities. 

[00:33:18]


>> In fact, there was an e-mail to radio smart talk. Thomas from anaheim township wrote that saying, have they thought of an outright sale of a utility or lease to a utility like aqua america or american waterworks? I think he meant your company or is american waterworks a different one? I'm a shareholder in aqua america, in reading their annual report they have expanded by buying systems in cities that do not or cannot upgrade their sewer systems. Is that something you would think about with your company, taking over a city like harrisburg's water situation? 
>> We're certainly open to looking at it. From a public policy point of view, if you believe in the commonwealth and economic commonwealth of the region, you can't have situations where you have a problem with water and wastewater. So -- 
>> it hurts the image of the commonwealth of pennsylvania, doesn't it? 
>> Absolutely. I mean, everybody across the nation, probably internationally knows about what -- what happened last week with the sinkhole. We can't have that. So whether it's an outright sale of assets, whether it's a partnership, a lease, there's got to be a way -- if we really want to make a policy decision that this has to be addressed, there are a multitude of ways to get at it. But we have to be willing to say we can't have this. 
>> All right. I have to stop the conversation there. Thank you very much for joining us and sharing your expertise. 
>> Thank you. 
>> We really appreciate it. 
>>> Coming up in just a bit, we'll look at what's going on at the 2013 p.A. Farm show. Plus, how we averted the milk cliff and what the farm bill extension means for pvania farmers and consumers. 
>>> First, here's this week's news from around the capitol. The union representing workers at the pennsylvania lottery present their counteroffer to preserve public control of the lottery. Governor tom corbett wants to privatize it, and the sole bidder is a british firm, camelot global services. Camelot promises to generate $34 billion in lottery profits over the next 20 years to fund programs for seniors. It's backing the offer with $150 million in cash collateral, and a $50 million letter of credit. Instead, afscme council 13 says it can beat the guaranteed profit by 10% to 30%. Both plans rely on expanding the lottery with online games. Meanwhile, state treasurer rob McCORD TELLS THE CORBETT TEAM IF They expand lottery gaming without legislative approval he won't sign off on payments to a private firm. 2012 was a very good year for pennsylvania casinos. For the second year in a row, pennsylvania ranks second in total gaming revenue. Nevada is the only state to beat us. Pennsylvania casinos collected nearly 2.5 billion gaming dollars, and about 60% of that revenue went to state and local tax coffers. 

[00:36:10]


>>> State corrections officials say they will close two western state prisons -- greensburg and cressen. It will save $23 million this year. They'll transfer most of those prisoners to the state prison in center county. That cost nearly $200 million to build and has been vacant until now. 
>>> A voter of pennsylvanians support the governor's lawsuit against the ncaa over the state sanctions. The public policy polling survey? Of voters shows 52% support the lawsuit while 34% oppose it. The governor fares worse on popularity, just 38% of plus or minus 3.8%. 
>>> Pennsylvania barely passes when it comes to school reform. According to a new national report, students first, a school reform group headed by former d.C. Schools chief michelle rhee, gives p.A. A d-plus on 24 specific measures. They range from empowering parents, spending wisely, improving teachers, and school governance. Students first does praise pennsylvania for several programs including its new principal and teacher evaluation system. 
>>> To spur more growth in manufacturing jobs, the corbett administration lowers the interest rate on five key state business loan programs. Also, the pennsylvania industrial development authority and the department of community and economic development waived their fees to borrowers who apply by march 31. 
>>> Lend a hand, save a life. A campaign to teach pennsylvanians about sudden cardiac arrest. The american heart association, heart rescue project, and state department of health want to train hundreds of thousands of us in hands-only cardiopulmonary resuscitation. Hands-only cpr done by an immediate bystander doubles or even triples a patient's chance of survival. Three easy steps -- call 911, push hard and fast in the center of the chest, and use an automated external defibrillator if one's available. For more information, visit heart.Org/lendahandsavealife. That's some of the news around the capitol. 

[00:38:20]


>>> As most central pennsylvanians are well aware, the farm show's in town. Area hotels are packed, traffic'sbacked up for miles at times around the farm show complex. But if you haven't had a chance to explore this year's show, you better hurry. There only two days left to visit the 97th pennsylvania farm show. The butter sculpture, cow patty bingo, the great grape stomp, and the famous pennsylvania preferred food court delight visitors from all over the world as they celebrate agriculture made right here in pennsylvania. Let's take a look at what makes the farm show so irresistably pennsylvania. 
>> The sights, the smells, the pennsylvania farm show. It's a tradition nearly 100 years old, and it's the largest indoor agricultural event in the united stat. With 10,000 competitive exhibits and nearly 300 commercial exhibitors. 
>> It's a great, wonderful tradition. We expect over 400,000 people will visit the farm show this year. Seems to be growing in size this year. 
>> It's just -- an experience. And I can't get over the crowd today. This is the biggest crowd we've ever seen really. Tremendous. I had told my husband today, i said every fool in the state should bring their kids here. Especially the ones from the cities who don't get to see these things, you know, the animals and how they care for them and everything. 
>> What have you seen today, buddy? Anything? We just got here -- chickens? 
>> Cows. 
>> This is our learning center. It's geared for first time horse owners, children. It's an educational booth. We're here for these kids. We want to educate and to see their faces, it's phenomenal. Agriculture's the number-one industry in the state. Equine is the number two INDUSTRY WITHIN AGRICULTURE..k.kNhNh:k.k.iFhNhNh!K?? ?Nlv we'd starve if we didn't have agriculture. And the average child thinks milk comes in a mix bottle. They don't know it comes from the holstein or whatever. It's very good as an educational thing for the public who aren't familiar with different issues. 

[00:40:30]


>> I think it's so popular because it's such a family-focused experience. Initially the focus was on education, farmer to farmer, then switched over the years now to more of a consumer show. People can learn where their food comes from. 
>> I moved here in 1999. So it was like from -- if michigan. So fascinating. I heard so much about it -- i know people come from all around the world. I was like a little kid. I was grown, but I was like a little kid. I think all of this is fascinating, especially the food. 
>> Then of course there's the food component. A lot of people come for the food court. Some days I think all 400,000 of these people are in that milkshake line at one time. But the food court is very, very important. 
>> You were about to make the milkshake happen here. 
>> Waiting a year for ?4s< this. 
>> We've basically brought a lot of food. I like the milkshakes and like ice rutucream. 
>> The -- I was living to come down here it eat. That was the first thing we did. And the lines were tremendous. But I stuck it out, and I got them. They are so good. 
>> Pulled pork, chicken, french fries, doughnuts, milkshakes. What do you think about the food, puddy? Is it good? 
>> Yeah! 
>> The food is such a hit, nearly 14,000 milkshakes and over 250,000 potato doughnuts were gobbled up at last year's show alone. Beyond the food and farm animals, it's a celebration of pennsylvania's rich agricultural history and the important role it plays in american farming today. 
>> One out of seven jobs in pennsylvania is somehow related to the agriculture industry. People don't think of us as being such an agricultural state, but we really are. Today we entertained a group of about 15 people from the u.S. Department of agriculture. And they are surprised at how pennsylvania rank in terms of food production compared to other states. People think of us as philadelphia, pittsburgh, and harrisburg. There's a huge portion of the state that agriculture rural -- I can remember coming as a child with my parents and grandparents. That's still what happens today. It's a great event. We encourage all of the pennsylvania citizens to come see us. 

[00:42:51]


>> Great stuff. As farmers made preparations to head to harrisburg for the farm show, many anxiously waited for congress to app a new farm bill before the new year. Along with a fiscal cliff, farmers faced what many called a mix cliff. Without new legislation by january 1, milk prices reportedly could have doubled. Congress decided to punt. They passed an extension of the old farm bill. Without a clear and reliable future outlook, farmers are cautiously looking toward 2013 and beyond. We want to hear from you, especially if you're a farmer. What will the impact of an extension instead of a full five-year plan hayour productions? And if you like milk, what about the foods you eat and drink? Call us or e-mail us, smarttalk@witf.Org. Or post to witf's facebook page. Joining me is mark o'neill, media relations director for the pennsylvania farm bureau. We had hoped to have mark fulton, a dairy farmer near n cumberland county on the program. Unfortunately, one of his horses suffered an injury tonight. And he has to attend to the animal. And we wish them both well. This is just heartbreaking. He said his wife was really having difficulty with it because he fears they're going to have to put the horse down. Mark, this is just a part of a farmer's life. The day is never done, and they really come to care about those animals. 
>> They do. I think that's one thing that people in the public don't understand is how much farmers do care about their animals. And even the animals that they raise to eventually be butchered and made into food. They care about the animals, whether it's a dairy cow or steer or, you know, chicken, anything. They do care about the health of the animals. They want to provide them with, you know, the basics that they need. You know, clean water, nutritious food, proper arizona ventilation very important. They -- proper air ventilation very important. They also care about producing safe and healthy food for the fabconsume. And that's something I don't think we hear enough about. And maybe farmers don't talk about it enough themselves. When you have a chance, if you go to the farm show, this a great opportunity to talk to farmers or the 4h kids or kids wearing the blue jackets from ffa. They usually have pretty good stories to tell. 

[00:45:10]


>> Well, I'm sure they do. I know mark fulton whom, as i said, we wanted to have on the show tonight, he talked a little about his animals and said, "i just love them. You come to know them individually." He said cow vs. A personality. I know I -- cows is a personality. I know I wrote that earlier and ben on our crew was laughing about it. A cow's personality. I guess if you know the animals, they have their good days and bad days. The days they have good days and want to go to the milking station and bad days where they want to stay on the field. 
>> I've been on dairy farms where they give the)?? cows a name. I don't know how they do it when they have a 250-cow herd. Some know their names and say they know how much they've produced over the years. Again, it comes down to animal care and well-being. If you treat your animals well, they treat you well. They're much more productive whether it's producing milk or whether they grow large enough and when they go to -- to slaughter, they produce more food and you make more money that way. 
>> All right. Let's talk about this milk cliff. Now, you dispute the fact that if they had not passed an extension and failed to pass a brand new farm bill which was ultimately what farmers wanted that we would not have faced a mix cliff. That milk would not have gone as high as perhaps $7 or $8 a gallon. Why do you say that was the media inflating the potential for that risk? 
>> It wasn't just the media. There other others, as well. By technicality, yes, that could have happened. Would have dropped back to farm policies from 1949. But the reality is it wasn't going to happen automatically. The u.S. Department of agent secretary would have had to have rain policies in place. You would have had to take steps to make that happen. I don't think there's a politician out there no matter what party wanted to step forward and say they were reble for doubling what you pay for a gallon of milk. So it wasn't automatic. There were steps that would have to be taken, and the reality was there was going to be some form of an extension. How long the extension, that was under question. Was it going to be a month, was it going to be two months, it was going to be a year? It ended up being a year which is nine months. The end of september it will run out again if action is not taken. 

[00:47:23]


>> The other thing I thought was funny, when I was talking about you coming on the program, we said we want to talk about milk pricing. How milk -- why does a gallon of milk now cost almost $4. You said we're not going to talk it the price of milk, it's complicated, hard to explain. Can you give a basic primer in how the price of milk is determined and who plays into the decision, the characters? 
>> Let's put it this way -- the federal government plays a role in the price of milk, setting the minimum price for milk. There's something called -- 
>> why is that? What's the philosophy behind government price support? The idea that government -- 
>> this isn't support. 
>> It isn't support -- 
>> setting a price. 
>> Okay. Go ahead. 
>> I think what it comes down to is in the day, and this is still considered today, milk is a staple. They wanted to make sure that milk, which is important for health, human bones and everything and youth, they wanted to make sure that it would be affordable for everyone. And that is the concept that has stayed through yacht time, over the past 80 years. So the -- the sporter basically sets a bin mum price for milk, but it's based on trading of t . . Rt and it gets more complicated. Supply and demand still play a factor in this. One of the biggest factors that makes milk prices shift deals 
-- with exports. A lot of countries want milk products from the united states or corn from the united states or want other trade, agricultural trade products from the united states. That also can impact prices. Droughts in australia a couple of years ago and new zealand called a massive increase in dairy state in the u.S. Because they needed what we had. In pennsylvania we have the milk marketing board which has another layer which affects prices. So I'm sure iffin's still watching the show now -- 

[00:49:27]


>> heather -- 
>> maybe they've learned something. 
>> I know earlier, tim lambert, the all things considered host here, he said to me, whenever we get the price releases about milk coming out of the department of agriculture, it has things and we go how do we put this in plain speak. We have a call now from rick who's calling from newtown. Welcome to "smart talk" this evening. What's your question or comment? 
>> Caller: Just a short comment. Let them put the milk prices whatever they want. We don't have to buy it. Keep the government out of everything, including the milk. 
>> A libertarian. Get the government out of everything. What if they let the market determine the price and what customers are willing to buy? 
>> I think a lot of dairy farmers would like that. What that would mean is they would be more competitive and would eventually make more money. I think part of the reason maybe why the government -- this is my opinion. There is concern that if we let the market rule, the price will go up a lot. And then regular people may have difficulty purchasing milk which is still considered a very important part of children growing up and having availability of milk. But a lot of dairy farmers seem to believe that if they did that, it potentially would mean more revenue for them. It's really complicated. And you can get ten dairy farmers in a room and talk about milk and the future of milk. You might get ten different opinions there, as well. The thing I will say is a lot of farmers say it's about the margins. It's not about the price of milk. It's really about what it is, it dofts produce the milk -- it costs to produce the milk and the expenses. Determines, a, whether they're profitable, whether they can stay afloat. And that's something that is looked into and is addressed and is something that they're concerned about. 
>> I know the "patriot news" had interviewed a dairy farmer. He said it's not how much you make or spend, it's what you get to keep when it comes to farm prices. So let's talk about the bill that most farmers drew consensus around. It managed to pass the senate, and I think even the house appropriations committee. It didn't get any further than that before the end of the year. What would it have done? 

[00:51:43]


>> Those two bills were also different. They also included different dairy parts, as well. Agai adding to the complexity. 
>> Yeah, what's the senate -- 
>> that actually tried to address some of the margins in the dairy price. And what they wanted to deal with is take a average in of the price that farmers get for milk versus the average in of feed costs, and then the differential between that if it's $4 per 100 weight, which means 100 pounds of milk which is how milk it s actually sold. Then if it would dip below that, there would be revenue that would go to the dairy farmer. It's also a vary program. Dairy -- voluntary program. Dairy farmers would have the option of getting in it or not getting in it. That is one that has probably more popularity than some of the other dairy proposals out there from national milk and many other dairy producers. 
>> Mark fulton who was going come on the show tonight, said he's a third generation farmer. Talk a little about that. The family tradition, is that still very prevalent here in pennsylvania? Do you have brand new entrepreneurs who say I'm going to run a farm today and buy out a family farm? Or-- is that pretty much not something that happens in pennsylvania? 
>> Certainly we have generations coming back on the farm. What we have is fewer of. It families aren't as big as they used to be. There are many more options for farm kids. A lot of them go to college and have other options. Some of them choose to come back to the family farm. But whether they do that, remember when you add someone back on the farm, they get married, bring in another family. You need to generate more income now because now you're not talking about one family, you're talking about two families. And that's sometimes where you see expansion of operations or diversification. Whether they get into adding a chicken operation or some of them do agri-tainment activities or many other options. The bottom line is -- 

[00:53:44]


>> agri-tainment? I love that. That's some kind of entertainment, whether you build a maze like a corn maze -- 
>> some places do much more than that. Yes, corn mazes, they can do that. Some of the -- farmers market, corn mazes, pumpkin patches. You know, pick your own apples, pick your own strawberries. Many of these operations you see more and more of, and it's good for the public. This isn't just about farmers. The public wants to get out on the farm. They also want to see how their food is grown, did they like to buy local when they can. And we think it is something, the most important thing is connecting farmersnd consumers, their customers, together again. There's been this disconnect. Sometimes that disconnect creates issues that don't really exist, misinformation. 
>> What you've been talking, i know heather and our team have been showing great shots from the pennsylvania farm show. And I have to say, I have a 13-year-old daughter -- she came back from the farm show, and I'd never seen her that enthused since she got her phone. It put on a performance just looking at them. And the idea of the personal connection, people are able to make -- maybe the only time they do so is at the farm show themselves to where this food mes from that we eat every day. Being able to see the animals that actually produced this, whether it's the dairy cows, the pigs, et cetera. Talk about the importance of the farm show to the continuing tradition of agriculture in the commonwealth of pennsylvania. 
>> Well, in order for the tradition to continue, farmers need to stay in business. And the farm show is a great effort where we have the public, people who are not used to being on the farm, come in. They can learn about farming. If they're able to do that, when it's time maybe for public policy or thing in which farmers need stay aoat, there would be backing from the pub. I have to give a plug for the today's agriculture display. If you have the opportunity, see it. It's how animals reerl on the farm. Great exhibit. 

[00:55:50]


>> Get there before saturday. Thank you very much for coming in tonight. 
>>> That has to be our last word. But the conversation on the farm bill continues tomorrow morning on radio smart talk. Join scott lamar for a special remote broadcast live from the pennsylvania farm show from 9:00 to 10:00 a.M. On witf 89.5 and 93.3.

[Captioning made possible in part by the f.M. Kirby foundation] captioned by the national captioning institute 
--www.Ncicap.Org-- 
>> this time on "state of the 
>> this time, on "state of the arts," a visit to the studio of renowned artist philip pearlstein. Coming up next on "state of the arts." 
>> The new jersey state council on the arts is proud to coproduce "state of the arts." Additional support is provided by the geraldine r. Dodge. Foundation. 
>> Philip pearlstein is an american master, a painter's painter. 
>> Every painter becomes a new experience. 
>> He is a figure w he is really a figure who has extraordinary depth within the art world. He has done something very well for a long time. He w be 85 in the spring. He is making the best paintings of his life. Iit is rare that an artist continues to make his work all the way through. That is what is happening in g's case. I realize in getting to know him and thinking about his work, there is a part of his work that is the best known. The work dealing with the female and male figures in close in claustrophobic interiors surrounded by many of the objects in his own creation. Is the most radical of on the realistic objectives he has taken on as a painter. He has also made wonderful portrait. He also made wonderful landscapes. As I began to do research on his work, those were themes he began at the beginning of history -- creativity. 

[00:02:27]


>> In high school, pearlstein competition in 1941. Won the 1941 national arts competition. 
>> They of my ranp full-color reproductions of my paintings along with other people in the show who won prizes. That was the beginning of my art career. Unfortunately, the army drafted me a couple of years later. 
>> He spent world war ii in the infantry in italy where he continued to sketch. After the war, he finished college, went to new york, and found work as a graphic designer. All along, he continued to paint. 
>> I began paintingimpressionist very expressionistically, as would paint at every artist was doing. I would pay at home every night from 10:30 p.M. Until 1:00 a.M. 
>> This went on ars. Along the way, he got a master's in art -- art history, starting a family, and started to teach. He started his life work -- his life's work, painting the new model. It was a radical idea at the time. He has been doing it ever since. 
>> A lot of people thought he started at a and ended atyears b. I have seen it evolve since the mid-1960's. I have seen all that stuff come in. I have seen how he has complicated his compositions to a degree that is almost unfathomable. 
>> Because they it have the figure in it and because we are people, we identify with the scale of the painting. The paintings of nudes are always just enough with the than life. I cannot have a small hands. My hands next to her hand will be much smaller. They are just enough bigger that they over power. You have this incrediblee feeling of power. As he has gottenis paintings older, he has made his paintings more complex. They have to stay interesting to him. 

[00:05:03]


>> Landscapes, portraits. For philip pearlstein pearlstein, they are problems to be solved. 
>> Portraiture is an design problem. You are interesting design problem. You are stuck with that basic shape, the oval of the head and how to make it interesting. to of the face, how to get it to work in the rectangle of the painting regardless of who the sitter is. It is like concentrating on the individual features as if they were rock formations. I do not try to analyze the people. A great deal seems to come through. I guess it is some kind of body language that is beyond years later when I see some of these anybody's control. Years later, when I see some of these paintings, I am starr told by how much -- startled by how much of the personality seems to be there. Ve>> he captures something essentialha of the person. The person has never been live at as carefully and as long by other human being as they have been by him. 
>> The way he blew my head up in the middle of the portrait was kind of unusual. I challenged him by putting on a shirt that made him work extra hard. I had to give him a little secret challenge. 
>> The models have to havesympathy some sympathy for what I am after and be patient and not care about whether I am flattering them or insulting them. 

[00:07:08]


>> It is funny. I have never gotten over seeing a painting of me hanging up. You are just kind of stunned by how good he is. You see it constantly and you know it and you read about it. But to see it happen and to see it completely done and hanging up -- you are kind of starstruck by him every time it happens. The way I feel immediately is, i am really nude. You would think after being an artist and doing it for so long and studying nudes, that would not be your reaction. You are also conscious of the reactions of others. There are critics who do like his work or do not like his work. What are your friends and family going to think? It never ends. You just have to be secure in the works. The most I get out of it is the fascination of how he gets every line, every hair, every fiber in the carpet. 
>> He sets up a challenge. The challenge is called a complex still life. He has added a whole new degree of complexity by including the figure. He has taken this briefing body and put them and missed the increasing number of objects that he has chosen to depict as a really profound challenge. 
>> When he finds something and it is being shipped, we are all standing there waiting for this thing to show up. He loved mickey mouse. He takes it out and plug it in and it is like a christmas tree lit up because it is n. Eon. Ihe is standing there like a 5- year-old kid. I was thinking how funny he is to be his age and get this joy out of the simple things in life and how I want to be that way when I am his age. 

[00:09:23]


>> He is reticent and retiring in his approach to people. When you start to engage that in conversation, you know there is a mind turning their every minute. You can go in every direction possible. His threat of knowledge about the history of -- breadth of knowledge about the history of art is striking. 
>> No matter what, you can find him painting at his weekend house in new jersey. 
>> Of people today, I am working on a portrait of people who live across the street. They are not part of the art world. I like them so much. They are like people I grew up with. I did not grow up in the art world. 
>> I think people sense he really respects the shipment figgie. 
-- Human figfureally - figure. He shows the human figure -- >>i think people sense that he really respects the human thing here. 
-- Figure. 
>> One of my earlysomething like teachers was malcolm green. Someone asked him why he kept painting. His answer was, I want to see what it looks like when it is finished. That is ultimately the answer. ?????? 

[00:11:25]


>>> this is my first opera. It was also dave's first opera. I have never written anything anywhere near this long. Each act is 65 minutes. 
>> He has a ph.D. In composition from princeton university, where he studied from one of america's great modernist composers. He has written music for bands, orchestra, chorus, all kinds of instrumental combinations. Never before now an entire opera. 
>> You have to find different languages for the characters. It is not like you write a play and that is an opera. A play and an opera are two different things. 
>> He has a ph.D. In literature from nyu and has written and published poetry throughout his career. 
>> We lived across the street from each other for 30 years. We have never done any work together. He is a terrific poet. 
>> The two lived in new jersey, the wpa-era town that became an artistic mecca in the late 1930's. 
>> He calls it a garage opera. 
>> I was puttering around my garage and he comes over. He says, I want to write an opera. Do you think you can write to me a libretto. I said, I have never done this before. I have heard operasi was never an over time, but I was never an overall fan of it. Initially, what I thought we would do to get warmed up was adapt and existing one-act play, chekov's "marriage story that has been proposal." He said he wanted to work on a story that had fascinated him since he was a kid. 

[00:13:43]


>> In sunday school, I remember being taken with david, this fairy tale. In the to kid goes out and beats this giant. That stuck with me. I love that. They were hard edge. They were w craggy. There were things that were shocking that you did not hear in sunday school. Killing ainstance. Husband so that he could have bathsheba. 
>> The keen -- is only necessary love as if to kill the fear within. King pursues himself in david. 
>> I was brought up a up jewish. Jewish and dave was brought up an evangelical christian. We met in the middle. I knew the outline of the biblical story, but not a lot of the complications of it. He gave me a lot of the books that interested him. I read them and became fascinated by them. 
>> I realized what really helped me as an adult was this triangle of david and saul andthen you the transition of power. Then you have the personnel discovery. It is like discovering your story. When you discover your story, you discover who you are. 
>> It was davidit coming in to discover was david coming into discovering what his real story is. Was he the hero that goes out and vanquisheso the giants'? Or is he the one who comes into political- that goes out and vanquishes the giant? Or is he the one who comes into political power by making nations -- mecha -- by as intriecausepower. 

[00:16:09]


>> I was intrigued because it gave me the opportunity to design music that is best the essential natures of these characters. You ve saul is a king by who is a king by chance. He is a warrior. He is disturbed. ?????? you have davd, -- david, talented whom everything up untilcu now has been a breeze. He is extremely talented. He has to grow. ?????? 
>> you have jonathan, who loves his father and loves david. He is torn. ?????? 
>> there would be with them study with detect and overlays that you cannot do with uage. You cannot have a character talking and another character talking over the top of them. In music, you can do that because we all harmonize. He said, why don't we bring this back here. You can bring them in a special way, but this particular word is clear. Sthis word over here is not as clear. It does not have to be because it is repeated at another register. That was fantastic. That was a completely different way of lookinglanguage. ?????? 

[00:18:42]


>> now after five years of after five years ofwo work, rutgers university's school of the arts has produced concert versions of both acts of the opera. What is next? 
>> We hope we can get it fully staged and fully produced. 
>> There strongi'm very glad audience for opera. Opera t composers are talented people and we are grateful to have joined them. 
>> What I really lovebout collaboration is that the process alone has been just fantastic. I w never would have imagined. >> the work of michael rees actual and the virtual world. Exists in the actual and the virtual world. His art is shown internationally from chelsea to china. He creates his chelsea's -- his creations. Mentally on a computer. Then there is the rapid prototyping. >>Ly it is my fault that people probably it is my fault that people refer to me as the technology person. For me, think of technology technology is a asphilosophy or a point of view. Digital media has an iredibly elaborate philosophy. I am fascinated by it. Omi am comfortable being referred to as the sculptor that does the digital media stuff. I am attracted to the digital media. How do weal handle all love this stuff? This isd example. A pretty good example. I am playing around with this. This has those two sculptors' you see in the animation. When you look -- to sculptures not real time. It is recorded like a film. You see in the animation. It is spring recorded and played. This is from a three dean -- 3-d c.A.D. Program. It is the same thing they do in hollywood for "ironman" and assembled "batman." That is the technology. It is not unlike anybody to make model kits, airplanes and things like that. We have a block and all of the parts are in a block. We break the things away and start assembling them. It is something I deeply enjoy. . 

[00:22:13]


>> Work exists somewhere his workbe is as somewhere between the studio and the lot 
-- the laptop -- exists somewhere between the studio and the laptop. Thethere is this series. 
>> It is the spins various and skulls. It is the sixth chakras chakra. Has to do with imagination and daydreaming and all the things that artists have constantly in play. Within it are my little meditations and musings about this particular state or pl 
>> then there is the series known as the monsters. If you look at thehese animations i make, they are not a horror film. On one level you are attracted and repulsed. They are really funny. A lot of times people break out into laughter the first time they see these funny monsters. The various people have had different responses. One person said, that is not right. Another person who is a stockbroker on wall street said, that is my life. He thought he was looking at his life. On first glance, monsters they look like monsters that are multi-limbed night mayors. But you begin -- nightmares. Then you begin to see all of these other things. 

[00:24:15]


>> This is a program he has been developing for years. 
>> You will see that the act of typing creates a form. It is a simple thing. The letters are matched to objects. The act of typing makes a form. In this case, we have an alphabet that is a pipe alphabet. As a demonstration, we can create a different alphabet. Let's do helvetica. You will see that the letters show up as letters. People can make all different types of alphabets. I have been working on this a long time. It is a little bit of a sketch. 
>> Speaking greater than michael rees about art is like this into a physicist talking about the shape of the universe. It feels comfortable to a science experiment. Maybe it is just that his unusual approach strikes one as being futuristic. I had to ask, where is it all go when? What is the future of art? 
-- Thati had to ask, where is it all going? 
>> I have a foot in the new world. Where is place. Our headed? It is headed all over the place. People are going to do everything. People are going to cut the best come up that have never done play doh. They did not play with monopoly. They played with smis. We are going to crea -- they played with sims. ?????? ??????

I'm howard curts. If you misse us go to itunes on monday, search for reliable sources in the itunes store. Join us next weekend for cnn's special coverage of the presidential inauguration. "State of the union" with candy crowley begins right now. 
>>> The white house forces the issue even signaling it will go it alone on gun control where it can. Today the biden panel rea its report for a white house that's banking on public revulsion. 
>> There is nothing that has gone to the heart of the matter more than the visual image of little 6-year-old kids riddled 
-- not shot with a stray bullet -- riddled, riddled with bullet holes. 
>> Conversations with nra president david keene, and connecticut senator chris murphy. Then the dying art of bipartisanship with west virginia demoic senator joe manchin and former republican presidential candidate jon huntsman. Plus, guns, spending and all the president's men and we do mean men, with republican congresswoman marcia blackburn, democratic congressman elijah cummings, "the new york times" jeff zeleny. And jeff scherer. I'm candy crowley. This is "state of the union." 
>>> A month after the massacre in newton, connecticut, the vice president is expected to present an array of gun control proposals this week. # he has publicly mentioned universal background checks on gun buyers and restrictions on high capacity magazines. The white house adds that president will also push congress for an assault weapons ban, a spokesman explained biden did not mention the controversial ban because the panel focused on consensus proposal it appears you can count the national rifle association out of that conken sus. For starters, biden talked about his conclusions before he met with the nra and after the biden session the gun rights lobby said, quote, we were disappointed with how little this meeting had to do with keeping our children safe and how much ihad to do with an agenda to attack the second amendment. Joining me now is nra president david keene. 

[00:02:12]


>> How are you? 
>> Very glad to see you. Thanks for coming. Let's set the bottom line here. In that meeting, was anything said by the vice president that you could agree with in terms of a proposal and was anything said by you that he could agree with? 
>> Well, he'd have to speak to that. We sent jim baker the former director of our institute for legislative action to the meeting because he knows most of the people, he's been involved in this for a long time, and we went to the meeting on the assumption and as the vice president and had his spokes people had said several times, they enter this without any conyou collusions having been reached -- as you pointed out conclusions were reached. We suspect he wanted to say he talked to us and they were going to go forward with doing what they wanted to do. We made the point there are things that could be done. One of the things that we have pushed for, for a number of years is those adjudicated to be mentally incompetent and potentially dangerous on to the lists of those people prevented from buying firearms. That has not been done. That should be done, because most of the people who engage in these things are people who have had real trouble. For example, some years ago, the virginia tech shooter, would not have been able to purchase a firearm had that been done in virginia. We hope that the administration will get behind that kind of proposal. 
>> It appears they possibly are, in fact, doing that. But the question here is, that there have been -- we know the nra, for instance, fought in one of the states that was trying to put, you know, to say look, folks who have had -- mentally ill may not have guns, and you wanted to make sure they had a right to go back and -- 
>> correct. 
>> -- You know, say I'm okay now. Even though you talk about it, it seems that a lot of people, you put the brakes on things like that. 
>> Well, what we put the brakes on is anything that simply takes away a person's second amendment right for no good reason. You can restrict the constitutional right, like free speech, famously you cannot yell "fire" in a crowded theater, and what we have suggested and this has particularly come up because this administration and a previous one have attempted to bar returning veterans who have sought psychological help from buying firearms and we said fine if there is an adjudication this 

[00:04:34]


-- that they shouldn't be doing this, but if that happens and they get better and after the whole point of a mental health system is not to permanently relegate people to an inferior status, but to cure them. If they are cured, there ought to be a way out of that. That's all we've said. We think that's very fair. 
>> Insofar as the things we have seen out there, universal background checks in assault weapons ban, and something that contains these clips, makes them so that you can't have the large capacity, that is just a nonstarter for you. 
>> We don't think any of those things work. 
>> So the art of compromise in washington is for somebody to give something up, and for the other people to give something up. What are you willing to put on the table? 
>> Well, you should absolutely be willing to compromise on things that accomplish the purpose. Our objection to those things is that they interfere with people's rights without doing anything to solve the problem. If you are going to solve the problem, there are two things that you have to do. You have to get to the root of the problem, and in virtually all of these cases, it is a mental health problem and we have a mental health system that has collapsed and secondly you have to provide security because you can't always find somebody who is about to do something. We are not experts on mental health and we are not experts on security, though we've set up independently somebody who is to look into that, but we do know a little bit about guns and firearms and what works and what doesn't work. We are not willing to compromise on people's rights when there is no evidence that doing so is going to accomplish the purpose. 
>> No assault weapons ban and no ban on these multi clips. I don't think the white house is going to budge on their point. You're note going to budge on your pushback. Let's talk about the politics of this. Do you think you have enough support on capitol hill to keep an assault weapons ban from passing? 
>> I think right now we do. 
>> As opposed to -- 
>> candy, you've been watching capitol hill for a long time, and when a president takes all of the power of the office if he is willing to expend the political capital, you don't want to make predictions and you don't want to bet your house on the outcome. I would say the likelihood is that they are not going to be able to get an assault weapons ban through this congress. 

[00:06:51]


>> How about a clip? Some kind of a restriction? 
>> I don't think that ultimately they will get that either, because I don't think you can make a case, a, that you can reallyegulate it because these things cost virtually nothing, you know, even david gregory could find one, but the fact is that we're -- we live in a society where first of all, we have constitutional rights and secondly, there are millions upon millions of americans who value the rights that they have under the second amendment and who are involved in the shooting sports or use firearms for self-defense and we think that they will be heard. 
>> And when you look at the power, one of the things that you said when you came in is that our number one political priority is to defeat the president for a second term, and that didn't happen. You also lost some high profile senate races that you invested in. What does that say about the power -- because there are a lot of people out there who say, look, this has changed, that newtown has changed public sentiment, and it has changed the mood on capitol hill, and yet you think that the nra still has the power to block this? 
>> The nra doesn't have the power, but those american s who believe in the second amendment do. The races that were decided this year, weren't decided on the second amendment issues as you well know and not discussed. The president said he would never take your rifle, your sidearm or interfere with your second amendment rights. In those races where there was a clear choice -- let me give you an example. We were very involved in the wisconsin gubernatorial recall, because you had a clear opponent of the second amendment and propont of the second amendment we made a six-point difference, I should say gun owners made a six-point difference. In that race we did exit polls and everybody that voted said they supported the goals and principles of the nra. I'm willing to suggest that gun owners in this country have as much influence as they always have and perhaps more because guns are more acceptable now than they were ten years ago. 

[00:08:51]


>> One of the big questions here has been, who does the nra represent? You do take millions of colors from people who make guns and who make bullets, all perfectly legal, I'm sure they're all fine folks. 
>> Actually, candy, we get less money from the industry we would like to get. 
>> But you get millions of dollars from them. 
>> We -- so the criticism out there that the nra and some other gun supporter groups gin up this, that they are going to come take your guns away, because what happens is that the gun sales rise and people go out, and you know, sort of frighten people into thinking that the guns are going away when, in fact, even membersers that are shortly friendly to you, all who a-ratings say we have to look at the assault weapons ban and the accusation is that you are ginning up this conversation, because it helps gun sales. 
>> The two people selling so-called assault rifles are senator finestein and president obama and not us. They're the ones that are scaring american gun owners. It isn't the nra. But we do say, one of our core missions, you know, the nra has been around since 1871 and from THE 1970s ON, WE HAVE EMERGED AS The defender of second amendment rights. That's a core part of our mission. 
>> Sure. But is that -- in that do you support gun owners or gun manufacturers? 
>> We support gun owners, our members and the people in the country who believe in the second amendment. We have had our difference s in the past, if you know the history of the nra with the gun manufacturers, because it is not our constituency. Our constituency is twofold, the american people who want to own guns and use them legally, and it is the second amendment, itself. 
>> David keene, president of the nra, thank you for joining us this morning. 
>> Any time. 
>> Coming up, while washington debates gun control, connecticut's governor pays tribute to the fallen. 
>> In the midst of one of the worst days in our history, we also saw the best of our state. Teachers and therapist who sacrificed their lives protecting students, a principal and school psychologist that ran into harm's way.

Newtown, connecticut, has done what no other shooting has, prompted what may be decisive changes to gun laws. Joining me now is connecticut senator chris murphy. Senator, you are in newton today. I appreciate you taking the time. Let me get a quick update from you, if I can, about what we know. It has been a month. Are we any closer to understanding what motivated this shooter? 

[00:14:33]


>> This is an ongoing investigation and I think that it has been very difficult for the police to find out the motive here. This guy did a pretty good job of destroying a lot of the evidence, and his computer which he may have done a lot of gaming and correspondence on was ruined by the time they got to the house, and although we expect there will be a report and the families desperate want as much information as we can get, we haven't gotten much yet. This community is still really grieving. This is certainly about the families of the little boys and girls who are lost, but it is also about teachers and administrators and first responders who maybe in the fury of the days and the wes after the shooting didn't exactly understand how deeply it had affected them. This is going to take a long time even after the report comes out for this community to recover. 
>> Right. And the other thing that is still outstanding there, is there any evidence that the shooter sought mental assistance or that his mother sought it for him? Was he ever in the system in any way? Well that's one of the questions we're trying to answer. There have been reports that the mother understood this was a deeply troubled individual and she was at or around the time of the shooting trying to find some serious treatment option for him. The fact is, she would have run into the roadblocks that thousands of mothers and fathers run into all across this country. There are a lot of kids who need help and the waiting lines for mental health services are very, very long. Clearly she knew there w something wrong here and trying to figure it out, but there might not have been an option for her given the lack of funding for a lot of the services. 
>> So that turns me to what is happening in washington now, because newtown, you are right, it is going to take so much time to heal, and in washington now taking up the kind of other end of this, what can be done to prevent this, a legislative look? We are hearing a lot about gun control and I know you heard the interview that we did with david keene, the head of the nra and is there anything that he said that you said, okay, we can find some common ground and by the way, you get an f are the 

[00:16:46]


-- from the nra. So you're not in sync with them. But is there commonalty that you heard that's helpself in. 
>> Well listen, if they want to work on funding for mental health services let's go to work on it. What they proposed a national registry of everyone in this country who's mentally ill. You want to talk about an abridgement of the bill of rights talk about what that would mean for people who have been diagnosed with depression who would find themselves on a list. The fact is that the nshg ra does not represent gun owners anymore. This is not your father's nra. It represents gun manufacturers. Less than half of their funding comes from their members and they make tens of millions of dollars off of the purchases of guns. What your guest didn't tell you is that every time -- not every time but when assault weapons and high capacity magazines are bought in this country, often the nra gets a cut of those sales through its roundup program where the purchase price is rounded up to the nearest dollar and the nra gets the difference. The nra makes money and pay their salaries off the gun purchases. That's who they're representing in this debate. 
>> Let me ask you, I know senator feinstein and bloomenle that are about to introduce a ban on assault weapons. What do you know about that piece of legislation? 
>> I'm going to be a supporter of that piece of gislation. 
>> What's in it? 
>> This is a -- this is -- i think will be a ban on assault weapons moving forward that's a tighter ban than the previous ban, and it will address high capacity magazine clips. The fact is as soon as we pass THAT BAN BACK IN THE 1990s, THE Gun manufacturers found a way around it and other states like new jersey and california have passed much stricter bans and that's what the congress needs to do. I get it. The nra is going to use all their resources to try to stop this thing, but ultimately, the people of th country have been transformed and these assault weapons, and they know it, these are not used by sportsmen. You don't need an assault weapon to kill a deer or do target practice. Sportsmen will not have their rights abridged or their ability to enjoy their sport change by having these dangerous military-style assault weapons taken off the streets. 

[00:19:02]


>> So let me ask you a bit back on the mental health issue. Does it concern you that when we are hearing things from the biden panel, we are not hearing a lot about improving mental health services so that women like the mother of the shooter could maybe find some help, and we're not hearing a lot about these videos that seem to have some sort of effect, at least on those whose minds are already a little warped, so are you concerned that this is going to become only a gun control issue? 
>> I definitely want to hear us talk about mental health, because, you know, we know we're coming into lean budget times and there's always a tendency and risk to go after those line items that support mental health services first in these debate. I want that to be on the table. But let's be honest, we are not always going to be able to find these individuals who on a dime turn into mad men, and what could have helped here in newtown is a ban on assault weapons. I have to tell you that i fundamentally believe that if we had a ban on assault weapons and a ban on high capacity clips, this guy might never have taken up arms to begin with. What happens is these guys start to get courageous when they believe they can walk into a school or movie theater with the kind of weapons they see in these video games. There would still be little boys and girls alive in newtown, today, I believe if you had banned assault weapons and high capacity magazine clips. That's something we can do and do now.

>>> For a moment, as the new congress gavelled in, everybody got a whiff of bipartisanship. 
>> I present the people's gavel to the speaker of the house john boehner. 
>> But now is the long winter of our political discontent. Raising the debt ceiling, preventing sequestration, and funding the federal government for 2013 and passing gun regulations or not, and tackling immigration. The to-do list for congress looks more like the new years's resolutions you won't get around to. 
>> Republicans in congress brought this house to a new low last night. 
>> The senate proceeded like a bull in a china closet. 
>> They are like salespeople who tell their customer they can have the $30,000 car but only pay $18,000 for it. 
>> Now, a number of politicians, current and former, have joined forces to create a partisan-free environment, and called "no labels" they are pledged to a simple proposition, stop fighting and start fixing. We'll discuss compromise and the chances for success with the no labels chairman, democratic senator joe manchin of west virginia and former republican governor of utah jon huntsman, next. She wants.

Take beano before and there'll be no gas. 

[00:27:31]


>>> With me now, senator joe manchin, democrat from west virginia and former presidential candidate and former utah governor jon huntsman, thank you both for being here, joining forces here. I have to say when I was reading about this, and said, okay, goals to argue less and act more, and I'm thinking, yeah, but how do you go about that, particularly from the outside? Why is an outside group needed? 
>> Well, let me say from no labels' standpoint when I was a senator two years ago, I was enamored with this because i came from a governorship -- jon and I were freshmen governors in 2004, we got elected in our states of utah and west virginia and we became friends, democrat and republican, looking to solve problems. I thought the same would carry over when I got to washington. First of all you have to understand the dynamics of what we're dealing with. As a senator we have -- since I've been there in two years, there has not been a bipartisan caucus where we sit down to talk with our republican colleagues on the other side, unless we do it behind what you see on the day-to-day basis. Even tut taking it further, we don't even know our colleagues in congress, the 435. So, this gives a us chance, and no labels gives us a venue to sit down and have meaningful conversation. 
>> But, you know, to have to do this seems like, you could tell 100 grown men and women, you guys need to talk to each other. 
>> Right. But did you hear what joe just said? I mean can you believe there's not even a venue that allows people to come together to solve problems? The premise is a simple one. Joe and I come from a background of problem solving as governors and when you see the dysfunction of congress is now becoming our nation's dysfunction, we're becoming disfigured in a sense, our economy is, because congress is so far behind in the game, so the premise is a simple one, and that is that we want to create a new attitude around problem solving. How do you do that? 
>> Right. 
>> You've got to get a critical mass together of problem solvers which is what we're doing, we have 25 signed on and our goal by the end of the year is to have 75. So if you can imagine 75 republicans and democrats house and senate members who agree to meet, check their ego at the door and sit around a table where they're putting their country first as opposed to party, as opposed to the next election, they're thinking about the future when they deliberate about these important issues, that's the objective. So far as I can tell, candy, I'm a recent convert to this, they came to me most recently, there's nobody else in the world of movements now that is focused on bringing people together around the premise of problem solving. 

[00:30:11]


>> Well, certainly, there have been third way, and a lot of the groups out there that have sort of tried this, but it is in reality, you get, you know, bipartisanship on capitol hill tends to be, if you agree with me, then you are being bipartisan. So let me try to get you to apply bipartisanship to gun control. I think we can pretty much see where the lines of delineation are here. You heard the nra, you hear those in -- some moderates and those on the left going, no, wait a second, it can't be about guns. It's about the society, it's about mental health. So you these two sides that to me sound a lot like, you know, ten years ago when they were arguing this. 
>> Candy, you two former governors that were raised in cultures of guns. 
>> West virginia and utah. 
>> I've been an nra member, a-rated, always been supported and appreciate all the support i receive. I appreciate all my friends in the sporting arenas and hunting and all that. I was taught at a young age use it safely, respect the firearms and make sure I passed it down to my children and grandchildren. With all it that being said, never in my life could I imagine that I would see a time where mass violence has escalated to the point where 20 children, let's say 20 babies, in their kindergarten were slaughtered. That has changed. 
>> That's how everyone felt. 
>> For any -- 
>> and everybody went holy cow. 
>> And this has changed, and we owe it to sit down and talk, but it has to be comprehensive and it can't be about guns and guns only. It can't be about the mental illness or the lack of mental illness care we have and the video violence and the media. I want every nra member and every law-abiding gun owner to know that the second amendment rights will not be infringed upon and the same as the first amendment will not be infringed upon, but as adults we have a responsibility to have an adult dialog and try to have a comprehensive package that works. 

[00:32:17]


>> We have dialogue about the deficit and we have simpson bowles which everyone promptly ignored. It's kind of going back into the conversation now, but the question is, and I know you've written an op-ed, you know, what's reasonable? What is reasonable in terms of gun control when it comes to states that understand the gun culture and how deeply it is embedded in the culture of some of these states? 
>> Well it's going to have to be a little bit from all of the above and that's why, you know, your show -- 
>> assault weapons ban. 
>> We've heard from the special interest groups, we're hearing from, you know, one end of the spectrum or that end of the spectrum, but in the end, our duly elected officials get together with an op mind and they then make decisions on behalf of the people they represent. That's where getting back to no labels is so important. You know, we've got the politics of right and left and center, but we've forgotten the most important part of all and that's the politics of problem solving. Representing the people in all that we do. What we are doing today is not normal and for the younger generation growing up seeing the way that politics is playing out this is not the norm. That is why joe and I coming from the backgrounds we do, you get people of right and left together in a room, whether it's on guns or anything else, and you say, what's the pathway forward? How do we solve this for the american people? 
>> What is? You've called for reasonable. What's reasonable to you? Is an assault weapons ban such as the one we're about it to get from dianne feinstein and senator blumenthal from connecticut, is that reasonable? 
>> First of all, how do you keep the guns such as assault guns out of the hands of mentally deranged people that should have help? That's where it seems to be. If you look back at the virginia tech, the gentleman had been detained twice, only for 48 hours because of the laws we may have. 
>> Didn't apply in arizona because he apparently hadn't sought anything. Colorado. 
>> But that's a huge problem. The other part of it is, what type of weapons, how registration, how they're getting into the hands. All of that is reasonable to talk about. There's a premise now in washington that guilt by conversation. Used to be guilt by association. We've moved on to guilt by conversation. We can't even sit down and have conversations about can you talk about any of these issues, whether it's the clips and whether it's registration and whether it's bans on certain military, you can't even talk about it and if you don't have the people who are understanding that, the people that basically have expertise in that, at the table and if you keep pushing the nra away, they've got to sit down and they've got to have a responsible place at the table and I've kept -- I'm pushing that. I want them to be there. But I want the people that understand mental illness, that understand the video games. 

[00:35:05]


>> So the wholistic approach. 
>> Here's why. What joe is saying is so important and why the no labels dimension is so relevant here. Regardless of whether it's guns or whether tax reform or immigration or energy policy, it's all the same. 
>> Right. 
>> They're going to have to come to the table with a comprehensive package. In the case of guns you know the throw or four components that haven to included in the end. It's kind of a no-brainer for most but we have a hard time getting there. That's why bringing together these -- this coalition of problem solvers in congress that no labels has been able to, it's a start. By the end of the year if we get 75 to 80 such people, imagine the progress on all these important issues we'll be able to make. 
>> I'm going to give you the last word here. You are in a position, you do vote in the senate, and your words post newtown were taken originally as, oh, senator manchin is now for a ban on assault weapons. Probably what you were talking about. 
>> Guilt by conversation. 
>> So the question here is, am i correct in interpreting what you're saying, sure you would talk about an assault weapons ban, but it has to be in a more wholistic package than just here's an assault weapons ban, that is right? 
>> No labels and problem solvers and be a member her of that, doesn't cost a thing, no labels.Org, sign on. It brings people together. I can talk about, I want to know -- I don't own an assault weapon. I own guns. I don't have the multiclips. I need to talk to people that believe it's important for them to keepmulticlips. I need to talk to people that go to gun shows don't believe they need to register. I want to hear from them. Why is it so important you're protecting that position. On the other hand, they're saying how come you're not looking at the mental illness and the people causing the mass violence. How come you're not looking at the video games that my 8-year-old can log into and see and glorify violence and it really is an all-inclusive approach. It's building a consensus and you have to take it that way. 

[00:37:07]


>> If I can get a yes or no, possibly. An assault weapons stand alone ban -- 
>> assault weapons standalone ban on just guns alone will not in the political reality that we have today, will not go anywhere. It has to be comprehensive. That's what I've tried to tell the vice president and I've told everybody, it has to be a comprehensive approach. 
>> Senator joe manchin and former governor jon huntsman, thank you both. Good luck. We'll have you back and see how many you're collecting as you go along. Thank you. 
>> Thank you. 
>> Up next, our political panel on guns and presidential nominations. pad, she can't always move the way she wants. Now you can with new stayfree ultra thins.

>>> Joining me around the table, "time" magazine's michael scherer, and elijah cummings, democrat from maryland and congresswoman marsha blackburn and also from "the new york times" jeff zeleny. Happy new year. Thanks for being here. Let's talk about guns. Do you sense -- I want to look at it from the inside out and outside in. Do you sense that the steam for a ban on assault weapons is slowly coming out of the balloon? It just feels a little bit like both sides have reverted to form. What does it feel like? 
>> Well, you know, I had suffered a death of my nephew at handgun violence and with the assault weapons, I think we have a possibility, but I think it's going to be very difficult. I think the things we do agree on, it seems is the universal background checks and the high capacity magazines. 97% of republicans say that we ought to have the universal background checks. Your own poll, cnn's poll, and then 61% said we ought to look at high magazine capacity. I think that those are the things that we will be able to get done but I think we ought to try to approach it from a comprehensive standpoint and get as much done as we can. 
>> And senator manchin mentioned that as well. Because he said the only way to deal with guns is to deal with the rest of it. Do you sense among your colleagues and in fact, quite a few democrats with high ratings from the national rifle association who come from gun country where gun is not a dirty word and all that, and do you sense that this is kind of fading away or is there still a real drive for some kind of limitations on guns or the ammunition? 
>> You know, what I am hearing is that people want to make certain that we protect the second amendment and their second amendment rights and protect their freedom and not impede that. Also, I'm hearing from a lot of teachers and mental health professionals and physicians that we need to do a couple things. Number one is to drill down on the mental health issue and number two is to look at these psychiatric and psycho tropic drugs, because that is, many times, linked to the individuals that carry out these crimes. They're also wanting to make certain that we begin to get in behind these video games. I have -- I watched a couple of these last night in preparation for this segment, and candy, as a mother and a grandmother, i was astounded with some of the things I was seeing on "call to duty" and, of course, we know the norway shooter would go in and use that as target practice. I mean, this is something where you say, number one, let's keep children say, number two, let's protect our freedoms and let's put these our freedoms and let's put these issues on the table and have a good solid conversation about it. 

[00:44:23]


>> Where is this going? 
>> I think that the white house is still interested in a perfect world for an assault weapons ban, but there is a lot of evidence out there that, a, it did not necessarily work last time, but they are more interested in getting something accomplished, so we will see that as part of the vice president's proposal, but it is not going to be the be all, end all. And if that does not happen, it is not going to bring down the whole effort. I think that the president is committed to this, and I think 
-- 
>> and by this? 
>> Some type of background checks, probably ammunition clips. There's going to be another shooting sadly. This is going to a stay in the consciousness. I don't think this is going to recede sort of into our memory here. 
>> But the problem is, you know, it could be a hammer, a hatchet, a car, a gun -- 
>> but hammers and hatchets and cars are not asast as the clips. 
>> But you still have to look at the mental health and make certain that you are protecting an individual's rights. 
>> And to the point quickly, 30,000 people die as a result of handguns in this country, and 10,000 homicides, but the vast majority of them, candy, are suicides. 
>> Right. And a lot of the mass shootings are sujcides as well, if that makes sense, and people say, no, they go with the intent of dying doing this, so it's part of a suicide. How do you see it panning out? 
>> Well, we will have proposals next week, and it will include everything that is being talked about from the vice president. You have a house right now that can't pass the speaker's bills. The senate will probably react later this year and then it's a long-term process about figuring out whether you can continue the outside pressure, the outrage from the country. I think there's common ground on background checks, a dispute over whether it's universal or just gun shows. There's not going to be common ground over magazines initially, but there's room to move there because a lot of these shootings, there's evidence that reloading clips in the case of gabby giffords, it was clear when he tried to reload the clip is when he was taken down, and it does matter. It does reduce the number of people that can be killed. Improving the backgrou system. The nra is less on board with. They will have to wrangle with the details. And then the reach at this point. 

[00:46:41]


>> When you look at it, one of the things I thought that senator manchin said that was interesting was, unless you put this all together in a single bill it's not going to pass. You can't just go here's the assault weapons bill. It's got to be part of a package to show -- the president said of the biden panel we have to lack at mental health and these videos. 
>> I think we may start with a package, but I think that with the way the congress has been divided, I think it's going to be hard to get a total package through. This may have to, candy, be a project and not [ inaudible ]. We may have to do it piece by piece. I would rather see a cpre henesive bill. One thing is for sure, if we don't act now with 20 young kids being murdered, I don't know when we're going to act. 
>> Exactly. Will you stick with me, because when we come back the president makes some cabinet picks for the second term. We'll be right back with our package. WE WILL BE RIGHT BACK WITH THE enience TDD#: 1-800-345-2550

>>> we are back with michael scherer and jeff zeleny of "the new york times" and marsha blackburn and congressman elijah cummings. Switching gears. A lot made about the president's latest picks in the cabinet, jack lew, senator hagel, senator kerry in key positions here, treasury, defense, state department. Something your colleague, congressman wrangle said about the lack of diversity in the cabinet thus far. It's embarrassing as hell, his words. We've been through all of this with 2012 gop presidential nominee, mitt romney. And we were very hard with mitt romney with the women binder and a variety of things. And I kind of think there's no excuse with the second term. There was a white house cabinet picture, a photo that went out, and it was kind of astonishing in its white male variety. First of all, does it matter? 
>> It does matter. I think women are very, very, it's very important that we have women in the cabinet. It's important that we have women in the congress. I would hate to imagine the congress without women, to be frank with you. I think it's a little bit early, candy. I really do. He has the epa position to fill governor solis. At labor and commerce he has to fill. I think if we just wait maybe a week or two, I can almost promise you we won't even having this discussion. 
>> No offense, but as you know, state defense treasury. Those are the crown jewels of the cabinet, are they not? 
>> The president passed over a very well qualified woman, michelle, who was kind of the next in the cue, if you will, for defense and went with chuck hagel. I know, I've got friends that are for him and against him. But, candy, the thing is, there was a woman who would have been the best person for the job. And why did he step over her? It would have been a historic choice. I think there are a lot of people who are disappointed in that. 
>> We have a president that's not interested in diversity. You know, I'm not sure we can make that case, can we? 43% of the folks we have now of women. He does believe in diversity. 

[00:51:48]


>> Two supreme court justices. 
>> I mean, in his cabinet he had five women, four african-americans, three hispanics and two asian americans. That's diversity. I really believe that this president believes in diversity. That's why I say, I think it's a little bit early. 
>> I tnk this whole conversation is a symbolic way of talking about a deeper issue. Which is that it remains more difficult for women to rise to the top and it's worse in politics, ihink, than in academia or corporate america where women have made more gains. Ten years I've been here, I have yet to cover a campaign or a white house or even congressional offices where there are not complaints from the women about the sort of boys club atmosphere, with the exception of the offices run by women. I think that's really the deeper issue we're tryin to get at. Cabinet picks are important, but a broader problem in washington. 
>> I agree with that. With what michael is saying somewhat. That there is having enough women in the process is a bipartisan problem. 
>> Yes. 
>> Many times women are the most qualified, but they're not a part of the good old boys club. It is more difficult to make that, to have those open doors. And that's one of the reasons that the dod pick, whichould have been historic, is very disappointing and I do think people are going to be watching very closely to see if the steps this president takes are going to be the same type steps that he took in that first term. I think there's an accountability there. 
>> I think this problem in the short term is going to get worse for the white house because the chief of staff pick could come this week. LIKELY TO BE dennis McDonough or ron klain. But it is sort of interesting. I'm not sure I heard anyone on the hill praising the choice, potential choice of susan rice for secretary of state as a woman. I mean, they were criticizing her for her positions and other things. I think at the end of the day, it's optically not good. You know, obviously, for this president. He has sort of a strong record, but probably more important are those people around him. That white house photograph was very real and that's how it is on a day-to-day basis. With a couple of exceptions. But that's how senator obama and president obama has sort of always been. Always surrounded by usually men. 

[00:54:03]


>> Congressman, last word. This is also true of people of color. The president, obviously, we have a holder at the justice department. We have kirk at the u.S. Trade rep, but are there enough minorities and should it matter to us? Should we be discussing this? 
>> It should matter because diversity must be our promise and not our problem. And, you know, when you have first man of color in the white house, it becomes even more significant. But I believe the president truly believes in diversity and I think that, again, I think we'll see the diy coming down the pipe. 
>> Congressman elijah cummings, congresswoman marcia black burn, jeffrey zeleny and michael scherer, thank you for joining us. 
>> Thank you. 
>> When we return, strike up the band. The inauguration is a week away. YOU CAN BUY YOUR MEMENTOS NOW. endorsed by Weight Watchers And your taste buds have always endorsed us. So, you know what this means... this is a real win win! Yoplait, it is so good. 

[00:58:30]


>>> Finally today on the east side of capitol hill, rehearsals are under way for president obama's inauguration parade a week from tomorrow. But closer to the white house the party has already begun. ???????????? 
>> thousands and thousands of americans will make their way into d.C. Over the next couple of weeks. 
>> With a marching band and cameo appearance from the 16th president, the official inauguration pop-up store opened for business this week. Because what's an inauguration without t-shirts, teddy bears and hat s and tube socks. Not just any tube socks, mind you. Official tube socks. Obama supporters can also pick up a medallion coin set for $7,500. 
>> A small piece of history that you can keep. 
>> For the budget conscious inauguration reveler. 
>> Buttons. People are buying buttons. 
>> My merchandise, my buttons. 
>> Everybody wants these buttons today. 
>> For just $2.50 a pop. Barack buttons, biden buttons and if you're doing it up big, bo buttons. 
>> I think my favorite one has to be this one. It's the old one from the first family. I like this one. 
>> Congratulations, mr. President. 
>> Fewer people are expected for the second obama inaugural than the million plus who showed up for fths irs and fewer activities as well, but a

NARRATOR: As the daughter of one of South Carolina's first families, Angelina Grimk?? lived in almost unimaginable luxury. In the 1820s, Charleston's aristocracy was one of the wealthiest societies on earth, but Angelina found it almost unbearable, an empire of sin. 
CAROL BERKIN: The story goes that each of them in the family had their own personal slave behind them when they ate dinner. And if the salt and pepper were next to the person sitting next to you, you didn't ask them to pass it. Your slave got it from his slave and gave it to you. There was nothing that you had to do that there wasn't a slave who took care of it for you. Did you hear last night? Hear what? Really? Angelina, what are you talking about? You know! Henry! He whipped John again! 
I told you before, dear: That's henry's business. 
BERKIN: Angelina attacked slavery not in the beginning because she cared about the slaves. It is Henry's business. 
BERKIN: She was really concerned about the fate of their white masters. I asked you to leave him alone. He's my brother! Yes, I know. 
BERKIN: She believed slavery was a sin and that Godould punish people who had slaves. Mother, it is my duty to bear testimony against... Angelina, mind your own business. It is my business, and it's your business too! How can you stand in church every week... You must let it be... I can't let it be! Have you no Christian feelings? Yes, Angelina, I have Christian feelings, and you are putting them to the test right now. My soul will be judged by the Lord, and not by you or anyone else. It is my duty... It is not your duty, Angelina! I am glad, I suppose, that you are so diligent about your faith. But leave my soul to me and Henry's to Henry. I speak the truth in love. Enough! Mother! Mother! Mother, listen to me! Mother! 

[00:05:52]


JULIE ROY JEFFREY: Angelina's religious search was tortured, tortured, tortured. She was more or less on her own as she struggled with very deep and troubling issues about herself and her relationship to God. 
NARRATOR: In the fall of 1829, Grimk?? resolved to leave Charleston and the "pollutions of slavery" for an uncertain future in the North. 
LOIS BROWN: There's a kind of fearlessness about Angelina Grimk??. Women did not strike out, whitewomen did not strike out on their own in this way, and Southernwhite women certainly did not. This is disobedience to proper society, to the South, to the church. 
(birds chirping) 
NARRATOR: Frederick Douglass was alone in a terrifying new world. A few weeks earlier, the six year old had been delivered to his master's home on Maryland's eastern shore to begin his life as a slave. 
(loud banging) 
(dog barking) His first experience of slavery would haunt him to his grave. 
(woman screaming) 
FREDERICK DOUGLASS: Aunt Hester went out one night and happened to be absent when the master desired her presence. 

[00:07:58]


(screaming) 
(yelling) 
(crying) Bitch! Oh please, please... 
(crying) 
FREDERICK DOUGLASS: No words, no tears, no prayers seemed to move his iron heart. The louder she screamed, the harder he whipped; and where the blood ran fastest, there he whipped longest. 
(screaming) He would whip to make her scream and whip to make her hush. 
(grunting) I dared not venture out till long after it was over. It was the bloodstained gate, the entrance to the hell of slavery. 
NARRATOR: Frederick Douglass and Angelina Grimk?? lived at opposite poles of one of the largest slave societies in history. In the late 1820s, there were two million men, women, and children living in bondage in the United States. In the 50 years since the Revolution, every northern state had outlawed slavery. It had once seemed likely that it would disappear in the South as well, but no more. The invention of the cotton gin had led to a massive increase in cotton production, making slavery indispensable to both the South and the North. 
MANISHA SINHA: It's actually quite astounding how deeply entrenched it was in the nation's political and economic life. What is seen as this sort of idiosyncratic peculiar Southern institution actually had an enormous economic significance in the national economy of the United States. 

[00:10:07]


DAVID BLIGHT: Slaves were the single largest financial asset in the entire American economy, worth more than all manufacturing, all railroad, steamship lines, and other transportation systems put together. The only thing in the American economy worth more as simply a financial asset was the land itself, and no one really quite knows how to value North America. 
NARRATOR: The only voices advocating the abolition of slavery were black. Their frustration was growing, and some of them were becoming more militant, but no one in power was listening. As of yet, no white Americans could imagine turning millions of dollars worth of slaves into millions of black compatriots. But scattered around the country, a few lonely souls were convinced that slavery was a crime against God and man. And in Boston, one of them was coming to understand that God intended he do something about it. William Lloyd Garrison felt that he was destined to do great things, but he had no idea how to get there. In 1828, he was 22 years old, newly arrived in the city from his hometown of Newburyport. Garrison's father, a seaman and a drunk, had abandoned the family when Garrison was two years old. Plunged into poverty, Garrison's mother left her children for years on end as she looked for work. But in their time together, she managed to drum a fierce Christian conscience into her son. 
JAMES BREWER STEWART: William Lloyd Garrison's religious background was not just a background, it was at the core of who he was. It was an indwelling spirit inside of him that constantly thought about making God's will come into being on this earth. 

[00:12:19]


NARRATOR: Shortly after arriving in Boston, Garrison happened to meet an itinerant publisher who was raising money for his one-man anti-slavery newspaper. Garrison was horrified by descriptions of the slave pens where men, women, and children were held awaiting shipment further South. And he began to think that ending slavery was the cause that could give meaning to his life. In the summer of 1829, Garrison moved to Baltimore to take a job at the publisher's newspaper. He brought new life to the struggling operation, which had long been urging slaveholders to free their slaves so that they could be shipped back to Africa, leaving the United States a single-race country. But as Garrison came into contact with Baltimore's large free black population, he began to embrace a far more radical vision of America's future. 
(choir singing) ?????? To mansions in the skies ?????? ?????? I bid farewell to every fear and wipe my weeping eyes ?????? ?????? Should earth against my soul engage... ?????? 
STEWART: Garrison went to Baltimore and there boarded with free blacks. Had to share the table with them. Had to break bread with them. Had to sleep in the same quarters with them. And suddenly he had an idea that he had a much-expanded mission that did not simply speak to the question of slavery but spoke to the question of race. 
CHOIR: ?????? ... and face a frowning world ?????? ?????? Let cares like a wild deluge come... ?????? 

[00:14:24]


NARRATOR: Garrison lost interest in gradual emancipation. He wanted immediate abolition-- the complete eradication of the institution everywhere and forever. He even envisioned a future in which black Americans could share in their country's promise of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. Garrison was making powerful enemies; within months, he was thrown in prison for vilifying a slave trader. A New York sympathizer bailed him out in the spring of 1830. He had no job to return to. Neither did he have a home or a family. He had few friends or allies. He did, however, have a plan: a newspaper of his own to promote immediate abolition. 
WILLIAM LLOYD GARRISON: I am willing to be persecuted, imprisoned and bound for advocating African rights, and I should deserve to be a slave myself if I shrunk from that duty or danger. 
NARRATOR: By the fall of 1830, William Lloyd Garrison was back in Boston, doggedly pursuing his dream of an abolitionist newspaper. He scrounged around for printing supplies and convinced a colleague to loan him a few reams of paper. He traveled around the Northeast gathering a handful of allies among white reformers, but not enough to support his venture. 
JEFFREY: Garrison meets with a group of black abolitionists, and he receives very positive support. In that first year, the financial help of black Bostonians was absolutely critical. He had many more black supporters than white supporters. 

[00:16:28]


BROWN: He uses his time in African American communities in churches, in meetings, to think very deliberately about how to organize his own abolitionist campaign. There is a true partnership that can go forward. There's a kind of work that Garrison can do precisely because he is a white man in American in the 1830s. 
NARRATOR: On January 1st, 1831, Garrison's long-awaited day arrived. On the first page of the first issue of his newspaper, Garrison declared, "There shall be no neutrals; men shall either like or dislike me." 
WILLIAM LLOYD GARRISON: Let Southern oppressors tremble. Let their Northern apologists tremble. Let all the enemies of the persecuted blacks tremble. On the subject of slavery, I do not wish to write with moderation. I am in earnest. I will not equivocate. I will not excuse. I wi not retreat a single inch. AndI will be heard. 
NARRATOR: For eight months, rrison toiled away in almost complete obscurity. 
(horse hooves clunking) Then an explosion of violence halfway across the country suddenly propelled him to national prominence. 
(woman screaming) On a hot August night in 1831, a band of armed slaves rode through the Virginia countryside, killing the white occupants of one farmhouse after another. Nat Turner, the man who led the rebellion, would elude a massive search party for 68 days before he, too, was caught and executed. 

[00:18:35]


STEWART: The sudden explosion of black anger, black wrath, is so jarring that the ramifications of the Rebellion go far beyond Virginia. There's no evidence that Garrison's Liberator had any influence on Nat Turner. But very quickly in the Southern press, Garrison's name started to be associated with Nat Turner's revolt. The South Carolina legislature put a bounty on Garrison's head: $15,000 if you deliver his body, I think more if you delivered the whole man alive. 
NARRATOR: Garrison welcomed the notoriety. 
WILLIAM LLOYD GARRISON: The Liberatoris causing extraordinary agitation among whites in the slave states. I am constantly receiving anonymous letters filled with abominable and bloody sentiments. These trouble me less than the wind. I was never so happy and confident as I am at the present time. 
NARRATOR: Over the next two years, Garrison gradually won adherents to the anti-slavery cause. Almost 50 abolitionist groups formed in ten states. Their influence extended from urban centers like Philadelphia and New York to remote settlements like Cincinnati, a boomtown on the Western frontier. There, Lyman Beecher, one of the one of the country's most famous preachers, had recently moved his family. Beecher opposed slavery in principle, but distrusted activists who "recklessly" advocated immediate abolitio His 22-year-old daughter Harriet had inherited his views. There is "a class of professed abolitionists in Cincinnati," she wrote, but they are "unfashionable" and are "regarded as a species of moral mono-maniacs." Ladies. 

[00:20:52]


(giggling) He wants to be noticed. Don't they all? 
NARRATOR: In the spring of 1833, Harriet and two friends crossed over the river into neighboring Kentucky. She had never before visited a slave state. We have this fine specimen here, what'll you give? 25? $50, we've got $50 going once! $50 going twice! $50, sold to the gentleman here. How are you gentlemen doing this nice warm Kentucky day? Want to keep this thing going? No! No, my baby! 
R. BLAKESLEE GILPIN: What Stowe sees there is a human thing. She sees these people, I mean, they are human beings. 
AUCTIONEER: What will you give for this women? Man:25. 
GILPIN: She's confronted with it in such an intimate way. And I think that never leaves her. 
NARRATOR: In 1833, two years after William Lloyd Garrison launched The Liberator, abolitionists from all over the North gathered for the first time. They could feel the strength of their growing numbers: the time had come to unify their far-flung groups into one national anti-slavery society. Garrison was chosen to draw up the organization's charter. He worked through the night, producing a radical document that crystallized his own beliefs, especially his faith in the power of nonviolence. 
WILLIAM LLOYD GARRISON: Our measures shall be the opposition of moral purity to moral corruption, the destruction of error by the potency of truth, the overthrow of prejudice by the power of love, and the abolition of slavery by the spirit of repentance. 

[00:23:01]


NARRATOR: The American Anti-Slavery Society came to life the next day, when 63 people signed Garrison's manifesto. They vowed to spread the anti-slavery gospel to every city, town, and village. And they agreed to use what they called "moral suasion" to convert slaveholders to the cause. 
BLIGHT: The heart of the evangelical Christian's worldview was this idea that the individual can be converted almost immediately, so why not the society too? 
STEWART: They had seen through their own religious culture the conversion of people from the condition of being a sinner to being sanctified. And so the original intention of the abolitionists was to tell the slaveholders to repent and that they would. Abolitionists never waver in their faith or their hope that any day, any moment, slavery can end. 
NARRATOR: Word of the abolitionists' efforts spread, even reaching the slave Frederick Douglass. Douglass had spent much of his youth as a house slave in Baltimore. There, his horizons had widened; he had lived among free blacks, had secretly learned to read, and there he had come to hope that slavery might not be eternal. 
FREDERICK DOUGLASS: Every once in a while, I could hear my master speaking angrily about "abolitionists." I had no idea who or what these were. I soon found, however, that they were soundly hated by slaveholders. I realized with deep satisfaction that I was not alone in abhorring slavery. 

[00:25:24]


ERICA ARMSTRONG DUNBAR: This thought makes him question, it makes him hopeful, it makes him angry. So that when there is a need for Douglass to be beaten back into submission, to erase the experiences of Baltimore, he's sent to Covey for this. 
NARRATOR: Edward Covey was a farmer back on Maryland's eastern shore who traded on his reputation as a slave breaker. 
STAUFFER: He was truly sadistic. 
(yelling in pain) He whipped Douglass mercilessly at least once a week for the first six months for no reason at all. Come on, boy. Come on, boy. 
(grunting) 
(groaning) 
(panting) 
(coughing) 
DUNBAR: Douglass knew that by physically assaulting a white man, his life was in danger. But he's made this decision that it matters not. And he isn't punished in part because Douglass standing up to Covey ruins, or at least jeopardizes, Covey's reputation. 
NARRATOR: Covey never laid a hand on Douglass again. 

[00:27:26]


FREDERICK DOUGLASS: I was a changed being after that fight. I was nothing before; I was a man now. 
NARRATOR: By 1835, two years after the formation of the American Anti-Slavery Society, there were over 300 chapters throughout the free states, with tens of thousands of members. Garrison and New York businessman Lewis Tappan hoped to build on this momentum with a bold plan to directly confront Southern slaveholders and their supporters. They proposed printing 20,000 to 50,000 pamphlets a week and mailing them to ministers, politicians, and newspaper editors in each state, especially in the South. The postal campaign became a phenomenon. Within a year, the Anti-Slavery Society had flooded the nation with over a million pieces of abolitionist literature, along with medals, emblems, bandannas, chocolate wrappers, songs, and readers for small children. 
(shouting) The great postal campaign did not bring about the end of what Southerners called "our peculiar institution." Instead, it triggered a wave of repression throughout the slave states. In Charleston, 3,000 people destroyed anti-slavery materials, and then burned Garrison in effigy. 
BROWN: Southerners decide, "We're being attacked "and you need to bring these scoundrels to justice. They must be kidnapped, they must be assassinated." I mean, it's incredible uproar. This is when the South sort of closes itself completely on the issue of slavery. Earlier on, you were not putting your life into danger if you criticized slavery. But by that time in the South, if you did, you were taking a serious risk. 

[00:29:45]


NARRATOR: The vehemence of the reaction in the South took the abolitionists by surprise. But they were even more alarmed when the violence moved north. In some cases, abolitionists themselves were the targets, as when a New York mob burned Lewis Tappan's house to the ground. But all too often, African Americans were the victims of racist violence, from isolated beatings to the expulsion of entire black communities. The mobs shattered every abolitionist assumption: that righteousness would triumph over evil, that their fellow Americans would listen to reason, that their Northern neighbors would support the abolitionist cause. Garrison was stunned. 
WILLIAM LLOYD GARRISON: When we first unfurled the banner of The Liberator, we did not anticipate that to protect Southern slavery, the free states would voluntarily trample underfoot all law, order and government. 
NARRATOR: Garrison and his fellow abolitionists had roused an enemy far more tenacious, entrenched and violent than they had ever imagined. 
NARRATOR: In the years since Angelina Grimk?? left her home in Charleston, she had moved to Philadelphia and joined her like-minded sister, Sarah. There, Angelina discreetly followed reports of the abolitionist movement. She was reluctant to get involved, fearing that would bring disgrace to her mother back in Charleston. But as she read reports of the rising tide of pro-slavery violence, Grimk?? finally decided that she could remain silent no more. 

[00:32:01]


ANGELINA GRIMKE: Respected Friend: I n hardly express the deep and solemn interest with which I have viewed the violent proceedings of the last few weeks. "The ground upon which you stand is holy ground: "never, never surrender it. "It is my deep, solemn, deliberate conviction "that this is a cause worth dying for. Angelina Grimk??." William, she's the daughter of one of the most famous families in South Carolina. 
MCDANIEL: When Garrison receives Angelina Grimk??'s letter, he sees a Southern woman who is confirming everything that the abolitionists have been saying about slavery's evils. It's a godsend. 
NARRATOR: Garrison's publication of the letter horrified Angelina's friends and even her sister Sarah. They pleaded with her to renounce it, but Grimk?? refused. Instead, she committed herself to the cause. She had a weapon that no other abolitionist could claim: a pedigree among the slaveholding astocracy. Grimk?? set about writing an appeal to the women of the South, urging them to work for the downfall of slavery. 
ANGELINA GRIMKE: I know you do not make the laws, but I also know that you are the wives and mothers, sisters and daughters of tho who do. Let the Christian women of the South arise, and salvation is certain. 
NARRATOR: Grimk??'s appeal met the same reception as Garrison's pamphlets. In Charleston, copies were publicly burned, and the mayor warned her mother that if Angelina ever dared visit Charleston again, she would be thrown in jail. But Grimk?? had no intention of returning to the South. She had made up her mind to take up the banner of abolition. I'm going to lose my job... You're not going to lose nothing, understand? I got this figured out. Hey, hey, hey, who's this? What the hell is going in there? Just relax. You back off of me. Don't you mess with me, boy. 

[00:34:38]


NARRATOR: By the fall of 1835, anti-abolitionist violence was closing in on Boston. A stone-throwing crowd had recently forced one of Garrison's allies to abandon a speech. Garrison himself woke one morning to find a gallows on his front lawn. He ignored the warnings. On the morning of October 21, 1835, he made his way across town to deliver yet another anti-slavery lecture. 
MAN: That was Garrison! That was Garrison! We'll get him! Hey, we'll get him on the way back out! 
(all yelling) We got something for you! Someone get the tar pots ready! I see you up there! Well, well, here's our little rabbit. Oi, we've got him, he's up here! You're mine. Come on, let's take him down to the others. We'll tar the nigger-loving son of a bitch! Get the rope. 
(yelling) 
NARRATOR: Fortunately for Garrison, two burly men in the crowd took pity on him and rushed him to the town hall. With the mob still calling for Garrison's blood, the mayor put the terrified prr in jail for the night for his own protection. Reeling from his brush with death, Garrison retreated to the Connecticut countryside with his wife Helen, who was pregnant with their first child. Garrison told colleagues that he needed to stay with Helen and the new baby. In fact, he had been shaken to his core, his faith in his fellow man poisoned, his hope for his country undermined. 

[00:37:00]


STEWART: Garrison begins to suspect that every part of American society is infected by a deep moral disease. And he starts to say, "The churches are pro-slavery; "we're coming out of all the churches. "Politics are pro-slavery; abolitionists should never vote." And he becomes far me radical and far more anti-institutional. 
(cows mooing) 
(rooster crowing) 
NARRATOR: For years, John Brown had been trying to divine God's purpose to make sense of his afflictions. He had once been a successful merchant and tanner, a good provider to his family. But then, suddenly, his life collapsed. A series of business disasters plunged him deep into debt. Brown is drifting just further and further into a very deep and dark relationship with God. He's always trying to discern what God wants for him. That's really what Calvinism is all about. You're eternally in sin. You're just constantly trying to get out of it like a drowning man. 
NARRATOR: In November of 1837, news came that an anti-slavery printer had been murdered by a mob in Illinois. Elijah Lovejoy's death struck at something deep within John Brown, conjuring up a memory that had haunted him for years. 
JOHN BROWN: When I was a child, I stayed for a short time with a very gentlemanly landlord who held a slave boy near my own age. The master made a great pet of me while the Negro boy was badly clothed, poorly fed, and beaten before my eyes with iron shovels or any other thing that came first hand. 

[00:39:12]


NARRATOR: For Brown, Lovejoy's death was a sign from God: he must never again stand helpless in the face of evil. As he dressed for a prayer meeting a few days after the killing, John Brown knew what God meant for him. He sat silently as one speaker after another fired up the congregation with accounts of Lovejoy's death. Finally, John Brown stood up and raised his right hand. "Here before God," he announced, "in the presence of these witnesses, "from this time, I consecrate my life to the destruction of slavery." A few months earlier, scores of abolitionists had descended on New York for a training session. William Lloyd Garrison came, as did Angelina and Sarah Grimk??. Though Garrison gave a rousing speech, Angelina's head was turned by a striking young theologian who ran most of the sessions. Theodore Weld had committed himself totally to the anti-slavery cause, and had even pledged not to marry until the slaves were free. 
BERKIN: Angelina thinks he walks on water. She thinks he is the most amazing man, that he is filled with the passion of abolition. He trains them, teaches them, and sends them off to give talks. I stand before you as a Southerner, exiled from the land of my birth by the sound of the lash and the piteous cry of the slave. I stand before you as a repentant slaveholder. I feel that I owe it to the suffering slave and the deluded master. To do all that I can to overturn a system built up upon the bodies of my countrymen and cemented by the blood and sweat and tears of my sisters in bonds. 

[00:41:45]


BERKIN: Of course since they're women, to speak in front of a mixed-- or as they called it, "promiscuous"-- audience of men and women was absolutely forbidden. The abolitionists are ardent desirers of respectability for their movement. So when men start to come to her talks, their antenna go up. And when they tell her to stop talking to men, she says, "No, I have a right." 
NARRATOR: The Grimk??s quickly found themselves at the center of a storm. Ministers condemned them and warned of the dangers that loomed if women moved away from their assigned sphere. Many abolitionists agreed. As the arguments escalated, Angelina began linking the rights of enslaved people to the rights of women. Garrison stood by the embattled sisters, but Weld did not. "Women's rights should not be your preoccupation," he told Angelina, "at least not until the slaves are free." Grimk??'s pain and anger came through in her reply. 
ANGELINA GRIMKE: Can't you just stand here side by side with us? Can you not see that women could do, and would do, a hundred times more for the slave if she were not shackled? 
NARRATOR: By the time their six-month tour finally ended in the fall of 1837, Angelina could go no further; she collapsed with typhoid fever. 
(indistinct chatting) 

[00:43:55]


NARRATOR: As she was recovering, Angelina wrote to Theodore, saying she hadn't realized how much he disliked her. 
BERKIN: And he writes back to her, "You're young and you have too much pride and you're not helping the cause." And then in great big letters, three times the size of the rest of the letter, he writes, "I have loved you from the first moment I met you." And I'm sure Angelina had the same response I had in reading, "You're terrible, you're prideful, "I love you... I... what?" My dear, look at you. You're beautiful. 
ANGELINA GRIMKE: Your letter was indeed a great surprise, my brother, and yet it was no surprise at all. I feel, my Theodore, that we are the two halves of one whole, two bodies animated by one soul, and that the Lord has given us to each other. 
NARRATOR: In the spring of 1838, Angelina and Theodore's friends received a wedding invitation adorned with an engraving of a slave in chains. It would be a ceremony unlike any other. The couple improvised their vows, denounced a man's authority over his wife, and to cap it all off, they had a black minister and a white minister lead the congregation in prayer. And I reject all authority, all government, save the influence which love gives us over each other. May the sun continue to shine as it now does, and may our Father guide us in love through the rest of our pilgrimage. 
(sobbing happily) 
(laughing and cheering) 
GARRISON: Brothers and sisters. Mr. and Mrs. Weld have chosen to solemnize their union not by the illegitimate authority of state or church, but by your witness. 

[00:46:05]


JEFFREY: All kind of rumors had been flying around Philadelphia about the wedding and the guest list and the social amalgamation, or mixing, that had gone on. 
NARRATOR: As news of the event filtered out, the city grew tense. By the time Angelina and Theodore attended an anti-slavery convention two days after the wedding, Philadelphia was seething with racial tension. The meeting was held in Pennsylvania Hall, which had been constructed as a haven for free speech. The leaders of the movement are on the stage. And as they're speaking, as they're holding their meeting, they begin to hear noise outside, and the noise grows and grows ans. And then they begin to see the rocks hitting the windows. And they realize that they're in danger. 
NARRATOR: Angelina Weld kept speaking as showers of stones pelted the windows. Shattered glass cascaded to the floor. 
ANGELINA GRIMKE: What is the mob? What would thereaking of every window be: any evidence that we are wrong, or that slavery is a good and wholesome institution? What if that mob should burst in upon us and commit violence on our persons? Would this be anything compared with what the slaves endure? 
NARRATOR: The following night, a crowd broke into the empty hall and set fire to the building. Firemen stood aside and watched it burn. Soon, Philadelphia's monument to free speech lay in ruins. Only days after the burning of Pennsylvania Hall, a shaken Angelina moved with Theodore to a rustic farm in New Jersey. There, far from the violence and upheaval of abolition's front lines, they would take up their most influential work. American Slavery As It Is was a book made up of first-hand accounts of slavery: handbills for runaway slaves, court records, and the words of slave owners themselves. A mammoth undertaking, it was an irrefutable answer to the argument that slavery was a necessary and benevolent institution. Grimk?? was unflinching in her own account. 

[00:48:54]


ANGELINA GRIMKE: I saw slavery in the city, among the fashionable and the honorable. There, everything cruel and revolting is carefully concealed from strangers. I have known the mistress of a family to borrow servants to wait on company because their own slaves had been so cruelly flogged that they could not walk without limping at every step, and their putrefied flesh emitted such an intolerable smell that they were not fit to be in the presence of company. 
NARRATOR: American Slavery As It Is became the best-selling book in the country. But with its publication, Angelina Grimk??'s public career was over. Her health had been severely weakened by her public ordeals, leaving her barely able to cope with the demands of motherhood. For all that, Angelina Grimk?? never surrendered the vision of a more perfect society in which black and white, men and women, walked together in the ways of God. 
BERKIN: She's exhausted from fighting. And yet she really never lets go of doing what is morally right. But she's not the same know-it-all obnoxious girl she wawhen she was younger. Now she's genuinely a humanist. She's genuinely a person with great empathy for people who suffer, and great sensitivity to the inequalities in society. 
NARRATOR: By 1840, after ten years of struggle, William Lloyd Garrison was drifting away from many of his old allies, alienating them with what they considered irrelevant heresies. Rather than backing down, Garrison upped the ante. Because the Constitution itself was corrupt, he charged, the Union was fatally flawed. Garrison insisted that abolitionists renounce their government; that they withdraw from citizenship and refuse to vote. 

[00:51:18]


WILLIAM LLOYD GARRISON: The American Union was effecby a guilty compromise between the free and slave-holding states; in other words, by incorporating the slave system into the government. In the language of scripture, it was "a covenant with death, and an agreement with hell." The first American republic, the one invented in the Revolution in the late 18th century, had to die. It is so deeply flawed by the fact that human beings are property, that that republic is doomed; it must be crushed, it must be changed and reinvented. 
NARRATOR: Many of Garrison's old friends had had enough. Some of them had been deeply offended by his support of women's rights. Others thought it lunacy for a reform movement to ignore politics, or to insist that supporters refrain from voting. And a few were quietly wondering whether non-violence could ever free the slaves. In May of 1840, they quit the American Anti-Slavery Society. The organization remained, with Garrison at its head, but membership and income plummeted. The infighting left the abolition movement fragmented and disheartened. Many wondered whether it would disappear altogether. Time and again, Garrison, Grimk??, Weld, and their kindred spirits had sounded the warning: the republic couldn't forever encompass the ideal of liberty and the reality of slavery. For their beliefs, they had been reviled, mocked, beaten, and imprisoned. But they had exposed the fatal weakness in the Union and set the natjon on course to the gravest crisis in its history.

[00:02:00]


By the way, nice costume. What's your beard made of? Hair from the drain. No wonder you smell like Cleveland's butt. He-yah! He-yah! (gasps) Oh, suck! What was that noise? Nothing. Junior broke your recorder! Really? My $1,100 Berchtesgaden Fleitl? Damn it, this is why I told you not to play Gay-Disney Pirate Adventure in the house! Both: We're sorry. You know I'm supposed to play the opening of the new Christina Ricci Mistubishi dealership in Tuckahoe this Saturday. How am I supposed to do that now? Why don't you use one of your other recorders? Do you hear yourself? Do you think Yo-Yo Ma would just play one of his other cellos if he broke Petunia? Probably. If he had to. Well, I am not Yo-Yo Ma! I'm Yo-Mama! And you best bring me a new one by Saturday. We don't have $1,100! Then I suggest you do what nine percent of Americans are too lazy to do, and get a job. (clinking) Mmm! (makes kissing sound) Ugh! No, Junior, it's not a wedding. I know. (clears throat) Ladies and "genitalmen." (giggles) But seriously, there's a great man here today. That man... is me. (clears throat) But seriously...

Hey, here's my gift, Freight. Well, Al B. Sure! A title fight in Vegas! Plane leaves in two hours. Luther "Black Guy" Jones versus Mario "Mexican Guy" Salazar. That fight's been sold out for months. How'd you get these? I pretended to be ae-a-Wish kid named Gerald. (chuckles) Classic hustle. All right, let's get to Vegas. But you can't go tonight! You haven't even tried to blow out the trick candles I got you-- (clears throat) I mean, regular candles. One blow should do it. Let's blow this place. I'll just save these for next year. Don't worry. I'm peeing, I'm peeing. Donna, stand in front of me. Ah... How are we gonna come up with $1,100 by Saturday? Well, you areon a street corner. Hot dog stand? Kinda. Rallo, check this out!

Did you know there's a hepatitis J? (chuckles) Vegas is crazy. (laughs) Oh, I know. I went to the M&M Store once. Yeah, we got real crazy. So crazy that we decided to make him and me official.

You got married? What? Hell no. That would be ridiculous. I adopted him. He's my son now. What?! I've always wanted a son I could point to and say, "See that man over there in the tracksuit? "That's my son, my boy, my spawn. No one wears a tracksuit like my son." You've never seen me in my romper. I'll go get it. (sighs) Come on, cool son. Let's go rustle up a few hustles.

Both: Man, I could use a drink. I know where my dad keeps his schnapps. What about gin? Nah, gin makes me cry. (whispering): Quiet, you'll wake up Dad. What's he use this room for? He writes mystery novels under the name Jocelyn Elderwood. (giggling) I'm going to tell you a secret right now that I've never told anybody. (clears throat) I've never danced for my father. Also, he hates me. Teach me. Teach me how to impress my dad. How to hus-tul. You mean, "hustle"? No, "hus-tul." There's a "T." You're missing the "T." That's the problem with you; you play by the rules. The only rule of hustling is there are no rules. Then how do you know whose turn it is? (sighs) You've got a lot to learn, little bro. As long as it's not reading or writing cursive, I'm your man. (barking) I heard you found my dog. Which one is it? Bark. Bark. Where's our 40 bucks? You didn't read the flier closely. It said, "40 barks." Here you go. Both: Bark, bark, bark, bark, bark, bark... Ah, forget it. We'll never make enough by Saturday. Junior, check this out. (cash register dings) 5,000 bucks!

[00:12:06]


Don't I know you? I know, I know. I get that a lot, but I'm not him. (train horn blowing in distance) (beeping) Cool, a forklift! What is this place? This is Hustle House. Or suld I say, your classroom. Over here, we've got 600 boxes of hollowed-out soap. Perfect hustle. It runs out after two days, and by then, you're long gone. (laughs) I'd kill to get in on that hustle. Over there, you got your weenie pills, enlargers, pumps, your various penile miscellany. All right, Cleveland, first, I'm putting you on quality control. We're gonna watch this bootleg Chinese version of The Hangover. I am typical fat and lazy American who have no chance of surviving when China take over! (both laugh) A bologna suit. Why do we wait so long to do the things we know will make us happy? Now, here's what we're gonna do. We're gonna roll you down this hill, and then... (dogs snarling, Cleveland Jr. screaming) Oh, my God! Ron! We're rich! (laughs) Stop that. Stop that. Why are you licking me? Ah, you must like me more than bologna. (chuckles) But I don't care how cute you are, you're notng but a dollar sign to me. All right, I love you. (screaming) Hey, you found Rock Hudson! (screaming) (giggling): Ooh... That's badass. I've always wanted to look like an Italian or Armenian or Arab guy. Or black guy. Or black guy. ROBERT (ringtone): Yo, you got a call. What up? Whoa, that is a big hustle. But I'm tied up all week.

Ooh! Pick me! I'll get back to you. What am I gonna do? I need someone I can trust, like... a brother. Uh, Robert. I don't know, man. This is the big leagues. We're talking a three, possibly four-figure deal. No way! Come on, let me be a legitimate hustler like you so my dad loves me. You really want to dance for your father, don't you? (sighs) A'ight, go to our satellite office in the back of the old gun shop in Pittsburgh. Everything you need to know is in here. I won't let you down, bro. I trust these instructions aren't in cursive? You are hustling your brother, no? Yes. Yes, I am. And this is just the beginning. (laughing maniacally) 19, crush turned out to be a mutual attraction.

When you get back, I want to hear about them. I'd... I'd like that. May I dance for you? Not yet. Oh, hey, Junior. I was gonna ask you something. What was it? Oh, yeah. Where the hell's my money?! You said I had till Saturday. Is that what I said, Larry? W-Why do you have Larry? We were just talking about how disappointed I would be if I didn't get to perform on Saturday at that new car dealership. Miss Donna, we're on the verge of a big score... Don't verge me! I need that recorder, Junior! My ducats is due! (laughs) (sighs) Cleveland Brown, badass hustler. Give me some skin. Where's your Purell? Now, you're gonna be delivering phony autographed head shots for display in dry cleaners across the country. (whistles) Erin Gray. Hey, Robert. I'm done with my hustles. ROBERT: You went to 30 dry cleaners already? I thought that would take you all week. I hustled. (laughs) All right, I'll think of some more and get back at you. Okay! Bye! Okay, nice work. Thanks for your help. I have no idea how anyone would know where to go, but you're welcome. Hey, brother, I'm done here, so I'm heading back. Also, I can't poop anywhere but home; I'm about eight pounds over where I was. ROBERT: Hold up, I got something else for you. Kim Kardashian wore a goose coat at the Fat Armenian Awards. Now everybody was a goose coat. So, you're heading up north to Canada to pick up 400 geese.

Of course you're good at this. You're the inventors of the game. That's like playg Chinese checkers against the Czechs. What am I doing? Chasing wild geese, it's like some wild-goose ch... Son of a bitch! Robert! Okay, one more game. Duck. Duck. Duck. Lunchtime, Rock. Mama hasn't been to the store yet so all we got is pigs feet and baking soda. Rock Hudson? Rock Hudson?! Oh, my God! You looking for that dog? Junior left with him about 40 minutes ago. If you walk slowly, you should be able to catch up to him. You're right! (doorbell rings) Junior, wait! Oh, heo. You must be here for the pool party. The ad implied you would be older. And thinner. And whiter. No, Mr. Waterman, sir. We found your dog and would like our $5,000 reward please. No, we're keeping him! Actually, he's my wife's dog. I can't stand the little bastard. He barks at all my guests. The sweaty delivery man I invited in for a shower. The sweaty gardener I invited in for a shower. The sweaty fireman... We get it. I keep leaving the door open so he'll run away, but he keeps finding his way back. 

[00:22:14]


Don't you, you little rooster-blocker? (growls) So, sounds like it might be worth something to you if you never saw this dog again. Are you extorting me? I would never... (barking) All right, fine! Here's everything in my wallet. $5,000 and a picture of Pat Sajak at the beach? I'm keeping this. I love you, Rock Hudson. Don't say that! You know how many people died not too long after saying that? Oh, my God! Larry! You gonna die, jungle cat! Wait! Oh, you made it, just in time. (playing "When the Saints Go Marching In") Keep your head down around here, Rock. Mama crazy. (barks) (tires scree) Cable installer? But that's my awful job! (tires screech) Terry! Who have you been working with this week? Robert. What's his last name? I don't know. Oh, my God! That's him! Guys, has anyone been in here drinking with you this Yeah, Robert has. No! This can't be happening! Wait, that hasn't been Cleveland sitting here? (speaking Japanese) Yeah. Lobert. No...! So, every time the dealership sold another hatchback, obviously, I played this. (playing "The Farmer in the Dell") There you are, brother! I thought I might find you here... Oh, cute dog. You tricked me! You're trying to steal my life! Cleveland, what are you talking about? He hustled me! You hustled yourself. But more accurately, I hustled you. But why? Look at your life, fool. You have everything. You always did. You had the coolest dad in town. The baddest mom. You had a damn Millennium Falcon. 

[00:24:14]


You think I had a Millennium Falcon growing up? You don't think I wanted to run around going, "Pew! Pew! Pew!" All I had was an old pair of pants I found in the woods. Corduroy? And look at your ass today-- dinner on the table, laundry done, drinking every night and coming home to have sex with a woman you ain't even got to hold down. This is the real Hustle House. And you're the real hustler. Wait a minute, Robert. You hustled your own brother? You don't hustle family. I'm disappointed in you, son. But, Dad... Don't you sass me. Get over here! (grunting) No! No! I'm sorry, Dad! I'm sorry! (cryin: Oh... Oh, it hurts! (crying) Ha, ha! Ha, ha! And he went in your liquor cabinet. I got it made. I'm the coolest hustler in this town. You heard Robert say so himself, Dad. So, I guess I finally earned your respect. I'm not saying you earned my respect, but you may dance for me. (crying) (playing "Private Dancer") Oh, it hurts!

All right. Excuse us. Uh, the 911 caller said the south tower. Right. Which you get to from the central plaza on the third floor. No, you cross around the corridor. Well, you know what? We'll just see who gets there first. Hey! There's no reason for you to have called the police. I called the police because no one can explain what happened to my son! Ms. Langner, please, let me get you a grief counselor. I don't need a grief counselor! I want those doctors arrested! Let's discuss this in my office. Detective daniels, lapd, priority homicide. Help me. They murdered my son! Ok, just take a breath. Take a breath. [Hyperventilating] [breathing slower] ok? So, what's going on here? I brought my son nicky in for a simple endoscopy... And now he's dead. They killed him. Detective. If I may. There's no question that we've had a terrible tragedy here tonight. But the presence of police, it just seems to be inflaming the situation. It might be best for everyone if you just went home. I'm sorry. You do not tell the lapd to go home. Detective, please. Don't overreact to this situation. 

[00:02:01]


It is common to hear accusations like this from people who have lost children. But I can assure you the doctors took all heroic measures to save the boy's life. I'd like to hear that from them. Dr. Woods and dr. Sands are unavailable. Since you refuse to cooperate, and I have reasonable suspicion regarding this attended death... Reasonable suspicion? I am designating the o.R. A crime scene. Oh, for god's sake! No one touches the body, nothing is disturbed or removed. Please secure the operating suite. Let's go. Sorry to pull you guys away from dinner. The speeches were endless. The food never came. I was about to eat my napkin. Well, we have a problem. What's going on here? The mother over here, melissa langner, her son nicky came in for a routine procedure-- are you in charge? Talk to the lady. Deputy chief brenda leigh johnson. I'll be with you in a minute, sir. Go on. So, her son, went through surgery to stop some minor gastric bleeding, there were some complications, he died, and now she's saying that he was murdered. Thank you, sergeant. And you are? Howard pierce, administrative director of southwest pacific university hospital. One of your people has shut down our operating room. That was daniels' call before I got here. Ok. I'd be happy to address your concerns as soon as I get more information. One moment, please. Oh, excuse me. This is the woman I was speaking of. Ms. Langner. I'm deputy chief brenda leigh johnson of the lapd. I'm sorry to press you at a time like this, but I need to know why you think your son was murdered. 

[00:04:03]


Nicky started throwing up around 6:15. There was a little blood. I'm a fourth-year medical student. I knew it probably wasn't anything too serious, but I didn't want to misdiagnose him, so I brought him here so that they could scope him. 10 minutes later, he was in major surgery. 20 minutes later, he was dead. That's a... That is a terrible story, ms. Langner, but what makes you think it was a crime? Because... When I questioned dr. Woods, the vascular surgeon, about the cause of death, he kept changing his answer. And after the third response, he just looked at the other doctor, the g.I. Specialist... And I saw it in their eyes. They are covering something up. Ms. Langner-- please... Help me. Please? Oh... Could the bruises be from how he was handled during surgery? No. I doubt it. The yellow suggests they happened much earlier. Is that a video camera? 

[00:06:07]


You should know as soon as your grieving mother went to the bathroom, those guys appeared. They've been huddling. Looks like they're planning their next play. And they are leaving. I don't think they're a flight risk. Mr. Pierce, I believe we've gotten off on the wrong foot. I'm confident that with your cooperation, we can resolve this issue right now. I agree. All I need is the surgery video, the boy's charts, and to have a short conversation with the physicians. Well, that's not going to happen. Excuse me? You want to resolve this quickly, let me help you. There...Was...No... Murder. Sergeant gabriel, please notify building operations that we'll be shutting down this floor. Nothing goes in or out without our permission. Nothing. You can't do that! One more word out of you and I will padlock this entire hospital and arrest you for interfering with a murder investigation. We don't know there was malpractice, much less a crime, much less murder. So let's be clear about what's going on here. You're launching a full-fledged investigation into a nationally respected hospital based on the hunch of a hysterical woman. Daniels and I both felt she might be telling the truth. Ok. Make that 3 hysterical women. I know you don't want me to respond to that. No. What it looks like to me is a grieving mother desperate to pin the blame for her son's death on somebody. Ever consider she might be pinning it on those responsible? Todd woods is one of the top vascular surgeons in the country. What possible motive could he or this other doctor have for murdering an 8-year-old boy? Well, then, if there's no issue, why won't this mr. Pierce, this jerk of a hospital administrator, help me? Brenda, just because somebody doesn't share your agenda doesn't make them a jerk. Dr. Woods was decorated for his work as a trauma surgeon during the first gulf war. He pioneered the use of carotid stents. Dr. Sands has performed over 2,000 endoscopic procedures. He's been recognized-- thank you. I get it. The attending physicians are geniuses. Now, like chief johnson, 

[00:08:07]


I am committed to resolving this with the least inconvenience for all involved. Then end the criminal inquiry. If ms. Langner continues to harbor doubts about her son's treatment, she has numerous civil remedies available to her. We are asking for minimal cooperation. And I am telling you that these doctors' records are protected, and they will remain confidential. And let me give you a word of warning, sir-- the legal principles at stake in this case are more important than you seem to imagine. Now, I urge you to think very carefully about what you do next. Martha, get me martin garnett, please. Thank you. Garnett's the deputy district attorney. I'm gonna ask him to have the grand jury issue subpoenas for everything related to the langner case. Just to satisfy my own stupid, uninformed curiosity. There's no reason to involve a grand jury. I can arrange for the doctors to speak with you and for the hospital to turn over the video. But the charts remain sealed. That's better. And how long will this take? I hope we don't need to make an appointment. I'll be back in 2 hours. Excellent. Thank you. Thank you so much. Wow. The motto is, "first do no harm." They should add second, don't be so obnoxious. You realize that by limiting the information they turn over, they're trying to guide our conclusions. You're welcome, brenda. Thank you. As you can see, there was already significavt bleeding when I began the egd. Brenda: The egd? Esophagogastro duodenoscopy. It's when the doctor slides the scope down the patient's throat to get a visualization of the upper gastrointestinal tract. What causes this kind of bleeding? Hematemesis. Vomiting blood. It can be caused by gastritis, or in rare cases, mallory-weiss tears. Which are? Burst blood vessels in the mucosa of the esophagus. 

[00:10:10]


I did a year in medical school. Cauterization should reduce that bleeding, but, uh, 3 minutes into the procedure, the patient's blood pressure dropped to 60 over 30, and I began transfusing with o-negative and called for surgical backup. I arrived less than 10 minutes later, and performed an emergency laparotomy. Exploring the abdominal cavity for hemorrhage. At 19:16, the patient coded. At 19:19, I discovered a bleed in the left gastric artery. As I began suturing this perforation, the patient flatlined. Despite closing this rupture, the patient's diastolic pressure never rose above 20 millimeters. Repeated attempts to establish a normal sinus rhythm failed, and we pronounced the patient dead at 19:31. Thank you, buzz. If you were to review your charts with our forensic pathologists, would they be entirely consistent with what you just told us? No. No. The charts would indicate something significant beyond that. Over the past 6 months, melissa langner brought her son to the e.R. Repeatedly with complaints ranging from allergies to asthma to acute gastric distress. The exact cause of these various ailments remains undetermined, but they share one common element. They all could have been artificially induced. And as you saw last night, melissa langner is emotionally unstable. Are you suggesting melissa langner deliberately made her son sick? I am. And the treating physicians thought this might be a case of munchausen's by proxy and so listed it on the boy's charts. Doctors woods and sands were concerned that bringing these allegations to your attention would needlessly complicate a tragedy. But if you're certain this is murder, then I'd consider melissa langner a serious suspect. ] coughequence??????

me. depression. Before taking abilify, an antidepressant alone helped me get out from under. But sometimes...Depression still dragged me down. I'd been feeling stuck for a long time. So my doctor added abilify to my antidepressant. She said some people had symptom improvement as early as 1 to 2 weeks. Now I feel more in control of my depression. [ Female Announcer ] ABILIFY IS NOT FOR EVERYONE. Call your doctor if your depression worsens or you have unusual changes in behavior, or thoughts of suicide. Antidepressants can increase these in children, teens, and young adults.

Elderly dementia patients taking abilify have an increased risk of death or stroke. R doctor if you have high fever, stiff muscles, and confusion to address a possible life-threatening condition. Or if you have uncontrollable muscle movements, as these could become permanent. High blood sugar has been reported with abilify and medicines like it and in extreme cases can lead to coma or death. Other risks include increased cholesterol, weight gain, decreases in white blood cells, which can be serious, dizziness on standing, seizures, trouble swallowing, and impaired judgment or motor skills. Depression was always hanging over me. Then my doctor added abilify to my antidepressant. Now I feel better.

Well, we are committed to discovering exactly what happened to nicholas. I don't believe you've met lieutenant tao. My condolences. Ms. Langner, this morning, dr. Woods and dr. Sands gave their statements, and they maintain your son died from severe internal bleeding, despite dr. Woods having closed a perforation in the left gastric artery. Have you seen the charts yet? We haven't, but we've been assured there's nothing in there that would contradict the video of your son's surgery. I'm sorry to ask you questions on such a hard day, but we were also told that in recent months, nicky's made approximately a dozen trips to the e.R. Is that true? 

[00:16:14]


Nicky had always been a healthy kid. And then his dad died last july. It was totally unexpected. Oh, my. So nicky is the second family member you've lost in a year? That's so unfortunate. After my husband died, I was almost suicidal. I'm so sorry. Have you been talking to anyone about this? Yes. And with antidepressants, things improved. But nicky, suddenly, he was sick. All the time. It was like he picked up every germ. The flu, the chickenpox. Yesterday, he was vomiting blood. Do you have any idea what might have caused your son to throw up? There are a hundred different physical reasons. Or it could have been a lot of stress. Losing his dad, being in a new school. Was nicky being treated for anything that might have affected his motor coordination? No. Why? Well, when we examined nicholas, he seemed to have several bruises. Was he bumping into objects or falling down a lot? How else do you think he might have sustained those injuries? Are you suggesting I hurt nicky? We have to consider all the possibilities. That...Isn't... A possibility. That's an insult. My son was everything to me. Do you really believe I would have hit him? Do you? Maybe not hit him, but hurt him. 

[00:18:15]


Doctors have access to things that can make children sick, and you're a medical student. Well, thank you for your commitment to finding out what happened, ms. Johnson. But I won't be needing your help anymore. Mrs. Langner. We have to help, whether you like it or not. Last 10 years, I've worked 3 cases of munchausen by proxy. Moers are supposed to be making their kids sick to get sympathy for themselves. It's bl. And what about all the surveillance tapes of parents overdosing their kids and smothering them with pillows. Hey, I'm not saying it never happens. But every case I saw, there was always a sick kid, a pain in the ass mom, and a doctor who wanted them both to disappear. Easiest way to accomplish that is say the word munchausen. Ok, lieutenant flynn, we appreciate your perspective, but as you are our resident expert in munchausen's by proxy, please... You want the profile, fine. The fbi says that the vast majority of munchausen perpetrators are women. 80 percent have medical backgrounds, and most are under psychiatric treatment. So far we're batting a thousand. Anything else? Parent tends to keep their child from other adults and away fm outside activities like playing with other kids. We know anything about nicholas langner's extended family? School, friends, anything? Nicky attended robert hutchins academy. It's an expensive private school. The teacher said he's intelligent, hardworking, shy. One last thing, chief. When munchaun happens among medical people, it's to cause illness, then save the kid to impress other doctors. An added incentive for melissa langner. The doctors treating her son were the same ones she'd have for medical rotations. Whatever happened to good old fashioned brown-nosing? Daniels: Preliminary autopsy report. Nicholas langner died from massive internal bleeding. 

[00:20:15]


Dr. Crippen found 3 pres drugs in his system, all within acceptable levels, and none could have acted with that specificity on his gastric artery. Ok. Lieutenant provenza, please get a warrant and search melissa langner's house. Keep a special eye out for any substances that might not have shown up in her son's blood work but could've made him sick. Lieutenant flynn, please keep looking for langner relatives. Sergeant gabriel, I think we ought to find out if nick langner played well with others. What's the name of his school again? Many of these kids haven't even lost a pet. Imagine trying to explain the death of a classmate. My nicky was such a special little boy. Did you have much interaction with his mother? In 25 years of teaching, I've dealt with a lot of overprotective parents, but they pale in comparison to melissa langner. What do you mean by that? Well, for example, when nicky first arrived, he was placed with one of our younger instructors. But ms. Langner reduced her to tears so often with so many accusations of carelessness that I moved him into my own class. As we discussed, nicky hadn't been here very long, and he was shy. Tyler crosby wasn't just his best friend, he was his only friend. I've gotten permission from tyler's mother to have him speak with you, but, of course, you will be sensitive to what he's going through? Absolutely, ma'am. Of course. Tyler. I'm brenda leigh johnson. Do you know why I'm here? Nicky. That's right. We're here to talk about your friend. It's hard when someone you care about passes away. I'm sorry. I didn't mean to. I didn't. I was only playing. You didn't mean to what? I didn't mean to kill him. I'm sorry. 

[00:22:16]


Ease don't arrest me. Why--why do you think you killed him? His mom said not to wrestle. He came at me. He made me. What--what did you do? I turned him over and I held him down. But he was laughing. I didn't mean to hurt him. Please don't tell nicky's mom. Please, I'm afraid of her. Did nicky's mom threaten you? She warned me not to hurt him. Oh... [Tyler crying] langner's house has padding on every table corner and covers on all the electrical outlets. I'm telling you, this is a mom who wanted to build a giant bubble around her kid. All the medicine cabinets are full of vitamins. Not to mention 3 half-empty bottles of ipecac. That induces vomiting. You do that enough and anybody's insides will start to bleed. Chief, I found melissa langner's in-laws in... Rancho palos verdes. Beverly and walter langner. They're in your office, and they want to talk. Ok. We were both... Horrified by nicky's death, but not completely surprised. This past year... Since our son died so unexpectedly, melissa's become increasingly, well... Paranoid. She refused to let us near nicky. We had to sue her to get limited visitaon with our own grandson. What reasons did she give the judge for denying you visits? She claimed that nicky was tosick to spend time away from home and that my occasional cigar at dinner posed an unreasonable health risk. If he was sickly, it was only because melissa made him that way. 

[00:24:16]


But I don't blame her alone. That boyfriend of hers played a part in this. Um, you didn't mention a boyfriend. A couple of months after our son died, she took up with this guy she dated in high school. Jason higgins. She never let us meet him, but the second that nicky told us about him, I had him checked out. He has an ex, he owes alimony, he owes child support, and there's a restraining order against him, too. Years back, we set up a trust for our son. And, uh, after he died, it passed on to our grandson, and... Now that he's gone, too, that money-- it's $3 million today-- goes to melissa, and if she marries him, this jason higgins. ] FiOS Is the fastest internet in america.

According to langner's parents, higgins has anger issues, so... We're gonna play good cop/bad cop. You' not gonna make me be the good cop, are you? I don't think that's possible, lieutenant. How bad do you want me to be? Go for broke. Mr. Higgins, deputy chief brenda leigh johnson of the lapd. I just can't believe he's dead. I mean, the little guy got sick a lot, but I really thought he'd grow out of it. I was the same way when I was his age. Yeah, and look at you now. Easy, lieutenant. How would you describe melissa langner's behavior over the last several months? Melissa...And I have known each other since we were 15. She's always been, I don't know, tightly wound. And her husband goes and drops dead on his morning jog, I mean, that's enough to make anybody lose it a little bit. Do you believe melissa langner lost it? Wh--you think melissa had something to do with nicky's death? No way. Oh, no. Melissa's whole life was about nicky. She was totally obsessed with that kid. And how's your financial situation, mr. Higgins? Is this about my ex-wife? 'Cause I settled with her 3 months ago, and I've made every payment since then. I'll show you the canceled checks if you want. Why, you got 'em on you? We understand your ex-wife took out a restraining order on you? Yeah! Because she wouldn't tell me why she was leaving and I got a little mad. I sense that. Did you ever get mad like that with nick? No! Do I look like the kind of guy who'd beat up on an 8-year-old kid? Are talking boy or girl? Hey, screw you! Well, if that's an offer, you might be a little friendlier about it. Lieutenant. I asked you not to jump to conclusions. It could be that mr. Higgins here had nothing to do with this crime. Now, when was the last time you saw nick langner? All of a sudden I'm a suspect? I ain't seen nicky since last wednesday night when I broke up with melissa. You broke up with melissa langner? Why do you think I didn't know anything about what happened to nicky? 

[00:31:31]


I don't know, chief. If this guy didn't want the kid but wanted the money, why break up with her? Chief. This is something you should see. Jeez, tao, I'm starting to think you enjoy looking at this stuff. These bruises are called purpura, and they can be caused spontaneously by some blood clotting disorders. Are you suggesting maybe nobody hit nicky at all? Wouldn't a clotting disorder have been something that would've been diagnosed before surgery? Or could this have been artificially induced as well? I won't know for sure unless I have dr. Crippen re-examine the body. Try and come back with a definite answer I can understand. And printouts. Chief. Pope's office just called. He needs to see you right away. Oh... Chief johnson. I don't know if you heard, but a couple of nights ago, a lady was strangled to death on laurel canyon. An elderly woman living alone. Yeah. Right. And last night, there was another homicide just around the corner. Could be the start of a spree, so you understand why this investigation has picked up greater urgency. My detectives are already stretched a bit thin, and since priority homicide isn't really doing much right now-- I appreciate the gravity of the situation, commander, but as it so happens, we are busy. I'm close to resolving the nicholas langner investigation. Nicholas langner? The boy who died during surgery? Yes. This past day has opened up new leads. We are looking at a murder a night in the hollywood hills. One more, and this jumps to the papers and all hell breaks loose. Look, I have kids. And what happened to that boy is... It's every parent's worst nightmare. Is the mother suffering? Of course. Is it a case for priority homicide? Absolutely not. It's not. It just is not. Now, get your people to robbery-homicide as soon as possible. Ok, then. Thank you. Commander. 

[00:33:34]


So we're just gonna let it go? And we have to go to robbery-homicide. This is complete crap. We have momentum. We're getting close to something here. Uh, chief, it's lieutenant tao. He says it's urgent. Hold on a second. Chief johnson. Tao: Chief. We got a problem. The morgue released nicholas langner's body. All right. Well, get over to the funeral home before it gets cremated or embalmed. Well, that's the thing. Melissa langner didn't send the body to a funeral home. She released it to her medical school. Ok. Thank you, lieutenant tao. Lieutenant flynn and provenza. Please report to robbery-homicide and give detective ross a hand. Ross, huh? Yeah. I'll give him a hand, all right. Sawed-off little runt. Uh... What about me, chief? You, too, sergeant gabriel. But on your way there, get the deputy d.A. To convene a grand jury to subpoena nicky langner's hospital records. And also the doctors' schedules for last weekend, please. You feel like driving, detective daniels? Where are we going? Robbery-homicide. By way of southwest pacific university. Yes?

Please. Detective daniels and I have gone through all of them. Though the doctors said they'd be there, there is not a single notation on any of these charts indicating munchausen's by proxy. So the reason howard pierce threw out that misdirect? See what time dr. Sands ordered the cbc and chem panel? Uh-huh. And look when he started the endoscopy. Now, I've gone over these test results with forensics. Cbc shows nicholas langner's platelet count at 5,000, about 4 percent of what it would be in a healthy kid. Help me, lieutenant tao. I have no idea what you're talking about. It means he developed a clotting disorder. He'd become sort of a hemophiliac. So a doctor shoves a scope down his throat, makes a tear, and the kid bleeds to death. How would he develop something like this? Is it an illness? Idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura. I'm not even gonna try and pronounce that. Also known as itp. It was probably a temporary after-effect of a viral infection like the chickenpox. Melissa langner said he contracted it a few months back. And a platelet count that low would have caused spontaneous bruising. So, in other words, maybe nobody hit him. Or maybe he wrestled when his mother told him not to. All right, then. Thank you. Good job. Have you looked at my camcorder tape? Not yet. I will. So, ms. Langner, I have to tell you, I have been a criminal investigator for almost 10 years, and I had a very interesting life before that, but this afternoon, that was a first for me. You have to look at the tape. I know you still think I had something to do with nicky's death. Well, what am I supposed to think? Your son contracts a series of unexplained illnesses, you intimidate his teacher, his 9-year-old friend, his grandparents, and then, on top of everything else, you perform an unsanctioned dissection of the boy you say you loved. It was the only way to prove what I believed. 

[00:42:28]


And what your coroner should have discovered. Woods told you... He'd repaired the left gastric artery. He lied. Don't believe me. Look at the tape. Melissa's: I'm under the omentum, and I have located the left... Gastric artery. There. There is the perforation. There are only two stitches in a perforation which needed 8 to 10 for closure. They never sealed the artery. Ok. That's enough, buzz. Thank you. Can you play the hospital surgery footage now? Can you magnify his hands? Just give me one second. What am I looking at? A man... Pretending to stitch while a little boy bleeds out. Thank you, buzz. Howard? I'm sorry, this has gone beyond the purview of the hospital. I believe at this point, you and dr. Woods would be better served by a lawyer. Excuse me, chief johnson. If you gentlemen have seen enough, I'll have questions for you after I speak with deputy district attorney garnett here. Lieutenant tao, would you please escort doctors woods and sands into interview room 1 

[00:44:30]


and read them their rights. Thank you so much. Right this way, doctors. You have the right to remain silent... I'm a little lost. What do you want me to do with these guys? Uh, well, to start with, you could indict them for second-degree murder or conspiracy to commit grievous bodily injury, negligent homicide. Are you joking? Dr. Woods didn't try to help that boy out at all. He's clearly putting on a show for the mera. Or he's a surgeon with poor aim after 16 hours on his feet. Listen, before I can prosecute a crime, I need to establish a crime has been committed.

Putting aside how the jury's gonna react to watching a mother dissect her own son, once the body was released by the morgue, it was outside of the chain of evidence. That tape is completely inadmissible. Nick langner was an 8-year-old boy who went into the e.R. Vomiting and came out dead. And those men did that to him. Well, prove that's what they intended, and we'll talk. Sorry for the hold-up. We try not to keep people waiting so long. I should tell you that I never speak without a lawyer present, so you'll understand if I respectfully decline to answer your questions. You've both invoked your right to counsel, which makes an interview impossible. So I'll just have a theoretical discussion with lieutenant tao here. I don't really have any questions anyway, just some good news for one of you and some very bad news for the other. Lieutenant tao, which should I give them first? I'm thinking they'd like to hear the good news. Ok. Dr. Sands, last sunday night, you killed a young boy due to acts of negligence and malpractice and then lied about it. Gosh... Now that I've said that out loud, the good news doesn't sound so great. It gets better, though. Nicholas langn was admitted to the e.R. At 18:42. At 18:48, dr. Sands ordered a cbc, 

[00:46:32]


chem panel, and coags. Coags were to measure how well nicky's blood would clot. About how long do these tests take, lieutenant tao? At least 20 minutes. And yet, dr. Sands, you began the endoscopy at 18:55, only 7 minutes later, before you could have possibly seen the results of nicky's blood test. Which is a shame. Because those coags would've shown that nicky's platelets were extremely low, indicating a condition called... Lieutenant tao? Idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura. Itp. Actually, if you had looked him over at the er, you might have noticed nicky had itp simply by looking at the bruises on his torso. I know how to diagnose itp. Oh, I'm sorry, are you speaking? Have you revoked your right to counsel? No. Ok. My guess is the reason you didn't notice the bruising was because you just finished a 24-hour shift. If you hadn't had one foot out the door, you might have given nicholas plasma for clotting, had a surgeon standing by, and everything might have been fine. Instead, you rushed into your endoscopy, and considering how tired you were and how much blood was in nicky's stomach, it's not so surprising that you perforated the kid's gastric artery, is it? Don't answer that, dr. Sands. You don't speak without a lawyer. Well, the good news about all of this is that everything that we've just described is merely malpractice. Oh, your insurance premiums may go up, and you may have some bad publicity, but malpractice is not a criminal offense. So you are free to go, dr. Sands. Unfortunately, dr. Woods, I can't say the same thing about you. You are aware that melissa langner's videotape directly contradicts what you told us. You did not repair nicky's gastric artery, though why, I have no idea. It doesn't really matter. The surgeon's report clearly states that you sutured the artery closed. You even billed for it, and that's your signature on the bottom. I'm sure you are aware that falsifying medical records for fraudulent purposes is a felony. I think I see what she's trying to do, but if he speaks without a lawyer, 

[00:48:33]


nothing he says can be used in court. She's trying to get him-- where's everybody at? I thought you were going to see ross. What the-- oh, my. Dr. Sands, you're still here. I got so wrapped up in giving dr. Woods his bad news that I completely forgot you were here. Run along now. Make sure to get your parking validated on the way out. You're not going anywhe. Dr. Woods, I have to advise y not to speak without an attorney. This is ridiculous. I don't need an attorney. I'm revoking my right to counsel. It was his fault. I never expected that you'd do anything but find the bleeding. You knew the kid was hypoxic when he hit the table. I had 3 minutes to find your mistake, and that left me 45 seconds to fix it. The boy had no blood pumped to his brain for almost 4 minutes. So he would've woke up paralyzed, maybe blind, mentally handicapped for the rest of his life, at best. You didn't know that. Ok, ok. Let me see if I've got this straight, doctor. Mm-hmm? Are you saying you could have repaired the artery, but knowing it would take another minute, you chose to let nicholas langner die rather than bring him back in less than pristine condition? No, no, no. Not... [Mimicking Brenda's accent] "Less than pristine condition." Irreparably damaged. But it's possible that he might have been fine, and you wouldn't have known that until you resuscitated him. I had both my hands in that boy's abdomen with seconds, seconds to weigh the likely outcome-- death or severe disability. Not to mention exposing your carelessness. I never asked yo to cover for me. Only because you lack the guts. Given the options, I was presented with, ms. Johnson, I made absolutely the right choice. To kill nicholas langner? Yes. Yes, I let him die because as it so happens, ms. Johnson, 

[00:50:35]


that's my job. Is it? I make more life and death decisions before 10:00 in the morning t people make in a lifetime. On the rare occasion that I can't save someone, I don't have time to weep and point fingers, because in the next room, there's another patient whose life is on the line. I made the right choice with nicholas langner. The only choice that made any sense. And I'd do it again. If you were so certain that you made the right choice, why did you try to blame nicky's mother for her son's death? You knew that munchausen's by proxy was not in any of that boy's charts. Did I not tell you to help robbery-homicide? What are you doing here? Getting a physician to admit to manslaughter. You heard him, mr. Garnett. Todd woods said he chose to let nick langner die. No, that's not what I heard. What I heard was a doctor say in his opinion, he could not save that child's life. And no jury is ever going to convict this man, no judge is ever gonna let it go to trial, and malpractice is not a crime, so at the risk of repeating myself, what do you want me to do? You tell me exactly what you want those doctors to say in order to try them for manslaughter and I will go bacin there and I will get them to say it. I'm sorry, chief johnson. I don't prosecute cases I know I can't win. Excuse me, fellas. You're just like dr. Woods. Unless you're assured a perfect outcome, you walk away. And you're just like this crazy mother here, insisting we treat tragedy as murder. So how about this, ma'am? You pick your battles, I'll pick mine. All right. This case is officially over--now. How soon can you get your people to laurel canyon? 

[00:52:36]


Lieutenant tao... Please report to robbery-homicide. And detective daniels, if you could wait for me. Before I let these doctors go, I want to apologize to melissa langner for the world we live in. Excuse me. Brenda: Ms. Langner. I am so very sorry to have to tell you... Buzz, turn the volume down, please. I can't listen to this. Melissa: Wh...What? [No audio] sorry. Do you want to split it? Oh, no, thanks, chief. Look, detective. I... I know you're upset, but... We did everything we could. We don't punish. We don't...Prosecute. We just... We just find out the truth. 3 gunshots] it's around the corner. Drop your weapon! Right now! Drop your weapon. Right there. Drop it. Turn around! 

[00:54:45]

Mo thank you for watching. From thenn world headquarters in atlanta, good night. 
--Captions by VITAC-- www.vitac.com 
>>> Now to "cnn presents." 2012 is now in the record books as the hottest year ever for the continental united states. Experts say climate change is a big reason. And last year is just a sign of what's to come. Not only higher temperatures but more extreme weather. Storms even more damaging. Even more dangerous. Climate change helped make sandy one of the most devastating storms ever to hit the east coast. And just this week, new york governor andrew cuomo announced proposals designed to prepare for big storms. But what is the rest of the country doing to prepare for the next disaster? We dispatched a team of cnn correspondents across the country and around the world to investigate how bad storms, these storms can become and what we can do now to plan when the next big one hits. 
>> Hurricane sandy threatening to unleash massive damage on the u.S. Northeast. 
>> Conditions are deteriorating very rapidly. 
>> Certainly felt more rain, more wind, stronger gusts. 
>> I've never, in 26 years of forecasting, have seen anything like this. 
>> They are being called superstorms. Fueled by changing climate, higher temperatures, and rising sea levels. 
>> Climate change is real. It's here. It's going to happen again. 
>> People and cities once safe. Now in the eye of the fury. 
>> I see the weather changing. Absolutely. 
>> Is this the era of the superstorm? 
>> Water level is rising substantially. 
>> And are we ready? 
>> If this wall had been here -- 
>> for the next one? 
>> I've been telling everybody, the big flood is coming. We better start building the ark. 

[00:02:12]


>> Living near the ocean, there's always that chance that the ocean is going to come take away everything that you've got. But never did I imagine th this was going to happen to me and my family and my community. 
>> Even now, given all that has happened to him and his family, it is still hard for nick camerada to understand it all. He has lived here, along the shores of staten island, for two decades, with his wife and four boys. Back in 2011, camerada survived hurricane irene. So he paid close attention to reports of another potential hurricane headed his way in late october. 
>> It's been a very fickle storm, but it's going to be sucked in here, into the northeast somewhere. 
>> We were all hoping that the storm was going to blow more towards the south and not come north. 
>> A few miles away, at columbia university, climate scientist adam sobel was keeping an eye on sandy as well. 
>> At the beginning, it was just, look at that, at would be a big deal if that happened. But a week ahead of time, we don't take it that seriously. 
>> It is still four days away. This could have a bigger impact on new york city, connecticut, long island, new jersey, than irene did last year. 
>> As sandy moved north, it merged with a winter storm, creating a superstorm, double the size of a normal hurricane. 
>> The one part storm that was already on land was combining with the hurricane that was offshore. As they combined, it was almost one plus one equals two and a half. 
>> Many in sandy's path evacuated. Nick camerada did not. 
>> At about 6:00, the tide should be way out. I walked down the block, and i started seeing water coming on to cedar grove, and I started yelling and banging on doors for everybody to get out of their houses, because this is going to be a storm of disastrous magnitude. 

[00:04:27]


>> I was, as a scientist, fascinated, but as a citizen of this city, as time went on, i started to feel more and more actual fear. 
>> In new york, as the eye of the storm approached, wind gusts reached 75 miles per hour, and the flood waters outside nick camerada's house were rising, fast. 
>> Try to move the car up the street a little bit, I almost didn't get back to the house. And I couldn't open the door because there was three or four feet of water outside my front door. When I grabbed the front door of my house, I got zapped by the power from the transformer on the pole. I got paralyzed, knocked to my feet. Felt like somebody grabbed my ankles, my body curled up. At that point, I thought I was dead. My wife opened the window and they pulled me through the window and up the stairs, and that's where, you know, we weathered the storm as a family, up on the second floor watching the storm little by little creeping up, you know, to the second story. 
>> When they were talking about 6 to 12 feet surge, I knew we were in trouble. 
>> Dominic and his wife sheila live two blocks away from camerada. Staying with relatives during the storm, they received a troubling call from their next-door neighbor. 
>> He said, look, something's wrong, the front of your house doesn't look right. I said, what do you mean? He said, the whole front is tilted down. 
>> When the massive superstorm made landfall, sandy and its record 16-foot storm surge washed away neighborhoods. 
>> Whoa! 
>> Flooded subway stations and tunnels, and cut electricity for millions of people, including those on staten island. 
>> We never had an idea that it would impact so far north into new york city itself. That's what really surprised me. 

[00:06:29]


>> And this is the house, this is your house here? 
>> This is our house. 
>> What's left of it. 
>> The house that donny and sheila trayna had lived in for 40 years, sandy destroyed in minutes. 
>> If we knew the house was going to blow down, we would have took everything out. 
>> I had a painting that belonged to my grandparents, it WAS FROM THE EARLY 1900s, A Watercolor that's been in our family. 
>> Tough, tough. 
>> It's painful. Sorry. 
>> Yeah. 
>> Many weather experts believe sandy is a grim preview of a future with more powerful and more damaging storms fueled by climate change. 
>> It's not that these storms 
[ouldn't occur and that they wouldn't happen anyway, but there's a little bit of an extra boost. 
>> Dr. Kevin trenberth of the national center for atmospheric research says, without question, the warming of the earth's climate will create more extreme weather. 
>> We know that certainly is the case with hurricanes. The higher sea surface temperature puts more moisture into the atmosphere. That gets sucked up by the storm. There's heavier rainfalls. It boosts the power of that storm a little bit and makes it just a little bit worse than it otherwise would have been. 
>> Adding to the destructive future of these superstorms, rising sea levels, also fueled by climate change. 
>> We have satellites in space that are measuring sea level to millimeter accuracy now. Since 1992, sea level has gone up 2 1/4 inches since then. 
>> We expect several feet more in the next century. If you start with higher water, the storm surge will be added on top ofhat until we get a higher flood. 
>> Rising seas, heightened storm surge, stronger storms, a terrifying prospect facing millions of people living on the east coast. 
>> My community, my neighbors, my best friends, they were all affected by this in a way they are never going to be able to recover. 

[00:08:33]


>> A community overwhelmed, a metropolis brought to a standstill. Can our cities withstand a future of bigger, more powerful storms? ahead career. How do you get from here... to here?

>>> The electrical systems, the fare collectionsystems, the lighting systems, the stairways, the ventilation systems, the elevators, the escalators, they are all pretty much ruined from the water damage, from the surge damage. 
>> Less than 48 hours after the storm struck, new york city's chief infrastructure officer, frank jesky, took us down into the subway system. 
>> We'll take a quick look over there. 
>> To what lood like a scene from a science fiction movie, something beyond imagination. 
>> Believe it or not, these timbers washed in from the ocean or the bay. 
>> This did right here? 
>> Absolutely. 
>> So this washed in -- 
>> all this debris that you see washed in from the tidal surge. 
>> This station, the end of the line for the city's number one subway train, is called south ferry. Three years ago, it was brand new, built at a cost of more than half a billion dollars. Now it's in ruins. 
>> Sandy broke records for the biggest waves in new york harbor, for the biggest surge in new york city, and for the lowest pressure ever north of north carolina. What was the impactful part of sandy was the surge at 12, 15 feet. That surge had never been seen in new york city before. 
>> When we were here, the water was just below this mezzanine level. 
>> Nearly a month after our first interview -- 
>> you can see the rusts on these stair treads. 
>> -- Jesky, this time dressed in a suit and tie, took us back down underground. 
>> It wasn't a rebuild as some of our stations, this was a brand new tunnel station that was built. They've been taken back to the shops and labs -- 

[00:13:20]


>> just rebuilding south ferry station alone can take up to a year or more at a cost he's not even willing to guess about. 
>> We'll start taking components or pieces of the station down, the finished surfaces, the finished ceiling, the acoustic pieces of it. The signal systems will have to be rebuilt. All the conduits and piping will have to be opened up and drained. 
>> Not to mention a sophisticated and intricate control room. 
>> This is the train dispatchers' office. 
>> Looking now as if a bomb had hit it. 
>> The train dispatchers and supervisors would operate out of this office environment. They had several different workstations where they could see the trains coming in and out of the station and further up the line. Completely destroyed. Need to be replaced and rebuilt. 
>> The force of the water so great, it even destroyed escalators designed to last 40 years. 
>> The actual force of the water coming down the escalator lifted the landing plates from position. The pit itself still has several feet of water standing in it. These are one of our escalators that's a total loss. 
>> So this is going to have to come out altogether? 
>> Come out and be replaced. 
>> The destruction here is just a part, a big part, but just a part of the pounding that the infrastructure system took as a result of superstorm sandy. Just imagine, if you will, what happened to the electrical grid on the eastern seaboard. 
>> The northeast, obviously, took a real beating as a result of superstorm sandy. And I think it did reveal a number of weaknesses. Among them, questions have come up fairly, I think, whether the utilities really did a good job overall. 
>> Clark gellings knows more about the nation's power grid than practically anyone. He's a fellow at the electric power research institute. Were you surprised what a beating the system took? 
>> I was surprised for a couple of reasons. One, I really wonder about the severity of those winds. My gosh, the trees that were taken down. We're not talking about a limb that should have been cut and it happened to brush across a line. We're talking about trees from across the street coming down and taking a power line down on the other side of the street. 

[00:15:37]


>> Even more surprising, he says, was just how unprepared some utilities seemed to be. 
>> Some of the utilities involved didn't really have a good what's called "outage management system." There were utilities in the northeast that actually had to do this with paper charts on a wall and didn't really have an effective computer system. 
>> On top of that, gellings says, is the nation's aging electrical infrastructure. 
>> Even major components, take, for example, these large transformers, we call them substation transformers. These are the really big guys. The average age in the united states of those transformers is 42. The design life is 40, so we are running on borrowed time. 
>> Not to mention all those millions of utility poles crisscrossing the country. 
>> You've got poles out there, wood poles, intended actually to be with us for about 40 years, 50 years. They are out there for 80 years. 
>> Money, he says, will help. Some of those overhead wires should be buried underground, but all in all, extreme nature holds all the cards. 
>> Give me all the money in the world, and I'll design a power system that will never fail. The point is, you can't afford to do it. There's just no configuration that I can think of that will be absolutely sandy proof. 
>> It's just so very hard. 
>> Back in staten island, nick camerada says he isn't going anywhere. Despite the destruction, despite the heartache, despite the cost in numbers and the cost no one can really measure. 
>> How are you? 
>> I think a lot of people emotionally and physically at this point would just be done, and yet you keep going. 
>> You have to. Because I have no place to go. I have my whole life sitting here, and I got to pray that it doesn't happen again. I got to pray that this is a 100 year storm, and in another 100 years, maybe my kids' kids' kids will be dealing with this. 

[00:17:41]


>> But will his ch even know the storm is coming? Some experts say maybe not. 
>> We would be blinded, and we would not be able to see what's going on in the system as well as we can now. less pain. Imagine living your life with less chronic low back pain.

>>> Hurricane warnings are in effect for jamaica. 

[00:21:43]


>> The clock started ticking early. 
>> This system is huge. 
>> OCTOBER 22nd, SANDY WAS BORN. 
>> Tropical storm sandy, heading straight for islands in the caribbean. >>He u.S. At least for now is not in the cone. 
>> The initial forecast, she might go out to sea, but that changed quickly. 
>> We were eight days ahead on this storm. We watched this thing on the computers turn left and turn right a couple of times before the one model said this is going to america. This could be a big storm as it makes that turn and slams directly into where new york and new jersey come together. 
>> Seven days before the storm hit, computer predictions, called models, put landfall in new jersey. There was time to get ready, board up, evacuate. 
>> This morning I formally declared a state of emergency in anticipation of hurricane sandy. 
>> When the storm hit atlantic CITY ON THE 29th, IT WAS JUST Five miles, that's it, just five miles, from where the earliest forecast said it would cross the coastline. 
>> It's unprecedented. That's the best word I could use. There's no way any other storm in recent memory has been forecast that good, for that long. 
>> This pinpoint accuracy came from powerful super computers. They digest tremendous amounts of data about climate, wind speed, temperature, atmospheric pressure. From buoys in the ocean, planes flying through and around storms, satellites orbiting the earth. In fact, 90% of the data those computer models relied upon came from satellites. 
>> Command control, engineering data. 
>> Right out of here? 
>> Yep, right out of here. 
>> Katherine sullivan is deputy administrator of the national oceanic and atmospheric administration, noaa. The agency is in charge of monitoring and distributing data from two kinds of satellites. One type, called g.O.E.S., Flies above the equator and provides a close up view of a given area. The other orbit the poles, taking big picture measurements of the planet's atmosphere. 

[00:23:49]


>> It's really critical to let us look ahead into the future, from a day to several days, and understand what the state of the atmosphere will be that will affect weather three, four, five days out. 
>> Days of advanced warning we simply didn't have decades ago. 
>> This town wasust completely demolished. 
>> Something the former mayor of galveston texas, lyda ann thomas, knows all too well. She grew up learning about the deadliest hurricane in u.S. History from her grandfather, who barely survived the storm. 
>> The water rose and met in the middle of the island, so the whole island was under water. 
>> The entire island of galveston was submerged? 
>> Entire island. All 35 miles of it. 
>> At least 8,000 people died THAT DAY, SEPTEMBER 8th, 1900. 145-mile-per-hour winds, no warning, 75 years before satellites and high-tech forecasting. There really wasn't any way to know, was there, how bad it was going to be? 
>> They had no idea. Overnight they were like a bomb had exploded in their city and killed everybody. 
>> Over the years, this storm-battered town was in that cone of uncertainty many times. Katrina and rita in 2005. Ike in 2008. But the people knew those storms were coming. 
>> The minute it hit the gulf, we went into high gear, but we were prepared to get into high gear. We were able to do that because of the satellites, because of the communication, and because of the warnings we got. 
>> We could be without power for as much as seven to ten days. 
>> The same warnings that came as superstorm sandy raced up the coastline. 
>> People across the eastern seaboard, midatlantic, you need to take this very seriously. 
>> But history might have told a very different story. Just a month before sandy, one of those key g.O.E.S. Satellites that monitors the atlantic and caribbean where sandy was born went down. 

[00:25:50]


>> There was enough uncertainty while we're still in hurricane season that we took the precautionary measure to move the other satellite over. 
>> Perhaps, some experts say, a foreshadowing. Dr. Kevin trenberth of the national center for atmospheric research says noaa got lucky they had a back-up satellite standing by. 
>> If there's a major failure of the satellites, that would be a major disaster and we would be blinded in many respects. We would not be able to see what's going on in the earth's system as well as we can now. 
>> There is concern within a few years that safety net may be gone. Independent research supports and internal memos show noaa has fallen behind because of budget cuts, complicated organization, and flawed management. Of particular concern, the polar satellites that provide so much of the data on hurricanes and the global big picture. The next generation satellite may not be ready by 2016, when the designed life span of the one up there now ends. 
>> If we didn't have satellites to predict the weather, it would be like you driving at night without headlights. Could you do it? Maybe. You'd stay on the road mostly. But you wouldn't be a very good driver. 
>> The effect, startling. Researchers found if they didn't have the data from the u.S. Polar orbiter, the new forecast would have turned sandy out to sea, potentially leaving people little warning. Are we blowing it out of proportion? 
>> The confidence level, the the probability estimate, we would normally manage our constellation to 70% assurance that this satellite is still working at the time I get a new satellite up there. Our projections right now don't give us that confidence interval. It's below that. 
>> So sullivan's team is trying to speed up satellite manufacturing and launch, but at a cost of $1 billion, each one requires five years to build and launch. It's a race against time. 

[00:28:01]


>> We're determined to fulfill the mission, working as fast as we can, we're putting the right people into place. I'm trained as an astronaut. I'm not satisfied until we're back home and the mission is a success. 
>> A crucial mission as climate change threatens to intensify the storms. 
>>> Next, what the polar icecap is telling us about how damaging those storms could be. And later -- 
>> water level is rising. 
>> -- Can we be ready for the next big one? 
>> We have been whistling by the graveyard for too long when it comes to dealing with a major weather event. . testosterone. it. How did I know? Well, I didn't really. See, I figured low testosterone would decrease my sex drive... But when I started losing energy and became moody... That's when I had an honest conversation with my doctor. We discussed all the symptoms... Then he gave me some blood tests. Showed it was low t. That's it. It was a number -- not just me. 
[ Male Announcer ] TODAY, MEN WITH LOW T Have androgel 1.62% (testosterone gel). The #1 prescribed topical testosterone replacement therapy, increases testosterone when used daily. Women and children should avoid contact with application sites. Discontinue androgel and call your doctor if you see unexpected signs of early puberty in a child, or signs in a woman, which may include changes in body hair or a large increase in acne, possibly due to accidental exposure. Men with breast cancer or who have or might have prostate cancer, and women who are or may become pregnant or are breastfeeding, should not use androgel. Serious side effects include worsening of an enlarged prostate, possible increased risk of prostate cancer, lower sperm count, swelling of ankles, feet, or body, enlarged or painful breasts, problems breathing during sleep, and blood clots in the legs. Tell your doctor about your medical conditions and medications, especially insulin, corticosteroids, or medicines to decrease blood clotting. So...What do men do when a number's too low? Turn it up!

>>> Thousands of miles beneath the weather satellites, in one of the most remote places in the world, lie vital clues about the planet's future. Greenland's arctic ice field is a vast and beautiful piece of nature. It's the second largest ice mass in the world, but it's also very vulnerable to environmental effects like temperature changes. We're taking part in a research mission that's trying to better un the processes that e at play to more accurately predict how fast the ice here is melting. Greenland's ice masses are more than twice the size of texas. This frozen wonderland is constantly in motion. A recent study found this arctic ice shield is losing mass at an alarming rate, close to 300 square kilometers, or about 115 square miles, each year. Some fear greenland's ice might disappear altogether. If that happened, global sea levels would rise seven meters, or about 23 feet. To survey the ice, scientists use one of the most advanced research aircraft in the world, polar 6. Its operational base in greenland is at kangerlussuaq, north of the arctic circle. A former american military base and the territory's largest airfield. E project's ader daniel steinhage and his crew are gearing up for their first survey flight over the massive ice shield. Missions like this one can take more than six hours and lead halfway across the greenland ice sheet. They need to be planned and executed absolutely precisely to make sure the scientists get exact readouts. We reached the glaciers on the fringes of the inland ice, and the arctic's summer's melt is clearly visible. Clear blue melt water ponds dot the landscape, growing as the sun shines on the ice. A research camera installed on the plane's belly also records the images as polar 6 advances towards the radar survey area. Nasa satellite images recently showed unprecedented surface ice melt here, with about 97% of greenland's ice sheet showing signs of thawing. Soe glaciers and melt water ponds disappear and there's nothing below but ice. It's almost impossible to distinguish the clouds from the ground. 

[00:36:34]


>> We're getting very close to the area of operations right now. It's right in the heart of greenland, and the ice sheet at that area is up to two miles thick. The scientists turn their equipment on and beghe survey. Our route takes us to the center of the inland ice. He's getting his first readout. Tell me what we're seeing here. 
>> This is surface reflection. 
>> The arctic is something like an archive of the earth's climate. In its layers, much like in the rings of trees, researchers can find information on temperatures, the amount of precipitation, dust particles, and ash from volcanic eruptions dating back 100,000 years. After several hours in the air, polar 6 makes its way back to kangerlussuaq airfield. It will take months to evaluate the data from these flights. 
>> If we can explain the past, what happens there, then we can use the same programs to run it forward to see what the future will bring us. Then we have scenarios where we have changes in temperature in moisture distribution and all these things. 
>> What these scientists are seeing is that greenland's ice sheet is vanishing quickly. A fact confirmed by the 2012 noaa arctic report card. The report reveals an unprecedented loss of summer sea ice and record melting of greenland's ice sheet. To understand why, polar 6 lands at another site six weeks later. They drill deep into thousands of years' worth of ice. Soon, the first ice cores emerge. Long before the official lab analysis, one scientist can identify some unique patterns even with his naked eye. 
>> What we can see here definitely are prominent melt layers, so they are so prominent, I have never seen them so far. And steff, who was here 30 years ago, he doesn't remember any melt layers at that time. We had one or two centimeter thick melt layers, and they indicate that we had extremely warm summers here. 

[00:38:50]


>> The ice cores are essentially compressed snow that fell here over tens of thousands of years. Each layer holds a record of the climate in a certain era. The further down they drill, the further they go back in time. One of those taking part in the drilling mission is trevor popp, a climatologist from the university in copenhagen. 
>> These ice cores in greenland tell us basically the past climate,t the ice can record. And this is stuff like temperature, the amount of precipitation, the seasonal precipitation, dust impurities in the atmosphere, and importantly changes from year to year that you might see. 
>> By studying how quickly, how often, and why temperatures change in the past, scientists can better understand how our climate is evolving today. For now, one thing seems clear, melting ice and rising sea levels increase the potential of a damaging storm surge, and that can be catastrophic. Especially when it comes to a storm like hurricane katrina. What did the death and devastation teach us, and are we ready for the huge storms ahead?

>>> August 2005. Hurricane katrina smashes into the gulf coast. 1,800 dead, $100 billion in damage, the most catastrophic disaster in recent u.S. History. Caused by a storm surge that could have been stopped. 
>> After the storm, I came by to patrol this area in a boat, and the water was actually over that gutter line. 
>> New orleans police officer steve fox lost everything when the 17th street canal collapsed. 
>> Water as far as the eye can see. Neighbors are gone, everything destroyed. You couldn't believe what you were seeing. 
>> Garrett graves couldn't believe it either. The force of these walls collapsing with the wall of water that came down, literally, just blew everything out. It was just a game changer. 
>> Graves is the assistant to louisiana governor bobby jindal, overseeing the state's new hurricane protection plan. 
>> Never forget those images. It's one of the reasons so many people here have such resolve to make sure that we never allow anything like that to happen here again. 
>> Katrina proved new orleans was a disaster waiting to happen. The storm revealed an inadequate and outdated system of levees and flood walls that failed and caused the massive flooding. >>Nk that some of the major flaws in the system were a lack of recognition for the actual strength or power or storm surge associated with a hurricane. In some areas not anticipating that water would truly be up against the top of a levee or the top of a flood wall and putting that much pressure upon the system. 
>> After katrina, new orleans, and the u.S. Congress said never again. Spending $14.5 billion in mostly federal funds to build a fortress around the city. Among its most powerful new weapons, the largest storm surge barrier in the world. Where we are now, is this where the majority of the flooding came through in hurricane katrina? 

[00:46:03]


>> Well over 20 feet of water came surging through this area where we are right now. It just funneled in and rushed into the city of new orleans. 
>> This massive wall is drilled 190 feet into the earth and towering 26 feet above the water. How much stronger are these walls that have been built around here than what was in place before? 
>> Absolutely incomparable. You have about 50 times more steel in this than the eiffel tower. 
>> Where this barrier ends 350 miles of stronger levees and higher flood walls connect, forming a circle around the city and keeping the deadly storm surge out, but this illusion brings its own problems. Essentially, what has been built around the city of new orleans is a wall, it's almost like giant bathtub. 
>> It is, it is. Which causes additional problems, because when you create a bowl, then when you have rainfall from hurricanes or other events, you then potentially fill up that bowl and flood homes a different way. Every time you build these walls, you have to think about how you're going to evacuate the water or pump the water out of the bowl. 
>> To empty the bowl, another epic solution, new orleans built the world's largest water pumping station. 
>> It can pump about 30,000 cubic feet of water per second, which is just extraordinary. So that pumping station can fill an olympic-sized swimming pool in about four and a half seconds. 
>> And there are 76 more pump stations like this, giving new orleans what might be the best hurricane protection system in the country. The people who might move into this neighborhood now, who don't trust this wall, what would you tell them? 
>> I would tell that that this is the safest this area has ever been. You'll never have storm surge against the other side of this wall again. 
>> That promise is what convinced steve fox to return to his lakeview neighborhood and rebuild. 
>> Born and raised, I'll die here. It's my community. I took a stand. Love new orleans, and I knew i was coming back. 

[00:48:08]


>> But fox knows the storms will come back, too, and in case the walls and levees fail again, he built a last line of defense, a hurricane-resistant home. 
>> I can tell you one thing, if the contractor that built my house built those levee, that canal would have never broke. 
>> His new house and his city faced their first test last august, when hurricane isaac brought a storm surge close to the size of katrina's. Grave said the damage could have been catastrophic, but the new infrastructure kept fox's home and the city dry. 
>> When you look at the likelihood of hurricanes hitting this area, no question in my mind that this system's going to pay off multiple times. 
>> What do you think the difference would have been had all of this been in place before hurricane katrina? 
>> I think that the day after hurricane katrina, we would have been going back to work and that we would have been sleeping in our own beds, in our own homes, and we wouldn't have been looking for hundreds of body bags and caskets and planning 1,800 funerals. 
>> It took 1,800 lives and $100 billion to change new orleans. What will it take to change the rest ocountry? salads.

>>> When superstorm sandy hit breezy point, new york, ocean waves crashed on to city streets and rocked houses off their foundations. The only option residents had was to head for higher ground. 
>> They were sitting ducks. There was nothing they could do except run. 
>> How high was the water right here? 
>> The water would be probably six feet above our heads. 
>> Six feet? 
>> Above our heads. 12 feet, say. 
>> Malcolm bowman is an expert on the many dangers of a storm surge hitting new york. Surveying the damage, he reveals that everything we see left by superstorm sandy is a bitter contradiction, apparently inevitable, yet tragically preventible. How do you stop something like that? 
>> You can't stop it except if you're going to build some kind of regional protection system for metro new york. 
>> Bowman leads the storm surge research group at long island's stony brook university. The group promotes a plan called the outer harbor gateway, an elaborate system of barriers and causeways that would virtually flood-proof much of metro new york, all for billions less than the damage caused by sandy. 
>> The barrier itself across the five-mile opening to new york harbor would cost about $13 billion. In addition, the sand berms on both sides, on the sandy hook side and the far rockaways side, would need to be built up for another $5 billion. So for $20 billion, you could have complete protection for new york harbor, including the three major airports. 
>> A $20 billion project that would take decades to complete, compared to the $30-plus billion needed right now to fix new york's storm damage. It's hardly a radical idea or a new one. Similar barriers already exist in stamford, connecticut, and providence, rhode island. Massive barriers are also in operation in europe. 

[00:55:36]


>> People ask me if the dutch can do it, if the russians can do it, why can't we? 
>> Bowman warned of the need for storm barriers years ago, writing in "the new york times" after katrina in 2005. He tried again in 2008 on a climate change panel convened by mayor bloomberg, but no barriers were built. 
>> If barriers and sand dunes had been properly built in the last eight years, none of this would have happened. I've been trying to get this message that this catastrophe was going to happen, and it may happen sooner or later. I feel my middle name is noah, and I've been telling everybody the big flood is coming. We better start building the ark. 
>> But new york isn't the only u.S. City lagging behind in the battle against rising sea levels, and not every problem can be solved by building walls. 
>> So here in boston you have, you know, the problem that so many east coast cities are facing. We built the city on the water. 
>> Steven flynn is a leading advocate for investing big in projects that make the u.S. More resilient to dter. On a scale of one to ten, how prepared are we right now in the northeastern u.S.? 
>> On a scale of one to ten, we're roughly in a three range. 
>> Three? 
>> We have been whistling by the graveyard for too long when it comes to dealing with a major weather event, especially in the northeast. 
>> One place to start, he says, could be power grids and transits systems, critical, yet storm vulnerable infrastructure that gives coastal cities life. 
>> Americans basically have got themselves into thinking that bad events are things that somebody else is supposed to prevent from happening. 
>> Prevent and pay for. Take, for example, the choices now facing the people of breezy point. Did these people have any protection at all? 

[00:57:44]


>> They have no protection at all. What we're looking towards the ocean -- you can't see it, it's behind these grass beds, but it's about a quarter of a mile from us, but it's flat. It's as flat as a football field. 
>> Malcolm bowman says the construction of sand dunes 30 feet high would have been enough to keep breezy point dry, a project that could be a tough sell outside the flood zone. Who is going to pay for this? 
>> Well, people that live here are paying for it in terms of human misery and the tragedy, but if we talk about paying for it in terms of rebuilding and the dollars, where are the dollars going to come from, and are people in the midwest going to want to pay for protecting these privileged few people who are lucky enough to live on the ocean's edge? I don't think so. 
>> Experts, including bowman, say there will be more storms after sandy, each one, he believes, bringing the nation closer to a conclusion he has already reached. 
>> We have to start planning. It's no longer every person for themselves. There's too much at risk. We have to do it. 
>> And it seems new york governor andrew cuomo is coming to that same conclusion. 
>> It's inarguable. There's a changing weather pattern and the time to act is now. 
>> The state will look into multimillion-dollar barriers designed to hold back storm surges. For staten island residents like nick camerada, that kind of protection can't come soon enough. 
>> Now that we don't have a seawall down there or any type of protection down at the water, when I rebuild, what's going to stop the next storm? The real money should be spent on protecting the community from the ocean coming back up. There's nothing to stop the next storm from doing basical the same thing to the community,

=======================================================

A ving. Stay with us for some expert golden globe predictions. 
>>> The next list with sanjay gupta starts right now. 
>>> When it comes to the brain we're kind of in the dark ages. You all guys all brought your ttl pulse generators? The more kids we can get exposed to the neuroscience, they're going to go a little bit further, a little bit further. 
>> It's estimated that 1 billion people around the world are affected by neurological disorders. Diseases like epiley. Alzheimer's, parkinson's, so this week on the next lis, we profile greg gauge, an innovator who is inspiring future generations to study the brain and maybe one day cure those diseases. Gauge is the co-founder of backyard brains, a michigan-based company that teaches high school students neuroscience. Using diy kits and some, well, interesting props. 
>> I thought he was just a little bit buggy. He knew that the marketplace needed these tools to help teach neuroscience. 
>> Hopefully by building these tools, we'll be able to 234r deuce neuroscience in earlier stage and bring neuroscience into the classroom. 
>> Greg insists you don't have to have a ph.D. Or expensive equipment to learn about the brain. 
>> The idea to do that for less than $100 was actually kind of provocative. 
>> We take something that people think are absolutely disgusting and we made it into something that can benefit technology, benefit the world. 
>> Greg elicits that same excitement and curiosity in everyone, including cnn's brooke ballot wynn who got her own close-up look at how this all works. All with the goal of sparking what greg calls a neurorevolution. I'm dr. Sanjay gupta. Welcome to "the next list." 

[00:02:19]


>>> One of the things we say all the time is that we're changing the world. We feel this way very passionately that what we're trying to do is change neuroscience education. I'm greg gage, a neuroscientist and I co-founded backyard brains. 
>> What is backyard brains? 
>> It's a diy neuroscience company. 
>> Do it yourself. 
>> Do it yourself. Bring the science down to the most basic form so that everyone can understand it. We started as a project called the $100 spike. We did that because where we went to school in the lab we had to use expensive equipment. Like our equipment that we were using costs $40,000. It was like a high-end stuff. So we decided you know, can we come up with a way to do this for under $100. We use cockroaches, crickets and worms, things you find in your backyard. So we can do the neuroscience we do in the lab. Because neurons are very well preserved throughout all of the animal kingdoms. We can see neurons in cockroaches that are similar to the neurons in a human. 
>> We're going to try to listen in on how neurons communicate with each other. They use electricity. We're going to do that not on our bodies, but with insects. So I need you -- 
>> with some roaches? 
>> This is like the fear factor episode. 
>> Really good at this. 
>> This guy that was moving fast. 
>> He's starting to slow down. Ain-depth see advertise. >>>In-depth sizing the cockroach. You're going to cut across that coccyx right there. 

[00:04:21]


>> Within the hairs of that living there, the neuron's job is to send information on touch and vibration. So it will send messages up to the brain. Even though we removed the brain from this guy, it's sitting in here in the ice water. These neurons don't know that when something moves, it's going to send the message. So these are just this is radio shack speaker wire that we've soldered to some map pins. 
>> You're very crafty. 
>> We try to keep everything pretty diy based. 
>> One pin there and one pin there. So you can put it in right there. 
>> Perfect. 
>> When we turn on this box, we're going to see the electrical messages as they pass by. 
>> Go ahead and turn it on. 
>> What you're seeing, this is considered the noise floor right here and the things that popping out of it are the actual spikes, happening from one neuron sending its information up to another. You can touch the leg. And you can see the amount of spikes increase. 
>> Why? 
>> When happens inside each of the neurons where the dendrites are. You have different types of ion channels that open. When you're touching the leg and touching the hair, it's pushing the hair to the side. When it pushes the hair to the side, it pushes open the ion channels. It allows the ions that have a charge pass through. It builds up to the point where it cause as spike. That's the exact same thing that's happening inside your brain. 
>> You're a ph.D. In neuroscience, you could be talking to grad students, why come into high schools and junior highs? 
>> Probably the best neuroscientists grad schools are out there are not in neuroscience gratd school, because they didn't get the exposure early enough to know it was a possibility. The idea is keep getting the experiments more and more advanced so they understand what it means to be a neuroscientist. 
>> Coming up, greg turns to the university of michigan to help bring backyard brains to life. 

[00:06:23]


>> I thought he was a little bit left of center. Stnchts we're in downtown ann arbor, a at a community hacker space, where people gather together to share tools, share ideas. This is the birth place of backyard brains. 

[00:09:51]


>> Most of gear was designed in garages. We got a small grant from the university to move into an incubator space. Then we graduated from there and looking for a home and we started, key wam down here to the hacker space. 
>> At the time, he come forward with an idea to spark cockroaches' nervous systems and I thought he was just a little bit left of center. I'm paul kir sh from the university of michigan, I met greg gage and his team from back yard brains, several years ago when he applied for a grant. We insisted that he put together an a feasibility study of his business. Personally, expected him to come back with there's no way this could be successful. They said this could be a viable business and that was about six or seven years ago. They're a vef sustaining business. Their revenue projection where they are right now is exactly where they said they would be years ago. I have to give them a hand, not just for perseverance but for staying on target, staying the plan and sticking to their guns. 
>> Welcome to the all hands active space, the space of backyard brains. The first thing you need to do is build the circuit board. Everything is based upon here. You put the resistors, the capacitors on, the connectors, which go through and amplify the signal. We have three stages of amplification. Which goes out to a speaker that allows you to hear the signal and output ports that plug into students ipads or external speakers so they can see and visualize the signals as well. We need to build enclosures to put the circuit boards in that protect them. We'll take the raw material, acrylic that we use in sheets. That we're going to use a laser and cut them into parts ha look like this. On the front of the boards we have our logo. On the back of the boards we say we're design and manufactured in ann arbor, michigan. When we started the company it was a down time for michigan, all the automotive industry was in bankruptcy. So we tried very hard to keep all of the development and the engineering and the building all done here in michigan. So we found suppliers that were doing pcb boards for the automotive industry that were down on work, building all the boxes for us, all the people in the community started helping us do it. We try to keep everything within the state of michigan or the midwest. Once the circuit boards are built and we have the enclosure, we do a final assembly. We put the acrylic on the top and sandwich these together and it's good to go. 

[00:12:35]


>> You're so passionate about being here and giving back to michigan and detroit specifically. Why? 
>> Detroit is a great city. And the education system has been under a bit of attack lately. I see detroit in the next ten to 15 years really rebounding and i think it's going to start from the education. We take on lots of young students, sort of like mentor them to become scientists. That's the biggest difference we see between ourselves and the students is not that they're no less smart, but they give up a lot easier. If things don't work right, they'll tend to stop. One of the things we learn as scientists, you keep trying. 
>> Up next, greg's passion for the brain and bugs rubs off on the whole family. 
>> One of the gifts he had given ben was one of the boxes of the cockroaches, next time we went out to the garage, the lid to the cockroaches was open with no cockroaches in there. 
>> I freaked out.?????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????? ???????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????? 

[00:16:55]


>>> when you're in grad school, you get to take electives, one of the electives I took was to learn how to play the bell tower. ???????????? ???????????? I was able to sight-read some simple music. You would practice on a small carolan that had tiny bells, but it had the same shape and everything. 
>> I think our whole family is a little bit driven. And it was not really a competition thing. My sisters and I have a really, really good relationship. 
>> I always think of greg as the absent-minded professor. Bombs could be going off around him. He wouldn't notice. 
>> When I was a kid, I used to take things apart. I was always kind of fascinated with how things work. 
>> I would hook everything together electrically. 
>> On the computer, to the vcr. 
>> Computer, screen, hooked up to the tv. 
>> Apple 2 e just came out. Copied the program, coded it in there and got this thing to work. Well that wasn't good enough for greg. He printed out the program, picked up the individual code and he wrote a program that i could then print envelopes. 
>> I would make little programs that would print out envelopes for my dad or one that would randomize chores. Dishes. Both my mom and dad would pay me and I remember thinking at the time, I was ripping them off. Because it was, it was kind of easy to do. But they kept trying to encourage me. I've never really liked to do the things that people are supposed to do. Like when I started to move up in my career as an engineer, i decided to quit my job and move to europe. And I quit that to become a scientist. And then I went through my ph.D. And I got to the end of my ph.D. And I was supposed to go on to grad school and I quit that and started a company. I like the uncertainty of the future. 
>> The real question is why a cockroach? 
>> He doesn't always swim with the pack. And he doesn't really want to swim with the pack. I'm darrell kipky. A professor of biomedical engineering at the university of michigan. Greg found his way to my lab and I was just received a big research grant from darpa. I didn't know him well. He basically wouldn't leave. He wouldn't allow me to tell him no. And he kept saying -- I'm your guy, darrell. After a while, he just basically wore me down and I made a decision kind of on the spot, this guy has the spark. With that little opening, I was able to convince him that this was a good opportunity and actually it worked out really well. We had a number of crazy ideas that we would try. And they would always sort of end up in some type of a public indication. The newest idea we had was to come up with the $100 spike. The idea was can you take all the equipment that we had, that cost darrell like $40,000, and reduce it down to the most simplest thing that you could actually record a neuron for under $100. 

[00:20:03]


>> To really unlock the secrets of the brain, requires a state-of-the-art technology. There's a certain cost associated with that. They made the first one out of wood and paper clips. Kind of blew me away. 
>> So we wrote the business plan for the competition that we entered. We won the small amount of money. We used the money to buy the wing nuts that we needed to build the first manipulators and circuits, and we kept growing from there. 
>> We like to pick out ideas that are innovative. Something that hasn't been done before. Backyard brains in this particular application received $200,000 roughly. A year for two years. I'm tom inchesle, the director of the national institute of mental health. 
>> When makes this different from a lot of other things that people study in science is there's not really a chance to get engaged on this in high school. Greg says we have to figure out a way to get younger people with some really cool ideas interested in being able to probe the nervous system to figure out how it works. 
>> See the light? On each downbeat it will tap. I'm ben robbins and my godfather is greg gage. What happens is when the ipod sends out the music to the earplugs. Actually the same frequency that our brain uses to move around our arms like I am right now. He came to my class one time and did this. And I thought -- that's really cool. 
>> He actually presented to his sixth grade class and then from there he went to the society for neuroscience. 
>> What is the brain? 
>> My godson, oh yeah, I'm proud. We're going to have a couple of papers together. I see in the future what greg has been able to do. With backyard brains is pretty amazing, bring it down to a level that's very understandable. 
>> We think that in the next few years we're going to see more and more of this adoption in high schools and actually from fifth grade on up. Starting to see the neuroscience revolution beginning to happen. Which is really exciting for us. 

[00:22:10]


>>> When we return, greg takes his show on the road. Bringing spiker boxes and roaches to inner city schools in detroit. 

[00:25:05]


>>> Welcome "the next list." What used it take a room full of expensive equipment to studied brain can now fit in the palm of your hand. After downloading greg's backyard brain app to my ipad,ky actually see th electrical impulses or spikes of my muscles at rest and during contraction. It's a remarkable way to see the brain at work. Now watch what happens when these kids at cass high school in detroit put the spiker box to the test. 
>> What we're going to learn about today is that the brain is an electrical organ, it uses electricity. The first experiment we're going to do is not going to be using our brain, is using the brain of these guys right here. How many neurons do you think a cockroach has? Four neurons? Actually they have one million neurons. So they have slightly thaes number of nirns than we do but you know, thesys are fast. They're a lot faster than they are in my lab. We're going to be able to record from those neurons, because the neuron is going to send an axon which is going to go up to the brain and we're going to be able to pce some pins in there and record that. 
>> Now pause it. Do it again. 
>> All right. This is how it works. 
>> I think teachers don't have the confidence to actually do hands on neuroscience activities, there's like a hesitation to do that. Because it is a difficult field. So we're trying to make the tolls like simple enough that you can do it. Sose things people are already familiar with, cell phones or laptops and then our equipment has one button. You just turn it on. 

[00:27:06]


>> Everything dr. Gage was telling them, they've never seen it in action, we're going to see how we can get some of these kits so we can use this. 
>> This is brand-new stuff this is allows us to do neuroscience with the actual human being. We just made it so you can actually have pads, put into your muscles and record the electricity that's coming from your brain down to your axons on to your muscle and record that voltage, it's pretty neat. 
>> I never knew our muscle would respond intensely like this. 
>> Enlightened by the neuroscience, I've been enlightened, you get a better understanding of muscles and brains. 
>> To know that you can experiment with these specific products, it's amazing. We pick something that people think are absolutely disgusting and we made it into something that can benefit technology. Benefit the world. 
>> These guys were like, I was shocked, I continue to be amazed by how creative kids are. You got to listen to them. A student named mohammed came up with an idea that instead of just recording the emg from a muscle. You could have two kids recording their muscles and have arm wrestling and the winner is not who falls over but who has the biggest spike. 
>> What's the largest compliment a student could give you? 
>> A student said I was thinking about going into nursing, now I'm thinking about going into a neuroscientist. She's now thinking about going into this for a career. 
>> We're in a number of universities, we want to see the amateurs kind of grow. 
>> Once this is in every classroom across the country, what's next? 
>> Who knows what's next. 
>> Maybe a career in politic the would be kind of fun. It would be nice challenge to work on. Right now I'm focused on getting this project off the ground. The scientific way of thinking is it's a beautiful thing. You have to have data in order to make your claims of it. I think a lot of it is missing in politics. 

[00:29:15]


>> So before you become a congressman, today, sitting here right now do you feel like you've changed the world just a little? 
>> Maybe just today with these classrooms. Like the feedback we got from the kids is saying we've increased their awareness of neuroscience. But I'm greedy, we want that across all the country. We don't want just one kid, we want every kid. 
>> Greg says neuroscice in high schools is just the launching point. Last year he and backyard brains received a fellow ship for start-up chile. They inlisted greg to bring his low-cost science gear to high schools and universities and research labs in south america. Pretty exciting stuff.

To tackle the most dangerous quest of their lives. Let's sit on that couch. 
???   ??????
They're in. 

[00:02:13]


And in retrospect, city officials regret holding the gang truce negotiations at Santa's Village. In other news, we're about to go live to Mr. Burns' announcement of his annual rate hike. Springfielders are about to find out how much their electricity bills will go up. I'm being told that Mr. Burns is approaching the lectern now. Apparently there are a few stairs he's struggling to climb. He's up the stairs but is now being buffeted by the breeze. And they've put some rocks in his pocket and... we're ready to go. To decide how much your electricity bills will rise, I've assembled a team of distinguished economists and placed plausible rate hike percentages on their backs. Now we will use unfettered free market principles to arrive at a number. Release the hounds. (dogs growling, people shouting) Notice how the Keynesians climb trees while the Austrian school economists hide under rocks. That is fascinating. And there you have it, folks, rates will rise a healthy 17%. And now, to help you disperse... Let me guess, you're going to release the hounds again. (chuckling): Oh, don't be silly. Release the radioactive steam. (screaming) Electricity costs are going up 17%. (laughing): This station can't afford that. We're barely keeping the lights on as it is. I know it's a kid's show, but I got to see you topless. This isn't your dressing room. I know, but the monkey's got a girl in mydressing room. The decision to pull the plug is never easy. Particularly with the 17% rate hike. Do I get a vote? That's just air escaping his lungs. Oh, I guess we'll be peeling our shrimp by hand this year. We can keep the shrimp de-veiner, though, right? I'm afraid not. 

[00:04:13]


And this goes, too. When I found out shrimp cocktails had no alcohol, I really lost interest. Children, we can no longer afford to use anything electric. However, we will still be able to watch today's film, thanks to the magic of potato power. NARRATOR: Sometimes Y:the story of a vowel that goes both ways. (losing power) Emergency meeting in the faculty lounge. BYOB. Well, class, I don't mind leaving you, because one of you is my spy. You said you weren't going to tell. Oh, wait, you didn't. So no one knows who the Milhouse is. The school is broke. I had to sell all the trombone mutes. (wah-wah) (groans) Why did I sell one to Nelson? (wah-wah) Hmm. Sounds better than half the kids in the band. So does a leaf blower. Look, the district can't afford to keep every school open, so all the kids will take a standardized test. Whichever school scores the lowest will be closed forever. So you're saying, if ours don't pass this test, you're shutting down Springfield Elementary? I don't teach to the test. I teach 'em to dodge balls. Things they can use in life. How is that useful? Ow. We all came here to avoid scrutiny. Who else would hire a lunch lady accused of poisoning her husband? Never convicted. They couldn't find the body. Anyone care for some chicken-Pete pie? Did you say "chicken-Pete pie"? His friends called him Pete. Good-bye, my electrical friends. I can't afford to use you, so I'm doing what any good American would do: throw you away. (gasps) (gasps) And it still works. This could come in handy. Ah, ah, ah, but let me check that list of things Marge said never to bring home. 

[00:06:13]


Dogs, cats, octopuses, octopi, octopuseseseses. Parking meter, you're working for me now. Mannequin heads, you're working for me now. Lot of people at the dump today. The proctors are here. Their leader seems to be a woman. Catalog poses. ("HalloweenMain Theme" by John Carpenter playing) (sighs) When will they finish grading those tests? I hate waiting; that's why I hate risotto. Even mushroom risotto? What do you think?! So... (chuckles nervously) ...how'd we do? Not as bad as the worst school in the state. Oh, thank God. You did worsethan the worst school in the state, which now makes this school the worst school in the state. Why did you say that to us in the meanest way you could? To show you that there's no way out. Except... Except what? No, I meant you should acceptyour terrible fate. Oh. call. She said, "I haven't done my taxes for a few years." What's a few? She said, "I think it's eight." She showed up with four file boxes of paperwork. "Here, take my stuff and figure it out." I will do that for you. It's a mental challenge. It's a puzzle. But getting you the maximum refund- that's what I'm here for.

But does that work for a car? Ask Scott Makowski. He and his team set out to combine power and fuel efficiency. People said it wouldn't work out. People were wrong. Here's proof.

This place is worse than the elementary school in prison. This student filled in everything butthe ovals. In art school he'd be a genius. This isn't an art school. We tried to have ourselves accredited as one, but no one here could, uh, draw the pirate. Children, Groundskeeper Willie will direct you to your new school district. Any correlation to your talents, needs, or friends is completely coincidental. Sherri, you're going to West Ogdenville. Terri, North Haverbrook. But we've never been separated. I'm not sure we can even live apart. Stop your whinging. It's not like you're losing a rake or a backhoe. Nelson, you're off to Arkham Elementary School for the Criminally Insane. (whistling) Well, I'm glad you're not upset. All my extra credit points are like frequent flyer miles on a bankrupt airline. Hey, don't blame me. I didn't even take the test. You didn't? Is there no limit to your disrespect? Eh, I had something better to do. (laughing) Driving you crazy instead of pulling off your legs. 

[00:12:18]


I've really matured. Wait a minute. If you take the test now, your score could raise the average and save the school. Proctor Clarkson, one student still hasn't taken the test. (gasping) Let it be Martin, let it be Martin. It's Bart. (all groaning) I have an aunt named Hope. Perhaps you'd like to kill her as well. Bart will take his exam first thing tomorrow morning. Bart, I'm begging you to try and study. When I think begging, I don't imagine someone standing up. Sorry, I can't grant a favor toomeone I don't respect anymore. You can spin in my chair! Whee! Spinner! Slow down. (chuckles) Well, sure the Lord wouldn't have placed his meter there if he didn't want me to park. This is the easiest money I've ever made. Lugging around a 90-pound parking meter. It's not that kind. All right, now to drag the meter to the next idiot. Oh, God, my back. (laughing) Suckers. Oh, my disks are grinding. (laughing) Easy money. (grunting) 
??? Ch-Ch-Ch-Ch-Changes    Turn and face e strange ch-ch-changes     Don't wanna be a richer man     Ch-Ch-Ch-Ch-Changes     Turn and face the strange ch-ch-changes.    ??????

Nothing a few George Washingtons won't solve. (grunts) Now, to sleep the sleep of the just. (sighs) (humming) Godspeed, old chum. Pass the test and your lunch money is your I'm a kid you've never seen, and I speak for all the kids you've never seen. Do it, man, or you'll never see us again. Principal Skinner, could you help me sharpen this pencil? I guess a little circular grinding might relax me. I can't do this. I'm not ready. You really didn't study? Well, I slept on my books, so I might have gotten something through osmosis. So, you know what osmosis is? Uh, pajamas? Let me make this crystal clear to you, Simpson. If you don't pass this test, it will destroy the school. (laughing)

Our entire school riding on that coffee can head of yours. We've got to get you more time to study. But how? Pull the fire alarm. I'd do it, but everyone's looking at me. What to do, what to do? Don't do it, Seymour. You've never broken school rules. Ever. You wimp. (alarm ringing) Children, remain calm, find your disaster buddy, which is different from your lab partner but may be the same as your lunchroom buddy. Bart: Well, well, well... Looks like Mr. Vanilla just grew some chocolate chips. Save your analogies for the analogy portion of the exam. I bought you time, boy. Don't blow it. I won't. I'm going to ignore everything else on my schedule. Pass this test and the eggs are on me. They will be, Seymour. They will be. (laughing) I'm king of the bus station. Meter, meter, quarter cheater? A rogue parking meter has been terrorizing the streets. Experts estimate the cost to taxpayers at north of $50. That's right, Kent. The entire force is on the lookout for anyone with an excessive amount of change. Our top criminologists have a theory as to what the suspect just might look like. But, of course, that question mark could be an exclamation point or an interrobang. And the man or woman could be Hispanic or, most frightening, contain no punctuation at all. So, how's the studying going? When I start I'll tell you. This is the most selfish thing you've ever done. You're letting your friends go hang because you are lazy and selfish and, hey, are you falling asleep just to spite me? 

[00:21:26]


Hey, why aren't you eating that? There's four of us and eight slices. We don't know how to divide it. Something Stu forgot the music he loves. Mrs. Krabappel? Are you a teacher of the night? Ha, I wish I was a hooker. No one in this town has any money. But the worst thing is what's happened to the school. No, no! (all grumbling) (groans) What have I done? Spinach farm, huh? That's right, you talk in your sleep. Lisa, I want to pass that test. But I need your help. I have all sorts of problems: Lack of attention, I'm afraid of ovals, I only know 24 letters. Don't you fall asleep on me. Excuse me, you're that proctor that's shutting down my children's school. I don't shut anything down. People cut their own heads, and I just tip 'em the basket. You've been in public education a long time, haven't you? (grunting) Freeze, Jack Nickel-scum. Wha...? You know what they do to parking meter thieves in prison? They probably treat 'em pretty well. But when you get out, you're not eligible for jury duty. Which, again, sounds pretty good. Eat silver, copper. D'oh! (tires screeching) Stay with me, man. Stay with me. No, no! You're the first successful business I've ever run. It's hopeless. I can't make up for ten years of goofing off in one day. I need two days. 

[00:23:26]


Look, the thing is, it's more important to know how to take a test than knowing what's on it. So do the ones you know first. If you don't know one, guess "B" and move on. Now, what is the capital of Massachusetts? Uh, "B"? Very good. augmentation initiated. Vision expanding to a 5-inch 1080p HD display and camera. Touch acquiring NFC. Hearing evolving with Beats Audio. Wireless charging activated. Introducing DROID DNA by HTC. It's not an upgrade to your phone. It's an upgrade to yourself. turkeytopia subway. Is that even a word?

[00:26:32]


(ticking) Bart: Okay, this is it. Do or die. D'oh. Will you stop that? Burly Paper Towels, Burlyville, Minnesota. Dear Sir or Madam: Your paper towel packets promised 102 sheets of towels. But I was blessed to receive 103. I'm returning the extra towel, unused... (jingling) Hmm? A pillow case full of quarters? Where did you get that money? And what have you done with the pillows? The pillows are safe at my workstation. As for the quarters, well, I'm ashamed to tell you what I did. How long have you been in there? Well, we're going to turn this change into change for the better. Whoo-hoo! And I wish that Mr. Teeny gets a banana, that the Isotopes emerge from this season with a great blooper reel. I wish that wishing wells worked so I wasn't tossing my money away and that Marge loves me forever no matter what stupid things I do. (grunts) (splash) And I hope Bart passes his test and saves the school. Way to get us back on topic, Marge. If you have to guess, guess "B." Not every question! The second that boy fails, we're knocking down this school. Please have a little faith. I hear you, Seymour. Start the upswing! The least common blood type is A) b, b) a, c) ab, D) O... d'oh! Ten more seconds. ("HalloweenMain Theme" by John Carpenter playing) 

[00:28:37]


And the last answer, "C." Is correct. Congratulations, you made it by one. That'll do, bug, that'll do. ("SupermanTheme" by John Williams playing) He passed. Stop that ball! Now your mom can see you work from her house. Seymour, stop slouching! I'm not sure if you gave my son any extra help, but if you did, thank you. Perhaps this was a test of my humanity. A test I like to think I passed. Would you like to have coffee or dinner, or just talk? None of the above. Testward ho! (Beethoven's "Symphony No. 6" playing) (wind blowing) (growls) Is this Wilson Elementary? No. Sorry. Captioning sponsored by 20th century fox television

Hey, Simpson. How come you ain't in combat like a real man? I'm too fat to fit in a foxhole. (laughter) Kids, remember when I promised to feed us from that victory garden? Well, instead, I grew this tree. Don't dare bring that thing in here. What? You don't want a Christmas tree? That's crazy. Next you won't want a Christmas ham. Don't worry about that. I love meat and I always will. Mm-mm! That is some sweet pig meat. But as for Christmas trees, I used to love them, until last year... This tree reminds me of your father.

>> Funding for "to the contrary" provided by: The cornell douglas foundation committed to encouraging stewardship of the environment, land conservation, watershed protection and eliminating harmful chemicals. Additional funding provided by: The colcom foundation. The wallace genetic foundation and by the charles a. Frueauff foundation. 
>> This week on "to the contrary" first, women and minorities are missing in obama's inner circle. Then, women are binge drinking more. 
Behind the headlines: The country's newest female 
governor: New hampshire's maggie hassan. 
>> Hello, I'm bonnie erbe. Welcome to "to the contrary," a discussion of news and social trends from diverse perspectives. Up first, cabinet concerns. President obama is catching flak for his first few cabinet nominations for his second term 
-- that for leaving out women and persons of color, especially after women voters secured his victory in last fall's election. Although president obama wanted to nominate susan rice as secretary of state to replace hillary clinton, so far he's apinted men to head up the departments of state, treasury, and defense. And the high-profile position of cia director also went to a male. Long time friend of this show, h,lda salis surprised everyone by announcing her resignation this week. Do would care how many women and women of color in the cabinet. 

[00:02:25]


>> The diversity of this nation. This is a president that said that that is important to him, he's lived up to it I believe he will do it in terms of his second. 
>> I think mitt romney has an opportunity to bring over his binder of women and hand it over to president obama which we've heard has had hostile environment in the white house. 
>> I think the bottom line is, he did fairly good job the first time, he hasn't delivered yet. He needs to. Diversity at the highest level of government is going to deliver better results and better electoral and outcomes, what is he waiting for. 
>> I don't know where to begin quite frankly. Because president obama ran one of the most divisive campaigns in recent memory. Did he it to divide and conquer the electorate. He got over -- 55% of the women vote. And what does he give his electorate for electing him a second term? I'm going to appoint all white men to cabinets of really importance, defense secretary, cia, I'm missing one and state. And ruth markus, she writes for the "washington post" this is first time in 16 years we won't have secretary of state of color or who is a woman. I think for this president i think it's funny because ruth went on to say it's almost like mad men on tear steroids. They -- and president is only face of diversity. 
>> I think it -- wait, let me just -- that everybody -- 
>> I know but everybody -- come on legs be fair. I was on the show where you guys couldn't stop mocking mitt romney -- 
>> hold on. 
>> For asking for binders of women. 
>> This whole binder of women was blown out of proportion. Now what happened, everybody blew it up. What happened is mass gap were the ones behind the binder full of women. What they did -- 

[00:04:29]


>> let's got get in to that I do want to raise the point that what seems so effortless really in pulling together his first cabinet which included lots of women and persons of color in high positions. It has completely gone out the window this time. It's kind of like, you know, I'm in office now for -- I can't run again. The heck with you guys and everybody says time to make it up. No, he does not. 
>> Because the -- 
>> because the three fop jobs are gone and ability to make history is pretty much gone. They're talking about a woman in congress, how many female commerce secretaries going back to barbara franklin and the post nixon era. 
>> Again we have to go back to the fact that we have seen that these unnamed women officials have come out said president has a woman problem where his circle, inner circle, they're men. And they did the whole -- that's just not enough. There is fundamental problem here that he needs to address and should take the opportunity to put more -- 
>> we totally agree with that on this side of the table. The thing that is representative I think is that it's an anomaly, his first term was an tea anomaly we all assumed everything ever r was going to be fine. Year of the one, 1992, historic number. We are on board, man, we thought organically the problem would solve itself, wrong. What we have to have is this deliberate concert effort to have always have women and diversity or just doesn't happen. 
>> Let's look at the numbers. The numbers are that throughout first administration 42% of the appointees were women. Roughly to -- 
>> in the cabinet? 
>> Broadly speaking his appointments that includes -- roughly same under clinton administration, 10% more than under the bush administration. Let me finish. All these people who are arguing that first initial high level appointments are white men, I do agree, I think he can do better than that moving forward. The fact of the matter is for some of these people take with it a grain of salt, I feel like crocodile tears. They were the same people hurling insulting and horrible indictments of susan wright within she was first quoted as secretary of state. Now at the same time that they were hurling these attacks towards them we would love kerry, guess what, white male. Which one do you want. 

[00:07:01]


>> Answer that. The attacks are coming from democrats particularly democrat women I your party, they're not coming -- 
>> who? 
>> Let me finish. You said that president's first term was anomaly, I don't know what you mean by that because he was the first black president elected of the united states of america, a keen awareness and sensitivity to the fact that diversity, his diversity and diversity of the american people got him elected the first term and second term. Wait a minute -- wait a minute, I just want to put a little bow around this. To say to bonnie's point it looks to everybody particularly women who were outraged in the democrat party that the president saying, hey, women, i know I gave you julia, I made a lot of promises that we were going to take care of from you cradle to grave but I don't care. I think charlie wrangle said, if -- 
>> let me explain. When I said anomaly that high rate of diversity in his cabinet. We have to remember whether it's obama or bush, right? That everything that's wired against women and we saw it beautifully or terribly in the susan rice situation. It is sexist, what she went through was sectionist beginning to end of story. 
>> Poor judgment. 
>> I disagree. 
>> The groundwater in this country, ranked 95th in the world. Our groundwater is sexist is wired against women's ascension in leadership. 
>> I'd like to go back to that inner circle working in the white house I can tell you when president bush was there he had condoleezza rice, karen hughes, harriet miers, he was suffer sounded by these -- surrounded by the women. That is who the president meets with every day. You can have lower political appointee, is that is great. But we should have more women and hispanics and african americans, but that inner circle that is -- those are folks that influence the president. Those peopl surrounding the president, white men. 
>> But closest adviser is -- 
>> I agree. There will be more. 

[00:09:03]


>> Wait a second. 
>> I do want to talk to you about that. There will be more. He had a chance, female secretary of defense or treasury, never been one before. And everybody inside and outside washington knows treasury, defense and state are really the only cabinets that matter. Since he's already made those appointments, at least put the names up, can he really make it up? From where I sit he can't. 
>> Those are the -- if you want to consider the holy grail, you can say they're the holy grail but not only cabinet positions. We have labor that we have to replace. We know that -- 
>> which is -- which is how the -- with which a -- excuse, which female labor secretary since president roosevelt first nominated first female to that office. 
>> We still need another one. That's what I would argue. In this country we need to make sure we have representation. I agree. This country has a diversity and leadership at the highest levels of this government, fact is up to us to push our leaders to make sure that that is the case. 
>> That's what we're doing here. 
>> Also don't just want women, blacks or anybody given positions because of the color of their skin or gender. 
>> No, no. 
>> Wait. 
>> That's -- 
>> are we not past dash da. 
>> No, we're not actually because the democrats run a campaign of identity and -- 
>> you don't have to be -- 
>> I think the -- 
>> one at a time. 
>> Let's put the -- 
>> you would agree to that. 
>> Let's just put -- 
>> I would agree -- 
>> that white men are not -- 
>> nobody else talk. Let's put the partisan gauntlet down and say we as women all agree obama could have done a lot better. And that's what our nations need. Needs diversity in highest offices. 

[00:11:03]


>> Let us know what you think. Please follow me on twitter @bonnieerbe. From women in government to women's health. Binge drinking, often thought of as an issue for men, is an under-recognized problem for u.S. Women. According to a new government study, 14 million women or 13% binge drink. Among high school girls, the figure is closer to 20%. Binge drinking is defined for women as four or more drinks on one occasion. Women binge an average of three times a month. Experts believe the increase is in part due to marketing strategies including flavored alcoholibeverages. Binge drinking is more common among non-hispanic whites and becomes more common as household income rises. 
>> How concerned should we be? 
>> Very concerned. What I admire about center for disease control's authors of this study they said number one thing that we can do, parents can start talking to their kids. Guess what, kids take examples from parents. If they watch their parents drink a lot to excess and get sloppy drunk they're probably going to do it. Also, the study said that most of these kids are getting alcohol from adults in their lives. 
>> I think, bonnie, this goes back -- I sound like an old-fashioned norman rockwell lady. But parenting is always -- one of the keys I'm not saying only one. But sam and I were talking earlier you talk to your kids, there are consequences to bad behavior, drinking is not your friend especially for women. 
>> Absolutely. I have 28-year-old daughter, 26-year-old, first grandchild I'm excited. We dealt with that right when they were at those teenage years. It was real clear in our house, you don't drink. We're not the strictest household in the world but the downside of drinking is so profound, especially for girls. At the dinner table when they got to be of age there is wine at the table. We'd drink at the table. Other thing that research shows is that girls and boys that grow up in households where you readily sit down to the dinner table together as a family have much lower rates of these kind of behaviors. I agree with you 100%. 

[00:13:22]


>> As mother of five girls I am incredibly panicked by this. But it really is a serious issue that needs to be dealt with. I think I wish that they could get video cameras, they did this in the documentary, capture these girls all passed out, drunk and stupid and show it to these girls. Say, look at you, you can die. You can get -- 
>> or get in a position you don't want to be in. You lose self control. You lose the importance of who you are. Part of that is teaching -- not only parents but teachers being involved in this conversation with them about self respect and fact that you want to be in control. You don't want anyone to control you. In that case I think that's an important discussion to have. 
>> This is a lot about peer treasure, a lot about being accepted because everyone else is doing it. We need to teach our young girls to love themselves for themselves. And not necessarily rely on these crutches in order to be accepted. What I find interesting about this particular study is that it really hits segment that one would think advantaged. Affluent girls, white girls, you wonder what in the world is that it they feel this need to put themselves in such danger when you know who is really most impacted by this problem, that should create situation where we start to think what can we do to target that segment to shay we need to make sure these girls love themselves. 
>> You know, part of it, too, is blamed by the report on marketing and coming up with flavored drinks. I'm sorry, but I was a dumb teenager but are there dab -- i wasn't dumb enough to just go out and buy flavored liquor because I saw ads for it. How intellectual are these ads any more? What happened last election with the republicans billions spent on messaging that went no where. 
>> Exactly. I went over to costco in can, it was a pink bottle that said "girl" it was -- it was like liqueur vodka drink. Catches your eye. If they're able -- if they're of age able to buy that why not. 

[00:15:30]


>> Go ahead. I was going to say you have five girls. You said it's about showing young women images of -- do you think this makes you -- we have to focus on messages of empowerment taking charge of your life. I think it's very troubling to your point that one out of five high school girls is bingee drinking. 
>> How do we as a community, i think we're all raising good points, as parents, as mentors, as teachers, I think we should have -- young women should be sat around a table at home, at school, environments like girl scouts and brown he's and say, i want to you watch this video. This isn't pretty, together up -- throwing up, passing out, you can get raped or engage in sexual activity that you're not aware of. 
>> Add the community to that. What is the code word here, white affluent girls, college. My first husband, university college coach, right? I was right involved in that community. When you look at the frat parties, sorority parties that were going on that's where all that have was going on. Talking about those communities, bingo, lot of that. 
>> Behind the headlines: New hampshire made history this year by sending an all female delegation to the 113th congress. This 'matriarchy up north' includes both u.S. Senators, its two representatives and a woman governor. This week, governor maggie hassan shares her story of advocacy and public service with "to the contrary." 
>> I'm from exeter, new hampshire, where I have lived for about 23 years. I have two wonderful children, ben and meg and my husband tom. The kids are now young adults. I am a lawyer; I worked in the area of business law, labor employment law for years. I gradually got involved in advocacy for our family and for my son because ben who is now 24 happens to experience severe physical disability. 

[00:17:31]


>> Hassan's interest in politics is very personal. It dates back to her advocacy work and includes time in the state legislature. 
>> It was a combination of my professional skills as a lawyer and my concern that families like mine and people like my son had advocates for them in our state capital that drew me to public service. One of the great privileges i had was serving as majority leader for the first female majority legislative body in the country's history. And when you go around and talk to the women who serve in our legislature, its often stories about getting involved in a community effort or to advocate for families or something like that, that draws them into public service. 
>> Hassan credits her husband with encouraging her to run for office. But she also had the support of female politicians. 
>> Senator shaheen as governor appointed me to my first public service role which was serving on an education finance committee where I was representing the voices of public school parents. She's the first woman in our country's history to serve as a senator as well as governor. She's a great role model and I'm always happy to take advice from her. 
>> I wouldn't presume to give her advice. I think she ran a great campaign. She's gotten there, I have offered to be helpful in any way I can but I think she's off to a great start. 
>> Now the two women are working together again, one in washington and one in new hampshire. Hassan says it should not come as a surprise that new hampshire is america's first matriarchy. The state legislature, which is an all volunteer body is filled with women. 
>> You have women who have a history of volunteering at the community level, gradually realizing that they want to take what they know and the issues that are of concern to them and their constituents to concord in that role. 
>> This year five women governors will lead their states. Hassan is the lone democrat in that group. As a woman and democrat the governor hopes to bring all sides together. 

[00:19:41]


>> What's most important for us right now is making sure that we have a balanced budget and we have tools to bring educators and bunesses together so we can prepare a skilled workforce for the 21st century economy. New hampshire should be and can be an economic leader. We already are a place with low taxes, low unemployment and stronger than average economy. We want to make it even stronger. 
>> Sam bennett, with the female governor and four female senators in congress women, what can new hampshire do that other states can't do? What kind of power does it give to the women of the state? 
>> This is a story we're particularly proud of, women's campaign fund, we were her first national endorsement we grabbed the rest of the nation kicking and screaming to endorse her. She would have been terrific to make an amazing governor. One might ask why is new hampshire the state that has this all woman delegation? There are research that shows perfectly the story that women run for office because they want to change the world. Men run for office because they see pathway to power. New hampshire has the lowest compensated state legislature in the country. My state, pennsylvania, ranked 47th in the country among all women in elected office. Highest paid state legislature. This is correlation between what they get paid and dominance of men or women in that legislative body. 
>> Very interesting. 
>> Other factor going on additional research shows that there's a twin fact if there is already woman serving the chance that another woman will serve unthat position or another possession goes up exponentially. High number of senatorial bodies where you have twin sets two of women senators. The real story here is one that shaheen told that we as women need to encourage other women to run when we serve in office, we also provide very powerful role modeling. And maggie is going to be a terrific governor. 

[00:21:48]


>> I'm excited. I completely agree with everything sam has said. I know this is a first but -- we're about firsts in all seriousness you were actually right. I think what new hampshire can do for the united states of america and women is I can look in the face of those elected women and say, I can do it. You can do it. You can do it. The power that have image and what you left out I think if I'm right is new hampshire has a speaker of the house I believe, their state legislature who is also a woman. And the woman who is the supreme court justice of the state of new hampshire is a woman. It's like, woman power. To your point, I know your organization has done a lot of research most women when they think about running for office second guess themselves. Right away, I don't have to be qualified. It's a rite of passage. I like the fact that we have bipartisan group of women leading new hampshire and i think it's more power to everybody we should all take a lot of note in that. They were elected by the people of their state. Doesn't mean we're inferior. 
>> How about from your per specktive the four members of the house and senate three democrats then kelly who is pretty hard lined conservative. Are they going to be able to get along do anything. 
>> I think so. Back to sam's point women get engaged because we're moms, we're activists something personal that drives us i believe. I think your research shows that to get involved. Just because kelly might be a conservative, I don't like labels you know of, she's a left winger she's a right winger or whatever. I think that what I've seen from senator is there's a commitment to work across the aisle I think when you deal with women there is just -- I don't know, tenacity and passion to say, let's get this done. 
>> It was during the fiscal cliff negotiations that the women senators both republicans and democrats said, we can do this. These guys are not getting this done. Because we're age -- I think we communicate better to one would the and get a solution. What I love about the governor of new hampshire is -- she is incredibly supported by her husband. Very inspirational not only raising her one daughter, her son with cribral palsy. She's amazing. When she spoke, I want to bring the parties together. What a great lesson for washington. Why can't we get it done right over here. 

[00:24:20]


>> When you look at new hampshire in particular it's very rich and political tradition. These are people that the first primary in the nation, they're very involved, candidates go to the people's houses if we can get people more engaged in the political system. Get moms and women to run it would be a -- 
>> don't forget pay your governors and state legislators lower salaries. All goes to the fact that women are about getting things done. Making a difference in their community, making a difference in the world. The more that we can really support those efforts by donating to women candidates by supporting them, by encouraging all those bright spots that we see in our communities throw their names in the hat. Run for the next office. More we can repcate this idea. 
>> Thank you. Let's point out. If we talk about washington, the gridlock we're all struggling with. Research shows women reach across the aisle and engage in politics in nonpartisan ways that men don't do. 
>> That's it to are this edition "to the contrary." Please follow me on twitter at bonnie erbe and at "to the contrary" and check our website, pbs.Org/ttc where the discussion continues. Whether you agree or think, to the contrary, please join us next time.

You know, public television have been so wonderful to me, an artist like myself, I've tried very hard to get on as many wonderful TV shows that you have in this country and I haven't felt the personal connection like I have with the PBS network. And everywhere I go, now, because I've been played on public television, everywhere I go across America, people say, "We saw you on PBS!" And you know, we have a relathip and it's a wonderful thing. So, yeah. One of my dearest friends is coming up to play some guitar with me now. Ladies and gentlemen, would you welcome the incredible Frank Vignola.

He has a wonderful talent to share with his audience, and many inedible stories as well. Our executive producer of this program, Maura Daly Phinney, had the opportunity to spend some time backstage with Tommy before the show. And to learn a little bit more about his music, his life, and why he feels strongly about performing for the public television audience. Let's hear what he had to say. 
Maura Daly Phinney: As you can see, I'm back with Tommy Emmanuel, and we're in his dressing room backstage, it's been a great show, so far, we've really enjoyedall of it, and uh. It took a lot to put it together though. We've been working on this for. 
Tommy Emmanuel: Oh my goodness, that's for sure. Well, we've been talking about it for so long and planning this, I mean, and PBS, you guys have got such an amazing crew here. You got lighting people, staging people, sound people, well, we've got live sound people out there, we've got people recording everything so the DVD sounds good, so the CD sounds good. And then of course, from my perspective, I wanted to put together the best show with the best guests and everything, and I think this is an incredible opportunity, not just for me, but for my guests as well, to be seen by a lot of new people. There, for a lot of you people out there, my guests are going to be new to you. So it's kind of like, our gift to you, is to bring these incredibly talented people here. 
Maura Daly Phinney: And pbs has a history of doing that, of introducing young artists especially to viewers who haven't seen them before. And from around the world, like Anthony of course, is from your native Australia. 
Tommy Emmanuel: Yeah, that's right. 
Maura Daly Phinney: Yeah, but that's something that we really think is important, so if you think it's important as well, we hope you make an investment in it right now, right?

We hope you're enjoying the performance and more than that, you'll take the opportunity right now to make a contribution of support. More of the music to come and when we do return to this musical performance on public television, you'll see more of those moments, when Tommy Emmanuel really takes it to another level. Takes it to some rarefied spaces where few other musical performers, few other guitar performers are able to go. And not only is he doing it onstage, but he's doing it with a troupe of performers and he's doing it all on television. A great gift that he is sharing with us right now and with his friends.

[00:51:34]


Fred Nahat: Performing for a number of years all over the world, has given Tommy Emmanuel a wide and diverse experience about other people, other cultures, their feelings, their insights. You know, in this program, he tells the tale of a Swahili tribe and their advice to not carry too much weight of the past or worry too much about the future, but live in the moment. Those are the sorts of insights that one gains from a lifelong of traveling around and performing great music. Well, we have some more insights to share from Tommy Emmanuel. Our producer, Maura Daly Phinney got a chance to catch up with Tommy Emmanuel backstage and have a conversation about his life, his music, and his career. Here's Maura. 
Maura Daly Phinney: As you can see, I'm here with Tommy Emmanuel. 
Tommy Emmanuel: Hey. 
Maura Daly Phinney: In his dressing room. 
Tommy Emmanuel: Yes. 
Maura Daly Phinney: Very exciting night here at the Balboa Theatre. 
Tommy Emmanuel: Oh boy, what a beautiful place to play. 
Maura Daly Phinney: It is a beautiful place. And tell me a little bit about how you chose the guests for this program. 
Tommy Emmanuel: Well, the guests, pam rose, is a wonderful singer-songwriter and I heard her album Morpheus, and I fell in love not only with her singing, but with her songwriting. And I've invited her to open for me on some dates here in the U.S., and also in Europe. And people were weeping when she sang. 
Maura Daly Phinney: She has a lovely voice. 
Tommy Emmanuel: She has a gorgeous voice. Anthony Snape is a young singer-songwriter who many years ago sent my manager Gina a Cd with a couple of demos on it, and she rang me, and said, "Hey, you should hear this boy sing." And I said, okay, bring him over, so I had a little, I listened to one song, right, invite him to America. 
Maura Daly Phinney: And he's really from your town? 
Tommy Emmanuel: Yeah, he's from my hometown, of Gunnedah. 
Maura Daly Phinney: Which is not that big, right? 
Tommy Emmanuel: No, well, we used to have a horse. Used to be a one-horse town, but the horse died. But anyway. So we started playing music in that town, and I invited him over, had him open for me. He's not only a great singer-songwriter, he's a very motivated guy. He hag heart, and he really loves to perform for the public and that's what I love about him. Because it's all about the public, it's all about the people and getting them excited and giving them a great show. Frank Vignola and Vinny Raniolo. They are two guys, I met Frank, when he was playing with Les Paul at the Iridium jazz club in New York City. And I was, my jaw was on the ground, the first time I heard him. And I thought, that's the kind of guy I want to be around. You know, if you want to lift your own game, be around someone who forces you to do that. And Frank's one of those guys you know.

=======================================================

>>> Good morning, I'm chris hayes. The country will see more extreme weather. IN THE EAST, HIGHS IN THE 50s. On the west coast, temperatures near freezing and severe storms are threatening the mississippi and ohio river valleys with flooding. And in egypt, a court has ordered a retrial for former president hosni mubarak. I'm joined by msnbc contributor, JOY REED, tara McIis, executive director for american for progress action fun and professor of linguistics and contributing editor at the new republic and columnist at the "new york daily news" and amy goodman, author and, of course, host of "democracy now." 
>>> This week president obama anoupsed three cabinet nominations all white men. The five departures which as of wednesday include hilda solace to our males. The appointments have called into question the president's commitment to diversity in his second term, concerns by a mick kmur in "the new york times" on tuesday, showing president obama last month in the oval office surrounded by his closest advisers discussing fiscal cliff negotiations. 1 of 11 is a woman, valerie jarrett who's leg is barely visible. That picture is not fully illustrative of the president's record. According to the "new york times" 43% of mr. Obama's appointees have been women. That's roughly the same as clinton and one-third more than george w. Bush and he's nominated female judges at twice the rate of president bush and more women, minority and gay judges than any previous president has. On wednesday, white house press secretary jay carney defend tornado president's record. 

[00:02:09]


>> The president's senior staff here is well -- women are well recommended in the president's senior staff here. Two of the three deputies, deputy chiefs of staff are women. The white house council is a woman. A woman runs homeland security for this country. Secretary that nepolitano. The cabinet secretary in charge of the most piece of domestic policy generation is a woman, kathleen sebelius. Look at the record. It's a vast improvement. 
>> I am of two minds about this story. One, ttroling and a little bit of a trap. The photo spoke with such a powerful photo that it ended up sort of dominating the actual content of the art cal that was below the photo which said, look, this is one-third better than previous administration equal can bottom line and deep problems in the pipeline. At the same time, I think also, there's that photo is not nothing. I mean, it says something about what the inner circle is. I'm curious what you guys think about invented issue or real issue? 
>> I think it's important that we're having discussion but i think it way more complicated than the photo. We've had a year of photos and there's another one of a bunch of people to speak in congress about birth control none of whom were women so we're sensitized to this conversation. But fundamentally what's interesting is why we're having it and a little bit deeper about what it means for what comes next. 1 of 3 people who voted in this election were women who voted for obama. We had a discussion about binders of women. We're having this discussion about the cabinet largely because of how we got here. I think the personal matters but what that means for the policy actually would be a much more interesting conversation. 
>> I think part of the reason was -- we'll play a little bit of the binder for women. It became a tag looib after mitt romney told the story in one of the debates. Take a look. 

[00:04:16]


>> I've got to tell you we don't have to collect a bunch of binders to find qualified, talented, driven young women. 
>> The idea to go and ask where a qualified woman was, come to my house. He didn't need a binder. 
>> What does that mean? What does that mean? Why is joe biden hiding qualified women in his house? 
>> What I better than joe biden. 
>> I agree. I'm grad we're talking about it. That photo had about a dozen people in it. The reality is there's 22 members of the cabinet and cabinet-level positions. Eight of them are women. Another five are minority men. So it's not like that photo is exactly representative of the cabinet. That's one thing. And the other thing is the groups that are engaged many the clutching of the pearls on this are number one, republicans, who, come on, seriously, they couldn't even find any women to talk about birth control and they're obsessing over women's reproductive health and the beltway media which is not exactly teeming with women either. So I think it's a little bit of trolling. But, of course, the first term of a president is like freshman year. You have to surround the people that are good for you and the second term is like you're an upper classmen and you pick your roommates and it looks like from the past three highs picking bros, only guys but he's picking three very high-profile positions. Not the whole cabinet. 
>> Generally, I'm a little skeptical of the value of what we these days, call conversations with a capital "c." But in this case I think it's important. 
>> My whole show is founded on the premise of that. 
>> We have to talk about it when we're talking about sensoring somebody for their moral views. If we looked 50 years ago with the obama administration it would be hard to say he had a woman problem. Nevertheless, the fact is, we need to keep in mind especially at this pivotal time extent there's a problem with women, news stories saying women are, perhaps, more reluctant to take jobs that require longer house than we've seen anne marie slaughter article at that. We need to keep that in mind. You and I both, as fathers of young children, see how difficult it can be to do anything @after 5:00 p.M. If you're concerned with a child to the extent that burden falls disproportionately on women and we need to keep having that conversation so I'm glad to see that come up. 

[00:06:56]


>> And we have to talk about diversity of political opinion. On the issue of women, go back to president obama's first term welcome a large group of women, leaders, who were then his cabinet and within the white house, gather with him to say, we may be here but we want to be heard. There was an uprising at the very beginning. And then now, look at who's leaving. Hilda solace, the department of labor, first latino secretary of labor, extremely progressive. Looking at. 
>> Lisa jackson. 
>> Lisa jackson who may well be leaving among other issues, because of keystone excel. We don't know where obama is coming down but the pipeline that would bring dirty oil from canada to the gulf of mexico that goes to the issue of climate change so you're losing not only women but very progressive people and what is replacing them. In the bigger pick kbhur jack lew, jacob lew who very much follows in timothy geithner's footsteps and people are asking serious questions about him and we'll talk about accountability. Looking at john brennan. And what it means for him to headhe cia. The man who came out of the bush administration, identified with they call it enhanced interrogation techniques. One might call it torture. Drone attacks. These are the serious issues that have to be looked at diversity and always. 
>> I think you raise a good point. Which seats women are in. There are three seats with women as treasury secretary, defense secretary and veterans' affairs and back to thatphoto, the fiscal cliff conversation that where women are sitting, the first woman ever appointed, was the labor secretary. We have a good history of women in the labor position. What about treasury secretary and defense? What difference does this make? So where they sit really matters. 
>> One thing this issue brings up so -- the idea of these kind of disingenuous attacks from republicans on this. Which has been interesting to me because I tweeted out the photo of "the times" photo. I had the good fortune of coming up in the world of lefty media that I can't recalling being in a meeting with 11 men and one woman. I don't think as a general rule that's a good idea in any case for anything other than maybe an nfl football team. Like I don't understand why you would have a meeting where that was the case. I tweeted it out and it got retweeted by a bunch of conservatives like, ha, ha, you women of america, you've been punked by the administration. Here's mike huckabee doing his best at this. Take a look. 

[00:09:43]


>> You remember back during the democratic convention how he accused the republicans of waging a war on women? And he made the democratic convention mostly about abortion and free contraceptives. And a lot of women must have believed it because he got 55% of the female vote, mitt romney, 44%. But now a lot of those females who support barack obama are scratching their heads and saying, whoa, how come there's so much testosterone in the obama cabinet and so little estrogen? Give them contraceptives and abortions but don't worry about positions of authority. They shouldn't be asking for such things. 
>> Well, that seems like a fair and reasonable attack. We'll talk about that clip right after we take a break.With multiple lacerations to the wing and a fractured beak. Surgery was successful, but he will be in a cast until it is fully healed, possibly several months. So, if the duck isn't able to work, how will he pay for his living expenses? Aflac. Like his rent and car payments? Aflac. What about gas and groceries? Aflac. Cell phone? Aflac, but I doubt he'll be using his phone for quite a while cause like I said, he has a fractured beak.

>>> John, your response to mike huckabee on estrogen? 
>> I think the main thing i would think of is that unless we think obama was being cynical about this and I'm not aware of anybody that does he did put himself on the line to try to have what would have been in this photograph, a person, susan rice, who is one, black, two, a woman, and three, unrelated to either one of those things, not somebody who has exactly known for the most butter smooth personality in terms of getting along with people. There's a kind of larry summers abrasiveness aspect to her yet the idea was that she would be secretary of state. He meant if that didn't work out but it's hard for me to forget that in terms of what's going on now. So I think it's a ridiculous charge because of rice alone. 

[00:14:30]


>> And by the way, when she was put forward and we don't know if she was the first pick but when she was put forward she was immediately attacked and a25kd in the most debasing terms by PEOPLE LIKE john McCain saying, she's not smart enough and really attacked her in such an ugly way that I think it's ironic that anyone from the party having seen and witnessed and participated in that would turn the charge around on the president. 
>> So there's an interesting question here, I think, which is -- who has standing to make this claim? Which I think ends up being the kind of second beat of the conversation because I've seen people respond to and I think, completely legitimately respond to it by being the white house press core. Hello? Have you seen the white house press core? White men and white men and white men and some women. 
>> The operative word, the first word, the white house press core. 
>> And media broadly is incredibly male and incredibly white. And so the question is -- who has the standing to make the claim? I think people -- there's some kind of understandable resistance to anyone attacking the white house be it seems like it's kind of a cop-out. It's the president of the united states and the diversity of viewpoint and like you said during the break, in terms of people and where they're coming from from a class perspective. 
>> I think it's interesting not only to think about this in the space of cabinet appointments. The business world is woefully behind everywhere. Religious institutions that if we make change in this space we are need to make it across the board. And that it's telling and that there's an interaction of these diffent groups. 
>> Then there's this resistance to how that's done. The keep question is -- okay, if we all say this is a goal and i think there's a broad, social consensus that it should be a goal, the breakdown comes along implementing it, right? You get into this -- I thought this was very interesting interaction of our one of our second producers found. This is back in clinton -- bill clinton facing the exact same kind of charge and railing to andrea mitchell against the bean counters who were, essentially, auditing his diversity record. Take a look. 

[00:16:45]


>> I think a president's staff and, net ought to look like america. I think it ought to look like america. 
>> Today clinton rejected complaints from women's groups that he hadn't delivered. 
>> People doing this talking are by and large are talking about quotas and I i don't believe believe in quotas. 
>> He was visibly angry critics are ignoring subcabinet appointees who are female into they would count against the administration, the bean counters. If I had appointed white men to that position and you know that's true. 
>> Well, a question that we have to ask here is -- if we want to solve this problem and I think we all do, are we talking about combatting what's called "sexism?" For example, is the reason the white house press core has a certain problem with balance of types of people because they're there's people that think that women aren't as capable and therefore, the women don't get the jobs? If that's part of it, how much. And how much of sit a matter of combatting aspects of society which may be remnants of sexism along time ago or a longish time ago and are now just settled in such as the way companies have policies for childcare et cetera. Those are tough questions to answer. I don't know if we can be scientific about it. 
>> And it's a pipeline issue, too. If you think about where treasury secretaries come from you have to go back further than the president's week. They come from wall street and the federal reserve system. How many women and minorities are in that pipeline. The defense, and a lot of people had invested in michelle frio. Somebody that enlisted in vietnam and you go back to chuck hagel and from that standpoint he provides that diversity. Can women be in the military where they would be in a position to take that job so we6 to address issues of pipeline. It doesn't start at the presidential appointment. 
>> But the question is oh why are women not in the pipeline? What can be done about it in the present tense to fix it? Those questions are just always difficult to answer and sometimes, difficult to talk about is what I found interesting. 

[00:18:49]


>> I also think there's this kind of social network question and I think in some ways that gets to be -- the real issue is here. There's two questions about a, how should we measure this. All of the appointments, all the cabinet level appointments, who's in the inner circle because once you get to that it is a very male inner circumstance. 
>> Except for valerie jarrett. Is it a largely male inner circle? 
>> He's a man's man. 
>> And so the question becomes, who -- having lived in washington and watch this operate and my wife worked in the white house, so much of washington operates along the kind of spidering out of these social networks. Who knows who. And that's how jobs and appointments happen. No one's -- there's not some batch applications coming in and somebody's reading through an application. It's, I worked with this person the last time we were in clinton and there's a lot of this momentum in certain directions of who is going to be there. And I thought it was interesting that charlie rangel on our air here made this critique.

>>> It's embargs as hell. I think it's no excuse if it's the second term. If it's the first term you can say they had to know who was around them to get this job and I had thought and maybe so, it could be the harvard problem where people just know each other and trust each other and women and minorities don't get a chance to rub elbows and their representations and experiences is not known. He's had four years to work the bench to work the second team. So that in the second term, these people should be just as experienced as anybody -- any other american. 
>> You know it's interesting, speaking of the harvard problem. You had larry summers who was the president of harvard who famously and ultimately was forced out because his comments about women can't do math and science. He was treasury secretary and then timothy geithner and the tradition is continuing. That's what equal opportunity is about. You have to go beyond the people you know and it has to be all over the country. That's what job searches are about. Reaching out to people. Not just your comfort zone and that will make a better country and it's not just for reasons. It's very practil when you look at the economy, for example. It would have been extremely practical to get someone who's not actually involved in the economic crisis. 
>> But you have to realize, with charlie rangel's critique the caveat is there's this long-standing kind of, not bitterness but separation between the cdc and the caucus members and barack obama. He kind of stepped outside of the black pipeline. He didn't play ball with them. 
>> And the sort of other version, I wouldn't call it the "harvard problem" but the basic social networks. The entire rise of barack obama was in some ways building a parallel set of networks to the one that had existed in african-american politics particularly in primary states that had engendered a lot of frustration and anger. 
>> So whenever they get an opportunity to voice that frustration they do. 

[00:25:04]


>> But I thought the line about the harvard problem was an interesting and important one. You do see this -- and, you know, I'm in this, right? I've seen this firsthand because I've been embedded in that world. People that went to expensive fancy schools together know each other. People that work together at the same law firm, the ones that pay six figures, know each other and those networks of power are the networks in this administration and the administration before that and the administration before that, tended to channel people in and I don't know where the alternatives are. One alternative is the united states military which actually works as a fairly good engine of social mobility in terms of geing people through the ranks that come from all different walks of life but there isn't any kind of civilian version, i think, right now that in american life that's producing this kind of inclusive, you know, engine of social mobility. To get people into those sorts of things. 
>> Something worries me about calling it a network of power. Even though it is, I think we're dealing also, with something that's human which are birds of a feather. Not necessarily that you're thinking, we, who are white and in power, must keep it among ourself, the way, for example, white aristocrats did tend to think 50 years ago. It's who I know and who I hang out with. I don't think that's ever going to change so the answer seems to be that until we have the diversity we're looking for we have to counteract that natural human tendency and look beyond. 
>> That's why I think and we go back to the clinton quote about how should this be rectified. Everybody hates quotas. Quotas are bad. I'mo quotas. In the same way the format of a haiku poem or any kind of formal constraint producing innovation and creativity. The formal constraint of something like a quota or going through and auditing and doing the numbers is going to force you to be more energetic and inventive and innovative and any outside of your comfort zone when thinking about staffing. 

[00:27:06]


>> It's like the rooney rule. 
>> Great idea. 
>> Explain the rooney rule. 
>> You didn't have african-americans rising to the level of coaching in the back end particularly in professional football and baseball and professional sports leagues there were no african-americans in the back office. 
>> And it was -- incredibly embarrassing optically where you have tons of african-american athletes coached exclusive ily by white men. 
>> So the idea was whenever a coaching position came up you had to consider a certain number of minorities, african-americans, before they made a selection process and it forced the league to become more diverse so I think sometimes you do need to do the bean counting. 
>> I think quotas complicate things. I ran a program in nepal to get women in political parties. 
>> Many countries around the world that have enshrined quotas. 
>> And the quotas if you look at us compared to many other countries it can make a difference. They're a means to an end, not an end, and they can be complicated. The people ran their sister or mother and people re not train trained and it disproved the pot that women could be competent. Round two was different but there's this questn of, you know, what are we getting at. I think it's a way to get us in but in the end, the outcome is really different. I think back to the harvard question, there's an aspect of it that's the network and an aspect that harvard is very expensive. What it takes to get into this pipeline adds a whole other layer, I think part of this comes down to class. And who's being represented in different kmk capacities. It'sier to see the women and the gender or race in a photos. When it comes to diversity of opinion and how that's impacting policy which is where we should be taking the conversation. There's a lot of other layers to this in the harvard problem. 
>> And you can have one can mamg, say, a national security team that was multiracial and uniformly neoconservative in its orientation. And I think there's a question about how do we tabulates that at the end of the day? 

[00:29:12]


>> That's sort of a black seat on the supreme court. That doesn't mean african-americans are happy with the people sitting in it. They loved thurgood marshall and now we have clarence thomas. 
>> I think it's how we allocate the diversity of opinion. It should mean diversity of individual's opinions rather than supposing that people who are in a certain category will have certain ideas because often those ideas might be the ones that we, depending on what we're like but the other side of the coin is when we might not like them so we look for an individual kind of diversity and that would include the class kind as well but that's hard to do in the present tension. 
>> And also, I think, the final component is life experience really does matter. Having covered washington and it's like, one of the things we try to do at this table is bring people who have a lot of different life experiences, served in the many reens or were homeless or are unemployed or or socialologists and it produces people from various diverse grounds.

>>> This week, president obama nominated his chief counterterrorism advice or, john brennan to be the next director of the cia. At first glass he has the perfect resume. 25 year veteran, speaks fluid arabic and served as deputy executive director from 2001 to 2003 and director of the terrorist threat integration center from 2003 to 2004 and director of the interim national counterterrorism center from 2004 to 2005. And he seemed to have the perfect resume in 2008 when his name was floated to head the agency but back then the central role he held at the cia post 9/11 and his full-throated on the record defense of the bush era policies of rendition and enhanced interrogation techniques short of water boarding which he says is torture, caused again win outrage. Here's brennan in a 2007 interview. 
>> The cia has acknowledged it has detained about 100 terrorists since 9/11 and about a third have been subjected to what the cia refers to as enhanced interrogation tactics and only a small portion of those have been subjected to the most serious types of enhanced procedure. There have been a lot of information that's come out from the interrogation procedures that the agency has, in fact, used against the real hard did she core terrorists. It's saved lives. They are hardened terrorists who were responsible for 9/11. Shown no remorse for the death of 3,000 innocents. 
>> The backlash was so strong he withdrew his name and said it was immaterial to the critics that I'm a strong opponent to many of the politics of the bush administration such as coerrive interrogation tactics. Instead he was appointed to be the president's chief counterterrorism advice or and he's been described as the architect of obama's war on killing, through drone strikes. Four years later the concern about having brennan head the cir are muted and we hope the confirmation process will bring the necessary accounting of his role in not only president bush's role on terror.

[00:35:51]


>> Thanks for having me. 
>> Eli, from the -- I guess from the perspective of the universe of security folks and let me say this before I started the conversation. I wanted cia people at the table and we couldn't get it done and in order to speak about this stuff they have to get with the agency and they -- said there was a backlog. We are trying to get cia people because I think the institutional bureaucratic perspective on this is really important and let me express my frustration with the fact that we can't have them here, a. And b., All these conversations happen shrouded behind secrecy. All this secret information we don't have access to and that's massively frustrating from the perspective of a democratic citizen. So that said, eli, where do you think folks around the sort of security apparatus, the kind of frontline officers and the civil servants and the cia, where do you think they are on the question of both brennan and the legacy of the bush years and the torture regime, in terms of how they think about it? 
>> It's hard for me to give you a kind of universal this is what everybody in the cia thinks. I think there's clear a sense that when there was a question or potential for legal action in some capacity against cia officers even if personally know there's plenty of cia officers who disagreed with these enhanced interrogation techniques but they thought they were basically being asked to do something to be their country and potentially would have -- many of them have had to take out insurance plans they thought they would be sued in some capacity. That was something that I think was a bullet that was somewhat dodged but that's leon panetta who takes over as the director of the agency and becomes its biggest advocate and eventually the justice department's rereview of those cases and that issue has largely subsided. 
>> Meaning the justice department says, we're not going to prose anyone? 
>> What I gather is that they looked into it and decide not to go forward or re-open any of these particular cases. But that, I know, was a huge issue and that gets to the whole functionality of the agency. If you have officers who think that when they're told to do something -- I mean, the cia, keep in mind, it breaks the law internationally espionage is against the law. And tell them they could face queenss later on how can you have a functioning. 

[00:38:20]


>> There's a different between break a law in another country and breaking the law in the u.S. 
>> I agree but the cia has a legacy of breaking lots of laws in order to do what's called "directed action" which is a euphamism. 
>> And how germane do you think john brennan's record is? 
>> I think very germane. During the bush administration, there were about a dozen officials that were september up by the bush administration to the senate for basically, promotions. For better jobs. And looking for senate confirmations of them. The senate, with the exception of alberto gonzalez, rejected all of them or they withdrew on their own. And they had records and in some cases, I think they were probably less extensive than what john brennan has. They should take the same approach they took with the bush nominees. He was a central player at the cia. Deputy executive director for a while and chief of staff to porter goss, a. He knew everything about the torture and the secret prisons that porter goss knew. 
>> And I'll hold that. We'll talk about the last four years at kourntd terrorism advice or after we take this break. ?????? ?????? ?????? I don't wanna be right ??????

>>> Chris anderson, you said the senate should view this skeptically or do it like they did in the senate, embedded in at high levels in the cia during the torture regi, that's a kind of black mark on their record and I want to give the argument in opposition to that for a moment. Which is, a., What eli is saying. It was -- they were told it was cleared by aolc. They said it was legal. It came the down from the white house. They are, you know, in the authority structure. They are a product of the executive branch telling them what they were doing was legal and also, I think in brennan's defense the fact that he came out and called waterboarding which is the most extreme of the methods that were put on the table, he called it torture, unambiguously in 2007. Take a look. 
>> So was secretary rice correct today when they called it, a vital tool -- 
>> he said it's certainly subjecting a individual's severe pain and suffering which is the classic definition of torture and I think it's inconsistent techbt with american values and something that should be prohibited. Does that -- is that exculpatory in your view? 
>> He's not some cia agent at the line level. He was not out in the field. He was the deputy executive director. All the key points, he was chief of staff to porter goss during a lot of these key points. He wasn't a flew on the wall or someone at the bottom of the chain and one of the things i think is interesting to look at is -- when he withdrew his candidacy for this position four years ago, he wrote to then senator, I guess president elect at that point, obama, withdrawing his name and at the time he said that he had no role in the decisionmaking process for torture. But what we do know is that he knew everything about it. So one of the things that i think the senate's going to have to figure out is, is he kind after a fly on the wall? Cced on every memo or at one side of the spectrum. The other side of the spectrum is being, I guess, the decider. He's saying he wasn't the decider but there's a lot of space in between. And in d.C., Chief of staff or deputy director, what they are usually implementers. Not deciders or flies on the wall. They're implementers. And for someone at this level, if he was implementing this torture program, secret prison program, that's a big deal. 

[00:45:29]


>> I think that this discussion is complicated by the fact that everyone is implicated in this, right? Congress is implicated. They have successively -- successive congresss had a hands-off approach to these ideas of torture. We don't know how much at the senior level congress even knew about what was going on. The things that the bush administration did that were every american. 
>> Not just to every american. 
>> That's not true. 
>> Well -- to, well, that's important. They were done by the mush administration and they were all given a free pass. And somebody like this, I think, is not the implementer is not the person you need to look at. You need to look at the bush administration, all of whom got off scott free. 
>> And beyond the bush administration, the continuum of the bush administration to the obama administration. John brennan doesn't just come out of the bush administration he's been there for four years of president obama. And they're involved with the drone program. I just came from qatar where i was discussing climate and i went to al jazeera are and interviewed the only journalist held at guantanamo for years. He was never charged and released after six years. Held in afghanistan and guantanamo. He was tortured and constantly interrogated about who were the bosses at al jazeera are. An astounding story of how this man was held and after freed after a 400 day hunger fast. The reason I raise this is when people watch the senate confirmation hearings of john brennan, he's an example of one of the few voices of the voiceless that can describe the reality of what's happening on the ground add guantanamo. This is not just about jeanne brennan. It goes to president obama as well who promised to close it and it's now the fourth anniversary of president obama promising to close it. 
>> And congress blocked it. Congress is implicated in that. That was one of the first executive orders the president signed and the democrats wouldn't vote for it. 
>> You're right. Everyone is implicated here but john brennan, the inner circle of president obama and that goes to the issue of the drone wars as well. 

[00:47:33]


>> Let me push back for a second and just defend congress and the senate for a moment. Back during the bush administration, there were people who were put up for these positions. And one of john brennan's colleagues, john rizzo, who is at the time, acting general council of the cia, that's a senate-confirmed position, he had such a rough hearing and such a rough confirmation process that he was forced to withdraw his name from consideration for that position. There were other people, too. The candidate to be deputy attorney general of the justice department, tim flanagan, also withdrew his nomination. A number of other people including some top military leaders whose careers ended because of this. Not the same as going to prison or not the same as being charged with a crime for a role in torture but it's a big deal in d.C. And the senate -- 
>> you can say that john brennan had to spend four years in the pelty box, right? That he didn't -- 
>> that's hardly a penalty box there that position. 
>> The penalty box being the white house. 
>> And the leader in the intelligence community and i think so that the rest of the panel is engaged in a bit of moral posturing here because i think the policy of supporting allied counterterrorism and security services which I think do far more shocking of the conscious interrogations than everything we know about the eit program for the cia and that went on -- 
>> when you say "eit" you're talking about enhanced interrogation technique. 
>> John brennan acknowledged that waterboarding was torture. 
>> I think waterboarding does shock the conscious and america shouldn't do it and there's a debate 5b9 what constitutes torture and to assert that without accounting a disagreement on it -- 
>> you can call it torture and I'm not defending it but I'm saying that there's something deeper going on the the u.S. Liaison relationship before and after bush with the pakistani services, the egyptian services under mubarak and other countries is probably from a moral perspective, worse than anything that was done in the senior programs with the cia. 

[00:49:46]


>> And what you're talking about is the practice of rendition. 
>> Not just that, it's more than rendition. Rendition is when you can sure someone in country a. And bring them to country b. It is the joint operations that exist in total secrecy with these other services, where they pick something up and use u.S. Intelligence or use u.S. Or something like that and the u.S.

[00:53:24]


>> I was going to say one of the reasons mooef people think john brennan is the guy that barack obama wants is because there's a sense of a lot of what's being done in terms of the targeting killings with drones about forced protection. Not wanting to put boots on ground to wage the war on terror. And the idea that these operations shouldn't exist in the cia should be done in the pentagon and one of the things the president would need in order to move some of these operation into the pentagon is a willing cia director who wouldn't fight it so if john brennan was willing to allow a lot of these operations to move into the defense spheres out of the secretive world of the cia that would be a good outcome. 
>> We have to ask not just should it be done in the cio arrest the pentagon or should it be done at all and I think of four years ago when brennan was going to first be nominated but was forced to withdraw his -- any consideration. And I think of madea benjamin standing up, the protester at code pink, who stood up while he was speaking and she said i speak here to remember the 16-year-old in pakistan killed in a drone attack when he was simply investigating what was happening. He had held a news conference the day before to say what's happening in my country and she said, I speak for 16-year-old alachi, the son of the cleric in yemen. 16 years old born in denver. How was it two weeks after his father was killed he was kill in a drone strike. This goes to john brennan who was I want natalie involved with this and ultimately to president obama. This whole program of drones, of targeted killings, must be questioned. What madea benjamin said when she stood up is I speak for the constitution and my love of law and order. These are the kinds of debates we should be having. 
>> And there's no question from all of the warning that john brennan is intimately involved with the target-killing program. Every insider account -- 

[00:55:25]


>> he chooses the targets. 
>> In fact, there's a sort of like recurring thin about him as this priest-like presence. This is a "washington post" profile of brennan. Some white house aides describe him as a priest-like presence in thinks midst with a moral depth leveled by a dry witt and john rizzo recalled his surfacing in unexpected ways. Brennan once questioned rizzo's use of the bcc function in the agency's e-mail system to send a blind copy of a message to a third party without the primary recipients knowledge. He wasn't joking and he regarded that as underhanded. One of the ways I think the defense of the targets killing program has been carried out by the obama administration is to say, look, we understand we're playing with some dangerous stuff here. We have people, a tremendous moral rectitude and we have an intense internal process and it's sophisticated and rigorous and a legal memo from the olc saying we have the constitutional authority to do this. Of course, we don't know anything about what that legal memo looks like or what the actual -- how the list gets drawn up so the maddening then about all this is, yes, we should have the debate about targeting killings and john brennan's role and. 
>> Obama's kill list. 
>> A debate about all that and yet all of that has been in every turn blocked by the administration and courts from getting out into the public sphere so we're having a debate without the information. Eli respond to that after we take a break. ] bob, a regular guy with an irregular heartbeat. The usual, bob? Not today. 
[ Male Announcer ] BOB HAS AFIB: Atrial fibrillation not caused by a heart valve problem, a condition that puts him at greater risk for a stroke. 
[ Gps ] turn left. I don't think so. 
[ Male Announcer ] FOR YEARS, BOB TOOK WARFARIN, And made a monthly trip to the clinic to get his blood tested. But not anymore. Bob's doctor recommended a different option: Once-a-day xarelto????. Xarelto???? is the first and only once-a-day prescription blood thinner for patients with afib not caused by a heart valve problem, that doesn't require routine blood monitoring. Like warfarin, xarelto???? is proven effective to reduce the risk of an afib-related stroke. There is limited data on how these drugs compare when warfarin is well managed. No routine blood monitoring means bob can spend his extra time however he likes. New zealand! Xarelto???? is just one pill a day, taken with the evening meal. And with no dietary restrictions, bob can eat the healthy foods he likes. Do not stop taking xarelto???? rivaroxaban without talking to the doctor who prescribes it for you. Stopping may increase your risk of having a stroke. Get medical help right away if you develop any signs or symptoms of bleeding, like unusual bruising or tingling. You may have a higher risk of bleeding if you take xarelto???? with aspirin products, nsaids or blood thinners. Talk to your doctor before taking xarelto???? if you currently have abnormal bleeding. Xarelto???? can cause bleeding, which can be serious, and rarely may lead to death. You are likely to bruise more easily on xarelto????, and it may take longer for bleeding to stop. Tell your doctors you are taking xarelto???? before any planned medical or dental procedures. Before starting xarelto????, tell your doctor about any conditions, such as kidney, liver or bleeding problems. Ready to change your routine? Ask your doctor about once-a-day xarelto????.

>>> Hello from new york. I'm chris hayes and I have msnbc contribute tore joy reed and eli lake chris anders of the aclu amy goodwin. We are talking about john brennan. He's been instrumental in devicing the strategy for wage what can is no longer called officially the war on terror but is something. You know, activities in a whole bunch of countries and a lot of targets killing. And one of the questions I think on the table is -- what role he has played in that. And also this kind of accountability question. I wanted to bring into the conversation, we wer talking about the kill list. I also wondered when we talked about accountability, to bring in the story offen. 
>> -- I think it's important, these two things are happening in the same week. Which he's the cia agent on the 25th and he agreed to serve 35 months. He e-mailed the name of a covert cia officer to a reporter and in the midst of a. 
>> Reporter:ING OUT WHAT WAS Going on with the torture regime in the cia. He's the first current or former cia officer of disclosing classified information to a reporter and he is, as of now, the only person that's going to do jail time for their involvement in the torture regime. No one else is going to see the inside of a jail cell except this guy, who talked to a reporter about what was going on. And then in the same week, someone who is relatively high upe chain of command at the cia during the period of time is nominated to head the agency. I think it's one thing to say, to me it's one thing to say as i think you were making the argument before, eli, look, these people put themselves on the line. And they were given legal assurances and the cia has to do their job and if you want to go after anyone you should go after people that -- you said, all these other people are implicated but then to match that with the fact that this dude is going to jail for 30 months because me talked about the program to a reporter so we can know about it? 

[01:02:23]


>> He disclosed the departmentity of somebody undercover. 
>> Eli lake, y. 
>> Reporter: -- 
>> I will never defend that. 
>> I agree with you. I don't like it when there's high-level prosecutions. 
>> You're a great security reporter. I know things because people talk to you. 
>> Yes, I agree. But I was making the distinction THERE THAT FROM THE CIA's Perspective because I sometimes feel like I have to play that role. 
>> That's fine. 
>> And I want to make it very clear no more leak laws. No more leak investigations and leak to me. Bubba I would say that from the CIA's PERMANENT THEY BELIEVE That there's a huge distinction between giving up the identity of somebody undercover which is why that law was basically passed after there were, I guess it was the phillip amgy book that identified the cia station in greece. It turned out it looks like the killers knew that before the ag disclosures but nonetheless, there's a huge difference between identifying someone undercover and whose accident e identity is secret and waterboarding someone. 
>> But that's from the cia perspective. That shouldn't necessarily be the justice department perspective. 
>> But remember, under president obama, more whistle blowers have been prosecuted than under all other presidents combined. 
>> But those have been under, we should be clear this that's the espionage act which is different. This is not the espionage act. 
>> Right. 
>> And we have to remember, too, the vice president of the united states is deputy scooter libby and carl row were prosecuted for outing a cia undercover. 
>> And neither was dick armitage. 
>> Here's the point. If we say we want an accountability moment the accountability should have been with the people that crafted the policy in the moush administration and wrote the memo who note the subsequently revoked olc memo that talked about organ failure that is morally ode use in every way. 

[01:04:28]


>> It's the president of the united states, president obama, who made the choice that they wouldn't face accountability. Here's the president on january 11, 2009, making this argument about moving forward that's become the kind of hallmark with a look. 
>> I don't believe anybody is above the law. On the other hand, I also have a belief that we need to look forward as looking backwards. And part of my job is to make sure that, for example, the cia, you've got extraordinarily talented people who are working very hard to keep americans safe. I don't want them to suddenly feel like they've got to spend all their time looking over their shoulders and lawyering. 
>> I think that's what people should be doing. They should be very concerned about wleernt they would go to jail. Last night at riverside church in new york, hundreds gathered to celebrate the 85th birthday of ramsey clark, the former u.S. Attorney general. Among -- one of the last times i saw ramsey clark was in syracuse. He was testifying at a trial of scores of people, peace activists who had laid down their bodies in front of the has beenford air base, protesting the fact that their drones are directed. Their drones, people go in and for people to understand how drones work. You don't have to be in the field. They're on a computer and you're just killing people from the comfort of your -- a mile from your house. And these people got convicted and ramsey clark, if former u.S. Attorney general, was speaking out on their behalf. We have to give voice to, not only the victims, because this doesn't increase our national security. The fact that most people in pakistan see the u.S. As the enemy, it not what most people in the united states understand. They're not supposed to be an enemy. Because of the number of drone attacks and a half been going on there, I hope that this john brennan nomination will open up a full discussion about torture and drone wars and what the u.S. Is doing. That's what would be productive. 

[01:06:31]


>> What is that not going to happen, eli? 
>> The policy of untiling terrorists widely popular and not just popular from a kind of -- 
>> it's not terrorists we're talking about the vast majority of the people who were killed are innocent civilians. 
>> Whatever you want to say about the drone program, and i would agree that in all of these calls for more transparency and less secrecy I'm with the left on this. But I would make it very, very clear that what is the alternative? Terms of -- 
>> to killing innocent people? 
>> It's not about killing innocent people. A lot of these drone attacks have been successful and the fact of the matter is we don't know because it is -- 
>> it is shrouded in secrecy. I any a more responsible view. 
>> Eli, stanford and n yochlt u did a study called "living under drones." Thousands of innocent people have been killed in the drone attacks. When you say we got guilty people and were they tried? 
>> No. 
>> There were thousands of people who are innocent? 
>> You have to look at the fact that the fact that elias cashmerery no longer breathes or bin laden no longer breathes, those are very popular policies. I think it's a reasonable position to say, I want all the data and what the cia knows about its civilian casualties. How they make these decision and I'm for that. The notion that the entire 3r578 the shroud -- 
>> and shock and awe dropping cluster bombing all over reek killinged a lot of civilians but we had a president that the said we could wage unlimited war on terrorists, decide who thr and kill them with. Whether it's with bunker buster bombs or drones. When the congress of the united states the power to wage war it's rare that an executive gives back power. That's why we have a balance of power in the legislative branch. 

[01:08:33]


>> I think an important point. Al earn the of the drone program is if hunt for the ambassador in libya which rely on security services that won't help people. 
>> It's part of -- let me intervene for a moment. I think that's partly a false choice. To be clear you're talking about the authorization for the use of military force which is passed essentially unanimously by congress which gives incredibly broad powertion and was used by if mush administration and subsequently by the obama administration as the statutory legal basis for much of what they do and their conduct though I'll say and we come back to this, if actual reasoning for why they're able, froins, to -- the white house, to target someone like amar alachi and the olc contends that they have a process that meets the constitutional threshold of due process but we don't know what it looks like because that memo is locked behind secrecy and they won't give it up and a district court judge just ruled they don't have to give it up so I think there's a few -- I want to compartmentalize a few issues because they all run together. The number of civilian casualties of the drone program is a massive ily strooirch consideration and moral consideration. Is the ratio of terrorists killed to civilians 1-10, 10-1? That matters in the calculation. Second of all, what do we know about the drone program before we make those moral or strategic valuations. And should we be doing it at all? Even if we're doing it in a really efficient way, are there alternatives to targeted killing in other countries? But none of those things can be debated with sophistication ory gore in the absence of the most basic kinds of information that we do not have access to. 
>> And I think for eli's point about how popular these programs are, the reason that the targeted killing program does poll well is because selective leaks. The only thing people know about the program are what's being put out there as its successes. And the reality of the program and the scope of the program and the failures of the program and legal opinions are all being hidden from the public and they're even being hidden from senators. 

[01:10:51]


>> And I'll say this to the final points. Again, in these calculations, if people saw the facebook page of abdul alachi with a facebook page from denver, that the american people killed, right? That would change, I think, people's way of thinking about the program. Now, again, you're going to say, obviously, we were not targeting him and it was an accidents and there's collateral damage. 
>> I'm willing to suspend all that. I agree. We don't know and we need more information. 
>> But the brennan confirmation hearing could be an opportunity if members of the committee are watching this, could be an opportunity to ask some hard questions about that. Eli lake of news week and chris anders of aclu and amy goodwin of democracy now, thank you.

>>> We've been talking about the lack of accountability for intelligent personals to engaged in or approved of torture and we've seen a similar lack of accountability from wall street to congress to the catholic church. But after more than a decade of massive institutional failures, political dysfunction and incompetence, systemic financial fraud and wars waged on false premises which have gone without official sanction there's one area of american life where wrongdoing has been strongly and unkwoifally condemned. Professional sports. This week for the first time in 17 years, the baseball writers association of america chose to elect no one to the baseball hall of fame because so many of the leading candidates, roger clemens and barry bonds, in particular, have been accused of using performance-enhancing drugs and deserving candidates who never tested positive for steroid use have been shut out from the hall on the mere suspicion they may have cheated. After the hall of fame debachle they announced a more restrictive drug testing program in an effort to put the steroid era as far in the rearview era as possible. Bud selig said the new agreement, quote, addresses critical drug issues and symbolizes major league, baseball's vigilance against performance enhancing substances and that the league would continue to do everything it can to main than I a leadership stature in the years ahead. Moon while, "usa today" reported yesterday that lance armstrong plans to, quote, make an admission about doping in an interview with oprah winfrey that he'll tape tomorrow. Armstrong was stripped of his SEVEN tour de France titles and banned from professional cycling after an investigation of the u.S. Doping agency found he used and distributed performance-enhancing drugs. So far he's strenuously denied that he ever engaged in doping. Me now is dave z year. Re know. Author of "game over."

[01:17:20]


>> Thanks. 
>> I tnk this is such a fascinating kind of microcosm and a look at america. Hbc is laundering billions of dollars of drugs for drug kingpins worldwide and they get a settlement and it's on page a-16. A bunch of people approving waterboarding who were shot through the intelligence agencies, right? And like everyone is just freaking out about the baseball players and the example of this is this is documentary filmmaker ken burns. This is him on steroid use by baseball players. Take a look. I have no guarantee that anyone you loved and think is way bof -- sorry. I have no guarantees anyone you love and think is way aboch that "didn't do it." That's why they need to wait and wait and wait because it makes it impossible for us to judge excellence in this era. Those blooiv fors should suffer for a while. Those mother efers should suffer for a while. What did you think by the decision of the writers not to elect anyone? 
>> The same writer who is in 1990's TURNED A BLIND EYE WHILE These records were being set, i thought it was a colossal sham and hypocritical for about a thousand different reasons that we could go after, not the least of where I that the baseball hall of fame is rife with players who are guilty of other kinds of transgressions, to put it mildly. So to put this kind of stamp on THE 1990's TO PRETEND THE 1990's Didn't happen effectively, was something that I thought was a fraudulent act by the baseball writer's association of america. 57d in effect, they're absolving the game itself. Not a lack of enforcement. It was becoming obvious not just to the writers but to the teams themselves, that, you know, BARRY BONDS AND mark McGwire and sammy sosa did not just do this in the weight room. They were the first ones to discover a gym or something like that. A way of absolving them. But I think that, although i like the condemnation of cheating and I applaud it with you that this organ of fairness still functions among one class of people, sports fans, the problem is the way the ballots are set up as long as the baseball writers continue to dit they remain on the ballot because they won't get less than 5% and won't get 75% and then they block other worthy people from being considered for their achievements naturally. 

[01:20:03]


>> You say lock of enforcement? I say enforcement. Baseball games were 2-0, 1-0. And now they're 14-9. You can't tell me that major league baseball didn't like the fact that you have these scores. 
>> You have basketball and football and high-scoring points and they love the fact that there were a lot of more runs. 
>> And the home run race in 1998 between McGwire and sosa was absolutely, no question, great for baseball and we saw attendance go up. Revenue went up. It was like the housing bubble. It was the version of the bubble. 
>> I had a player say to me when it comes to steroids in major league baseball and performance-enhancing drugs drib schun is a team issue but punishment is an individual issue. The idea that the entire weight of the era goes on barry bonds, he's like the 21st century sports world, this pursued, prosecuted creature and the institution is let off scott-free. 
>> But I'm not sure why it's wrong. Despite all the things done many the past and all the blind eyes that were turned that at this point there's some sort of discipline and some sort of accountability being leveled. Genuine question. Now we're disavows what happened before and it's not going to happen again. Isn't that a good thing? 
>> Answer that question after this break. ] tests, prego. Prego?! But I've bought ragu for years.

>>> We just discovered that john wrote a review of one of dave's books. 
>> Opposite of love is indifference. I appreciate the passion. 
>> I learned so much. 
>> You asked a question which i think is really good. To say, what is wrong with basically, attempting to starting to assert some accountability and expression of -- this was wrong in saying, look, there's this -- no one's going to get in the hall and this is how we're going to start to put a stake in the ground. 
>> I thought this was about progress. 
>> But a small part of me feels like enforcing this accountability, acts as this weapon of mass distraction. Saying in american society we'll be moral on the question of barry bonds and lance arm strong. As for the whole lying to go to war in iraq thing or the financial markets, that we're not going to talk about that too much so there's a social fupgs. 
>> That's the baseball writer problem. 
>> I think that's true. It's not the writers who are saying that as well but I think it's serves that social function but the bigger issue iu the issue of hypocrisy when they're trying to assert this on the '90s WHEN SO MUCH OF THE HISTORY Of baseball is rife with not only people using performance enhancing drug but a whole era before 1947 where you had the ultimate performance of hitters like pitchers not having to pitch against josh gibson. The institution itself. 
>> Doesn't it make it's easy to do it when so many people dislike barry bonds. It's not like the baseball writers love barry bonds. He's the perfect villain to take this out on. 
>> I think you're tading on dangerously moralistically dangerous ground. I agree, the self-righteousness of them that they should suffer is a little over the top but, like, the sport went through, i think, a really did sting lt period there. You can say there were different infractions in the past and people used greenies and amphetamines and we know all that but the comprehensiveness with which institutionally from the top all the way down, this shot through the sport and destroyed the norms and rules within it was distinct and something worthy of accounting. 

[01:26:32]


>> But isn't it opposite of moral relativism to say it's immoral to put the weight on the ERA ON mark McGwire, barry bonds and sammy sosa? The owners aren't returning the money, the $2.5 billion television deals and the hundreds of millions of dollars for funding for stadiums that really did grow out of the steroid era. 
>> The sport itself does suffer from the bad reputation it acquired. So there is a price that's paid in the case of the hall of famers that are not going to be hall of famers because of the writer's objections to their steroid using with they'll lose income too. You pay more to have a hauling of fame comment appear at you're memorabilia event or signed card. 
>> One of the things that's so interesting is it related back to the cia problem. In from the top to the bottom. If fronts line people, cia interrogators or the baseball players taking the juice. And they were supported and facilitated and covered up for by a whole set of structural issues that allowed that continue and then the question is, where is the wreck onning? One of the dangers is wrens fr when you zero in on an individual it looks like hypocrisy but the other solution looks like the solution with the torture era, we can't go after anyone individually so we'll go after them individually and i think the baseball players in not doing that are -- it's better. I'm with john on that sort of. 
>> There's a problem in the sense of, it's not like the cia where there's memos about everything and you can discover wap with baseball players this is endone informally and passing things from locker to locker and we don't have good tests from 1989 to 2004 to judge by. So we little rally don't he. We can't know. So if mike piatsa breaks through. 

[01:28:45]


>> He had over 50% of the vote, whereas the other big names didn't. 
>> For those who are not sports guys, he's one of the best power hitting catchers in the history of baseball, hitting catchers many the history of baseball and he's one of the people who's in the grey area. Roger clemens and barry bonds were all sure about what they did but there's a lot of people that have come out and admitted it. Piazza has never said he did but there's this obsession with finding it out. Here's murray chaz, his white whale that he's hunting with the piazza. In baseball he's long been a steroids suspect. All his teammates and anyone else in us his teammates saw his acne covered back welcome a telltale sign of steroids until baseball started to test for steroids and then the acne magically disappeared. Interesting. And then the idea that they wrote about and one of the former teammates of lance armstrong wrote about is the idea of a truth and reconciliation committee is as a way to deal with this period in the sport.I'm barely wearing anything!

>>> Talking about doping scandals in major league baseball and cycling and the reaction and how to sort of deal with an institution that went through a period where there was a lot of moral rot. I want to be very clear in terms of comparing different 'institutions. Torture on the moral scale of wrong is way, way, way different than using performance-enhancing drugs. I would never equate the two jous so that's clear but in terms of how an institution deals with what went on within the institution and this is true with wall street and a whole bunch of other things as well and baseball did this thing where they didn't elect anyone to the hall of fame and now the big lance armstrong issue. Lance armstrong is fascinating too. The u.S. Doping agency issued this comprehensive incredible report and it's pretty -- it's only one side of the story. There's no defense brief to read but lance armstrong comes across like a tony soprano thing. Like he's running this criminal enterprise and bringing people into it and like, you start out and then you get lance armstrong tells you how to start doping and this is this very corrupting aspect to the whole thing and u.S. Anti-doping agency ceo travis tiger said, in regard to the truth and reconciliation process I firmly believe you have to reset the sport and have a cleansing period oord. If not the past continues to drip, drip, drip and will dig itself up, a mixed metaphor. People who doped in the past and it could be the recent past have never been held accountable and more likely they are to continue to dope so as long as they're still in the sport and many of them are at some levels as athletes, directors, team owner or maybe in the ranks of the cycling governing body, there's less likely to change. 

[01:34:42]


>> There's something to be said. We're talking about baseball players and it might seem somewhat theatrical talking about tony soprano compared to larger issues like drones and malfeasance on wall street but maybe this serves a purpose. Human beings can begin with the visceral. You wuk by a bar and see people watching sports on tv which is alien to me but I see how 30r7b9 these things are to most people, like me at home playing the piano. And lance armstrong, is one powerful personality maybe we can go from this to apply this to more abstract, less visceral issues. There's a lesson to be learned here, I hope. 
>> Sething I wanted to say is sports are this working-class past time and sometimes, we're talking about a back stages -- they say sports are a distraction and I think this is exact approximately right. Especially polite liberals and the wonk class could learn from sports fans that an intense desire for fairness can be cleansing. No one is looking at barry bonds and saying he's too big to prosecute in this british bank. Right? In a sense the dirtiest trick -- 
>> you're saying retributional impulse you're seeing from fans. 
>> I'm saying desire for fairness. When you look at the scandals like "too big to fail" it's the dirtiest trick the democrats played on polite liberals by saying that this corruption, this entrenched corruption, is i identified with the well being of everyone. And you actually have to protect it. You have to protect a giant bank from prosecution or from its own failures. 
>> The two big -- 
>> from everyone else. 
>> The too big to fail is major league baseball. I agree with john but I have a different view. To me there's something dangerous about the narrative that says you clean things up by going after the person at the low end of the chain of command. That's like saying abu ghraib is about lindy england and not the scale. And that's why I feel passionately about the way sports sends this message for the country. It's like a stalking horse about how we're going to look at these different issue eshs and when you have a situation like congress does what the former representative tom lance does, "the theater of the absurd" with the steroid trials and they don't call -- they call one general manager. Brian sabian of the giants and zero owners.

>> There's a quote from my book AT john McCain going after the player's union. So what do you think of the lance armstrong thing? Lance armstrong, you really are going after the cop. And then it took some -- it actually, did, take some risk on the part of the institutional cycling to go after this icon. This guy who was the most successful athlete in his sport in history, a. And b, this amazing story of beating cancer and coming back and winning and, c, was a cultural phenomenon. If you look at 2004 campaign footage. John kerry, has a live strong lance armstrong yellow bracelet on his arm. There was a time when everybody you ran into in this country had I live strong bracelet on so for them to go back after him -- 
>> not to cut you we're in a age where nothing is heroic. Tiger woods went down. Lance armstrong is not a hero. Baseball is a lie. And I mean, I think that for parents of kids who play sports, this whole spectacle has been even more depressing because, i just lived in florida which is a factory for little football players and no one talks about the injuries these kids are suffering. The extent to which they're destroying their growing bodies to play this sport because sports has this great iconography which has become a lie. 
>> Like they said in "batman" die a hero or live long enough to become a villain and with the case of lance armstrong it's very specific for two reasons. The first is, you read the report and no other athlete has ever been presented with, there's thank you want to bike with me? There's things you got to do if you bike with me. It's like, did mario puzzo write this. But the second part is like, my goodness. I have relatives that fought through cancer and that rubber bracelet is a bond which makes me feel like -- lance armstrong if they find out he did anything short of drowning puppies and it would be like, I'll stand up for lance armstrong. 

[01:39:16]


>> More on that after we take a break. With an irregular heartbeat. The usual, bob? Not today. 
[ Male Announcer ] BOB HAS AFIB: Atrial fibrillation not caused by a heart valve problem, a condition that puts him at greater risk for a stroke. 
[ Gps ] turn left. I don't think so. 
[ Male Announcer ] FOR YEARS, BOB TOOK WARFARIN, And made a monthly trip to the clinic to get his blood tested. But not anymore. Bob's doctor recommended a different option: Once-a-day xarelto????. Xarelto???? is the first and only once-a-day prescription blood thinner for patients with afib not caused by a heart valve problem, that doesn't require routine blood monitoring. Like warfarin, xarelto???? is proven effective to reduce the risk of an afib-related stroke. There is limited data on how these drugs compare when warfarin is well managed. No routine blood monitoring means bob can spend his extra time however he likes. New zealand! Xarelto???? is just one pill a day, taken with the evening meal. And with no dietary restrictions, bob can eat the healthy foods he likes. Do not stop taking xarelto???? rivaroxaban without talking to the doctor who prescribes it for you. Stopping may increase yo risk of having a stroke. Get medical help right away if you develop any signs or symptoms of bleeding, like unusual bruising or tingling. You may have a higher risk of bleeding if you take xarelto???? with aspirin products, nsaids or blood thinners. Talk to your doctor before taking xarelto???? if you currently have abnormal bleeding. Xarelto???? can cause bleeding, which can be serious, and rarely may lead to death. You are likely to bruise more easily on xarelto????, and it may take longer for bleeding to stop. Tell your doctors you are taking xarelto???? before any planned medical or dental procedures. Before starting xarelto????, tell your doctor about any conditions, such as kidney, liver or bleeding problems. Ready to change your routine? Ask your doctor about once-a-day xarelto????.

[ bop ] 
[ bop ] 
[ bop ] You can do that all you want, I don't like v8 juice. 
[ Male Announcer ] HOW ABOUT V8 V-FUSION. A full serving of vegetables, a full serving of fruit. But what you taste is the fruit. So even you... Could've had a v8. 
>>> Lance armstrong is going to appear on oprah on thursday's taping the interview tomorrow. And I think the point you made is really important. In terms of the importance of live strong and what that thent and what that meant to so many people and the thing I said on the break was that's whys kind of amazed and admire the anti-doping agency's report because if there's anyone that's too being a to fail it's lance armstrong. You can imagine people when that report was being created or when they were doing it making the same argument about they like made about the banks. If you hurt people you're cutting off the funds to his charity which does really important work. You know what I mean? And yet, they did it anyway because, I think to their credit, there's a genuinely desire for accountability and i think that's what michael says about how sports pulls out that part of us that hates cheating. 
>> But a part of us that, and I'm going to be alone on this -- to say said, musada, the anti-doping agency got millions of dollars of taxpayer money go after someone that's not been a competitive cyclist for five YEARS, HADN'T WON A TOUR de France in five or six years so i think it's worth stepping back and saying given where we are in a country is this where we want our resources and obsessions to rely? Federal agents look at cyclists like they're -- 
>> the crotchedy old testament part of me that sees no one get punished for anything for years says -- yes! 
>> Get lance armstrong. 
>> And I think you and I differ on this but I think there's somethin really important ant that and then there's the question of, what do you do about the sport now? Right? 
>> That's the thing, too. If you -- the reason why they haven't awarded any of the seven tour de Frances to the seconds-place winners is because seven winners have been implicated. 

[01:44:13]


>> This is more about our becoming sort of one community. The internet must have something to do with this in that we would reach this fever pitch and have this kinds of reform. That doesn't have any capitalist motive. It seems to be an uptick in what's considered in morality in this prosecuting the cheating. It's wonderful and it wouldn't have happened before and I'm hoping it starts with baseball, god love baseball, and then move o to other things. 
>> Baseball needs to get more specific. fred McGriff, great slugger, first baseman, no evidence that he ever took steroids, he went through his career hitting 30 HOMERS AND 100 RBIs AND SHOULD Be hall and has been caught up in this sweeping year punishment. 
>>> What to know for the news week ahead coming up. Nice'n easy with colorblend technology gives expert highlights and lowlights. For color that's true to you. I don't know how she does it.

>>> Nominations for this year's aadd my awards this week and the list included several films we talked about on the show. Congratulations in order to those involved and the remarkable ground biking "how to surv-- "how to survive a plague." 

[01:48:32]


>>> And best adapted screen play, one of "lincoln's" 12 nods. And "zero dark thirty", received five nominations including best film. And we'll update you on a story we discussed yesterday. The possibility that the treasury department could, under a little known statute, could make a platinum coin and deposit it to the federal reserve to step aside of a fight with the debt ceiling and and after the treasury department issued a statement saying that quote, neither the treasury department nor the federal reserve believes the law can or should be used to facilitate the production of platinum coins to avoid the increase in the debt limit. And finally a quick personal update, I'll be in baltimore on wednesday to talk about my book "twilight of the elites." A chapter about the steroids era in baseball and I'll be at pratt library. 
>>> And you should know aaron schwartz has died of suicide at age 26. His body was found in his apartment on friday. Aaron was one of those naturally brilliant precocious hackers who at the age of 14 codeveloped the syndication of rss web protocol and is a key component of the we be's infrastructure. He founded a company to merge with a user generated social site which is one of the most highly trafficked. Reviewed dozens of books. He wrote beautifully and prolifically. He worked with progressive change committee and founded demand progress to keep the internet open and free and the battle to stop and defeat online pirate si act. He created the ice ensing system so many on the internet use. Wer fellows for et. We would grab lunch, talk politics and ideas and he would talk about books he was planning on writing. He was a 20th century nerd renaissance man. He suffered from depression. He wrote of depression in a post titled "sick." Perhaps you have been sad. Your face falls, perhaps you cry. You wonder if it's worth going on. Everything you think about seems bleak. The things you have done, the things you hope to do. The people ound you. Depressed mood is like that. It doesn't come for any reason or go either. Go get fresh air, cuddle with a loved one. You don't feel better. Upset of feeling the joy everyone else seems to feel. Everything is colored by sadness. If you are depressed, you are not alone. There are millions of people suffering from depression and help is available. You should note the time of his death, he was being prosecuted by the federal government and $1 million in fines for the crime of, I am not exaggerating, downloading too many free articles. Aaron had used a computer script to massively download articles he had legitimate access to, almost million in all with the intent to make them free to call. He never did. Federal prosecutors dropped a staggering 13 count felony on him for his actions. In a statement about his death, aaron's family and partner wrote, his death is not a simple tragedy. It's the product of the criminal justice system. Decisions made by officiin a massachusetts u.S. Attorney's office at m.I.T. Contributed to his death. It's a reason to revisit the 1986 computer abuse act. The law is far too broad and a good time to take a hard look at massachusetts u.S. Attorney who prosecuted him with reckless disproportion vigor and coing a run for governor. We are goi miss you. We are going to miss your mind, righteous heart and sensitive soul. I want to find out what my guests think we should know for the week coming up. Joy. 

[01:53:08]


>> Conservatives are discovering that ronald reagan, the pay troll saint of! All things conservative committed an act they are outraged about. In 1967 when he was governor signing the mullford act to this wart the black panthers from armed patrols and banned the carrying of weapons or guns. M mullford was a man who represented uc berkeley. They tried to evict anti-war protesters. He believed they were communists and perverts. 
>> Fascinating entangled roots of gun control. 
>> There's irony. 
>> Every year there is a controversial super bowl ad. You know this year it will be for a company called soda stream. They carbonate beverages. It's an israeli company that exists. The factory exists in the occupy -- it's an illegal settlement in the west bank. This is already leading to a lot of protests that this commercial is going to be played in the super bowl since it's on an illegal settlement. There's a protest in washington, d.C. Against soda stream and counter protest by those supporting soda stream and having them on illegal settlements in the west bank. It will show up on the largest possible station in the united states, the super bowl. 
>> Something to look out for, john? 
>> It's interesting. Looking at the story of the obama administration and women got me thinking of women in the arts and the different statistics. We have tina fey and amy poehler hosting the awards. The upcoming premier of the girl ies on hbo. Last time, there were five women in the top ten and three women -- I think it's a good thing, too, even if we have discrepancies to make up for. 

[01:55:22]


>> I recommend everyone go to "the new york times" and find a series being done on gifted and talented programs in new york city schools. There's no one lesson to be drawn from this. It's a fascinating portrait of a system within a system whether you believe it's segregated by merit or on race. Read the reporting. What they have found is that every time a new task is introduced to resolve the problem of racial disparities they increase. 
>> I have a whole chapter in my book about the school I went to, a gifted and talented high school here in new york about this issue. That's been fantastic. I want to thank joy reed, dave from the nation, john from columbia university and michael from the american conservative magazine. Thank you all. Thank you for joining us. We'll be back next weekend at 8:00 eastern time. We'll be on the first road trip in washington, d.C. For the run up to president obama's second inauguration. We will talk to members of the congress and the civil rights activists. We'll deliver the invocation for president obama's inauguration. Next is melissa harris perry. She explores what is next for the gun debate. Is it a mark of victory for women in a field dominated by men? It's melissa harris perry. See you next week on "up." rosa chantix. When the doctor told me that I could smoke for the first week... I'm like...Yeah, ok... Little did I know that one week later I wasn't smoking. 
[ Male Announcer ] ALONG WITH SUPPORT, Chantix is proven to help people quit smoking. It reduces the urge to smoke. Some people had changes in behavior, thinking or mood, hostility, agitation, depressed mood and suicidal thoughts or actions while taking or after stopping chantix. If you notice any of these stop taking chantix and call your doctor right away. Tell your doctor about any history of depression or other mental health problems, which could get worse while taking chantix. Don't take chantix if you've had a serious allergic or skin reaction to it. If you develop these stop taking chantix and see your doctor right away as some can be life-threatening. If you have a history of heart or blood vessel problems, tell your doctor if you have new or worse symptoms. Get medical help right away if you have symptoms of a heart attack. Use caution when driving or operating machinery. Common side effects include nausea, trouble sleeping and unusual dreams. It helps to have people around you... They say, you're much bigger than this. And you are.

=======================================================

Gu. It has to be that america is the only country in the world that has video games. Only country in the world that has video games. 
>>> From cnn world headquarters in atlanta this is "early start" weekend. No end in sight. The latest on the national flu epidemic. 
>> You really believe this story? Osama bin laden. 
>> Yeah. 
>> Her confidence. 
>>> Washingn may be less popular than cockroaches, but, man, can they sell movies. How hollywood has turned government paper pushes into blockbuster action stars. 
>>> Do you have a cat? Well, he's probably trying to kill you. Author matthew inman explains the theory behind his very funny best-selling book. 
>>> IT IS SUNDAY, JANUARY 13th, Good morning, everyone. I'm randi kaye. 
>>> We start this morning with your health and the flu epidemic that has gripped the nation. The vast majy of the nation reporting widespread flu activity. More than 100 people have died this season. In new york state, governor andrew cuomo has declared a public health emergency because of the flu. He issued the order yesterday. Gives pharmacists the ability to vaccinate children as young as six months. The state's health commissioner describes the increases in cases new york has seen this year. 
>> AS OF JANUARY 5th, THE STATE Health department received reports of over 2,800 patients hospitalized with laboratory confirmed influenza compared to 1,169 for all of last year. 

[00:02:05]


>> Governor cuomo set out to be an example of why he thinks getting the flu shot is important by getting vaccinated right in front of reporters. 
>>> It's not too late for you to get a flu shot. The cdc says this year's flu shot is a good match for the flu strain making its way across the u.S. And up to 62% effective. Despite that advice, many don't want to get one. Lisa sylvester takes a look at why we don't want to get some. 
>> More. 
>> Reporter: It's a good defense against the flu. Hand sanitizer, but when it came to getting a flu shot for her 2-year-old daughter, dana was less certain. 
>> I really thought about it and between the odds of her having a bad reaction versus catching the flu, I felt like the flu and having heard down and out and possibly risking her health or her life wasn't worth it. 
>> Reporter: Dana ended up getting a flu shot for her daughter, but others we talk to say no thanks to the flu vaccine. 
>> Busy with work and just didn't seem to affect me, i don't think. 
>> I'm not sure I'm confident in its ability to really protect me. 
>> Reporter: There are concerns with the flu shot that lead some not to get one. Many of those reasons, though, are actually baseless. First notion is that the flu shot can actually give you the flu. Dr. Greg cope is an e.R. Doctor in washington. 
>> The virus has been broken down into many parts that are inactivated and wilot cause the flu. 
>> Reporter: Another common complaint that it isn't effective. While it is true that scientists who develop the vaccine think which strains will be prevalent. On the whole the flu vaccine is still worth getting. 
>> I think generally the effectiveness for all ages is approximately 60%. 
>> Reporter: One of the most common concerns is that the flu vaccine might be linked to autism. The issue has been looked at extensively by the medical community. A 2010 centers for disease control and prevention study concluded "the thimerosal containing immunizations did not increase the risk of any of the asd autism specktrism disorder outcomes." You can get a flu shot that is thimerosal free. 

[00:04:40]


>> The people who are not candidates, people who have true allergies to the vaccination and sometimes people who have severe egg allergies or the very young, below 6 months. Generally very safe. The healthy you are, the more efficient it will be. 
>> Reporter: Another argument is that people just don't like needles and shots and that is a valid concern, but they do make the flu mist. A quick skirt up the nose and you're good to go. Lisa sylvester, cnn, washington. 
>>> Coming up in our next hour, teaching students about germs and how they spread. One inventive teacher is using glitter to show students how the flu gets around. 
>>> And adding to flu fears out west is some wicked weather. In phoenix, a freeze warning is in effect until tuesday while overnight temperatures in san FRANCISCO HOVERED IN THE LOW 20s Threatening crops. 
>> Right now we're probably two weeks from the end of our harvest, so, maybe 15 to 20% of the crop would be lost. 
>> Meanwhile, in spokane, washington, no, this is not a parking lot. A frlayer of snow that turned into ice and sent nearly 20 cars crashing entoeach other. In reno, nevada, roads are so icy that traffic is backed up for hours. Troopers responding to dozens of accidents. 
>>> Look at this whiteout in north dakota. Warning drivers to go slowly or just stay inside. The expected high today in north dakota, 0. 
>>> Ousted egyptian president hosni mubarak won a retrial during the 2011 revolution. Responsible for the murders by government security forces. Both were sentenced to life in prison. The retrial based on the same evidence, but this time judges will be allowed to consider mubarak's health. He recently broke his ribs in a fall. His trial drew the world's attention because he was the first arab leader to be jailed by his own people and he appeared in court lying on a hospital bed confined to a cage. I'm joined now by cairo by sarah. Early afternoon where you are. What is the reaction there? 

[00:07:06]


>> So far, a lot of uncertainty about how there will be no evidence submitted to the court. Mubarak that there is new evidence that could be accepted by the court. But everyone is wondering about the fact, the fact-finding commission mohammed horsy and whether the evidence accepted by the court or not. 
>> Do we have any idea how quickly this retrial might happen? 
>> The lawyer estimates it should take place within two months, not before that. 
>> Egypt certainly has struggled to move to democracy. Most recently the controversy over the new constitution there. How could a mubarak retrial like this affect the country's political stability? 
>> Whenever there is something important happening in the cotry, whether his health condition or the course of his trial or now retrial. Definitely creates something different from the constitution regarding the new elections they expected this year and now people will have something else to talk about. Depending on how the trial, the new trial will develop, it would affect the current government whether negatively or positively. Most people have been looking for president mohammed morsi in terms of bringing justice to the victims and the people who were killed during the course of the uprising 2011. 
>> Sarah surgany in cairo, thank you. 
>>> Tomorrow lance armstrong is expected to sit down at his home in texas with oprah. For years, armstrong has repeatedly and aggressively denied doping and last fall he was stripped of his seven tour de FRANCE TITLES. He distanced himself from his popular cancer charity, livestrong. Noare questioning whether it's a good idea to turn to celebrities to gain support for different causes. In about 15 minutes from now, we'll talk with john sang, who worked with lance armstrong to inspire cancer survivors. 

[00:09:23]


>>> Relatives of computer prodigy aaron swartz are shocked after learning of his suicide. He was just 14 and also pioneered the availability of free information online. He was facing federal fraud charges from the articles fro m.I.T. He faced 35 years in prison and a million dollar fine. Swartz denied those claims. 
>>> Hugo chavez is not in a coma and "continuing to make strides in his recovery." That's according to the venezuelan president's older brother. He visited his brother in havana where he went for cancer surgery. Rumor that the family plans to take the president off life support are "totally false." Hugo chavez hasn't been seen in public for weeks. On thursday he missed his own inauguration. 
>>> What do cockroaches and congress have in common? We'll show you next. 
>>> But it's not all bad news in the nation's capital. Hollywood is giving them something to crow about. Even if the accolades are built around a flawed perception. Connecting to the global phenomenon we call the internet of everything. ?????? ?????? it's going to be amazing. And exciting. And maybe, most remarkably, not that far away. We're going to wake the world up. And watch, with eyes wide, as it gets to work. Cisco. Tomorrow starts here. ringing) good afternoon. Chase sapphire.

singing: Two Tickets to... Paradiiiiiise! No four. Remember? Whoooa whooaa whooo! You know Ronny, folks who save hundreds of dollars by switching to GEICO sure are happy. And how happy are they Jimmy? Happier than Eddie Money running a travel agency. Get happy. Get GEICO. Fifteen minutes could save you fifteen percent or more. ?????? ?????? ?????? We're lucky, It's not every day you find a companion as loyal as a Subaru. Love. It's what makes a Subaru, a Subaru. uh-oh. 
[ Male Announcer ] WHEN DIARRHEA HITS, Kaopectate stops it fast. Powerful liquid relief speeds to the source. Fast! 
[ Male Announcer ] STOP THE UH-OH FAST With kaopectate. 
>>> Good morning, atlanta. Welcome back to "early start" weekend. Another glorious day in atlanta and might even top yesterday. Yesterday was about 76 degrees. Actually broke a record, 123 years ago with 75 degrees on JANUARY 12th. And then yesterday was 76. That record had been set back in 1890. Doing the math for you there this morning. Glad you're with us. 

[00:14:01]


>>> The u.S. Treasury department will not mint a $1 trillion platinum coin to avoid defaulting on the country's debt. People have speculated the trillion dollar coin could be a loophole for the congress. It doesn't believe the law can or should be used to make platinum coins to avoid an increase in the debt limit. 
>>> On tuesday, vice president biden is expected todeliver recommendations from his gun task force to the president. Biden was in meetings last week with gun control supporters. Gun rights groups, movie industry leaders and video game leaders. All an effort to prevent more mass shooting. So, here are some examples of what could be on that list of recommendations. Universal background checks and closing the gun show loophole. Also the white house is believed to favor a ban on assault weapons and high capacity magazines. 
>>> Another major issue facing e new congress, marco rubio lays out a plan for revamping the immigration system. The first term republican tells "wall street journal" his plan is designed to meet the country's economic needs by expanding the pool of skilled and agricultural workers. Citizenship for undocumented immigrants that live here now. But rubio says it is not blanket amnesty. To earn legal status immigrants without proper papers would have to undergo a background check and also pay a fine and pay back taxerove they lived in the u.S. For an extended period and understand some english. President obama has promised to dive into an immigration overhaul, as well, this year. 
>>> Well, we've said it before, congress is unpopular, but worse than cockroaches? Apparently. New numbers from public policy polling pitted congress against the worst of the worst. They found congress was less popular than brusal sprouts and used car salesman. But even worse, people have a higher opinion of cockroaches, replacement referees and root canals. So, what did congress beat out? Lindsay lohan, lobbyists and the kardashians. Not very complimentary. But there seems to be one place that people really like washington, at the movies. Cnn chris lawrence reports, hollywood's portrayal of washington may be just a little off base. 

[00:16:22]


>> Maybe they ran out of super heroes or aliens weren't available. 
>> There are only bad options. It's about finding the best one. 
>> Reporter: Hollywood is turning to government analysts to anchor its hit films. 
>> Mia, this is joseph bradley. 
>> Reporter: Former cia officers admit the agency virginia headquarters isn't exactly a tourist destination. 
>> Most of what the american people learn or think they know about the cia comes from hollywood. 
>> Reporter: What do movie goers take away from "zero dark thirty." 
>> Pretty accurate betrayal. 
>> Ouch says those who work at the agency. 
>> This is not the life I lived. 
>> Reporter: He said don't sign up to gallivant around the world. 
>> If you want to spend 99% of your time doing pain staking research, building a case, understanding a problem. That 1%, though, at the end of the game, is pretty, is pretty much like what you might see in the movies. That's exciting. 
>> Reporter: Not just spies. America's 16th president has been around for years. But hollywood spotlight on lincoln's political life could mean gold come oscar time. 
>> You are more, so low, in fact, that the foot of man is incapable of crushing you. 
>> How dare you. 
>> Reporter: Critics and movie goers cheered the insalts that went into passing the 13th amendment. But the good will n't translate to today's politicians. Can you believe telemarketers have higher approval ratings than congress? 
>> No you can't! 
>> Reporter: Sorry, mr. Speaker, it's true. You know who is not a fan of d.C.'S focus? Iran. They're making their own version of "argo." The story of the american diplomats following the iranian revolution. They told the story that ben affleck told as inaccurate. 

[00:18:26]


>>> Using celebrity to promote a cause. One man questioning if that's really a good idea after the controversy surrounding disgrace cyclist lance armstrong. We'll talk with him. See, I figured low testosterone would decrease my sex drive... But when I started losing energy and became moody... That's when I had an honest conversation with my doctor. We discussed all the symptoms... Then he gave me some blood tests. Showed it was low t. That's it. It was a number -- not just me.

>>> Welcome back. 21 minutes past the hours. Sports headlines. It's january and that means playoffs. Did you catch this thriller in denver. Ravens knock out the broncos in an unforgettable double overtime. Baltimore has another tough game ahead of them. Look at him go facing off with the winner of today's patriots/texans game. 
>>> And in the second playoff game yesterday. THE 49ers SEALED THEIR SPOT Running over long-time rivals, the packers. 45-31. Setting a new record for rushing yards by a quarterback in any game. Regular season or postseason and scrambled for 149 yards. The niners will play the seahawks or the falcons next sunday.

>>> But the real sports talker today is this new bombshell report about lance armstrong. "Usa today" saying the cyclist will admit to doping in an interview tomorrow with oprah winfrey. And, remember, armstrong has always denied using drugs. His admission could have serious consequences here. John sang joins me now from washington. Good morning to you. You worked with armstrong when your health care pr firm teamed up with him between 1999 and 2005. You wrote an op-ed calling for lance to come clean. Do you think armstrong will admito doping and, if so, why now? 
>> Well, I think, good morning to you, randi. I think it really remains to be seen whether he will admit to doping or how much more he'll elaborate in just the performance enhancements that he undertook during all his competitive period. 
>> In your op-ed. Let me just read a little bit of it here. You said the following now, however, lance's cancer advocacy efforts sour me on the idea that we need big names to gain support for causes and diseases. Perhaps it's not heroes like lance to whom we should turn for inspiration but everyday cancer survivors are the ones who deserve accolades. 
>> We work would our client over this phase of five years and five of those years with lance armstrong and what was called the tour of hope. It was a 32-mile, I'm sorry, 3,200-mile bicycle ride for three years running across the u.S. That gave us the opportunity to not only work with lance armstrong. But work with literally dozens and dozens and dozens of cancer survivors and people affected by cancer. Onkologists, oncologist nurses. People who were good bike riders as we would go in this tour of hope. The crowds would come out to meet lance, but sometimes the last applauses were for the cancer survivors themselves. People challenging cancer and it was very, very moving to all of us. 

[00:25:06]


>> But the lance armstrong foundation has raised about $500 million to fight cancer, selling more than 80 million yellow wrist bands. Can you say he has done a lot of good in the fight against cancer? 
>> There's no question that he's done just an awesome job raising cancer to the highest profiles, I believe. I think my concern in the gist of my article in the "washington post" from yesterday is at the end of the day, I think it comes down to integrity and if we lose faith in our institutions and our leadership, you know, i think that in this case, randi, the ends don't necessarily justify the means. I'm a firm believer in integrity and believability. 
>> Do you believe he let down cancer survivers and cancer patients? 
>> After the article ran the "washington post" yesterday the response I received and my e-mail inbox has been, I'm not exaggerating. 99% in favor of the position that I took, I think there are many angry people out there, many disappointed people out there. That's why I think that the whole point thatwe don't need celebrities, movie stars, you know, superstar athletes to really get across and emphasize the importance of cancer research and getting volved in cancer clinical trials. 
>> John seng, thank you very much for your time this morning. Nice to see you.

>> We talked about immunity if they negotiate a status of forces. Are you ready to agree to immunity for u.S. Forces? The president in his press conference with you made it very clear. No immunity, no u.S. Troops. 
>> I can go to the afghan people and tell them that, well, if we are to ask a u.S. Presence in afghanistan, for that broader security and stability, there are things that they want in return. And immunity is the principal thing that they want. I will argue for it. I can tell you with relatively good confidence they will say, all right, let's do it. 
>> You could sell it. 
>> I could argue for it, I would sell it and I'm sure they would understand. 
>> Do you envision after 2014 there being no troops? No u.S. Troops in afghanistan? 
>> No. I don't envision that. Need to have a limited number of forces in afghanistan. 

[00:32:29]


>> How many is limited in your mind? 
>> Well, we -- it's not for us to decide. It's for the united states to decide what number of troops they will be keeping in afghanistan and the troops in afghanistan.

>>> Welcome back, everybody. Good morning, washington. Great shot there of our capitol building. Lights are on. Little foggy there this morning, but hopefully a nice day for all the folks in washington. Glad you're with us here on "early start" weekend. This part of the show is going to be fun. Cats, it seems like they only like you when you only have food and they rub up against you on your time and they can completely worthless when you're trying to get work done on your computer, of course. Take a look at my little guy, his name is browser. He likes to park himself there on my laptop. Can't get anything done when he is around. Is he up to anything more sinister could he be plotting to kill me? I'm joined by matthew inman author of the new book "how to tell if your cat is plotting to kill you." What a great title to the book. But before we get to that and before we find out if our cats are trying to kill us, explain to us what the oatmeal is this. This is your website. 

[00:42:54]


>> Just kind of a collection of comics that I put together over the past couple of years. Anything that I think I can make funny, I put into that website. So, sometimes that's comics and sometimes that's longer form stuff. 
>> You probably got a great response and that gave rise to some of these books? 
>> Exactly. I made the website and, you know, it was popular enough that they eventually turned it into some books. That's what I do now. 
>> You had many cats over the years. How many did you say? 
>> When we were kids, we had 17 cats in my house. And we had one litter box, which I cleaned for a decade. 
>> Why cats? Why are cats so popular in your books and in general? 
>> I don't know. It's almost like these adorable little serial killerserms of their behaviors. I was at the zoo a couple years ago and I was looking at the big cats, tigers, cougars, things like that. They look like our cats and move like our cats. Instinctively you want to go in their cage and pet them and play with them, but if you did that with a bengal ti I find that wouldn't work out. 
>> So, you think they're mini serial killers. How can you tell if your cat is trying to kill you? Are there things to look for? 
>> In the book I write about, you know when your cat pushes his paws on you, he's checkal your internal organs for weaknesses. 
>> Oh, my goodness. Okay. Any other ways to know? 
>> You know, the whole, when they use the little box they don't seem to understand they don't need to kick sand all over the entire room. I believe it's because they're practicing burying bodies. Just some things to look out for. 
>> I believe we have some of your comics here. Some of them are pretty funny. One, how to tell if your cat is a mountain lion, in addition to what we have up here on the screen. 
>> We used to have this cat growing up named jackie and she would disappear in the woods for days and come back with sticks in her hair and ate dog food and took down huge animals twice her size. This cat thingshe is either a dog or mountain lion. How to look at your cat and identify whether it thinks it's one of these bigger predators. 

[00:45:14]


>> Why cats love reflebtive surfaces like windows. What can you tell us about that? 
>> Like a vending machine and the birds would hit it and a pile of treats underneath the window. 
>> We are going to do a little self-analysis. I want you to look at some photo s of my cat and I want your professional opinion. That's browser. He likes to get real close. He looks kind of sinister there. Do you think he's trying to kill me? 
>> I think so. Look in their eyes and do you see love, compassion? Murderous rage? It's like they can't make up their mind whether they want to kill you or love you. 
>> What does it tell you when they're rubbing on you and we did the kneading thing. They are all over you. 
>> Maybe plotting your demise. He may not know he is in the middle. 
>> Should you look him straight in the eye? 
>> I wouldn't recommend doing that. If they have a staring contest, let the cat win. 
>> Good advice. Matthew inman, nice to see you. Thank you. 
>> Thanks for having me.

>> Good morning, randi. Wounds remain fresh here in newtown, yet the community continues to find ways to help each other heal. The touching memorials we all became so familiar with are gone. But they will serve a new purpose. Toys, candles, handmade signs and more are being mulched and preserved and will become part of a new permanent memorial one day. Meanwhile, a makeshift memorial marked lie a large american flag has been set up alongside one of newtown's main roads. We have been asked to keep a respectful distance, and we are.

=======================================================

Rk has seen more t 19,000 flu cases this season. 
>>> Well, if you've finally decided to get a flu shot, you might have to do some hunting around. The health department in one illinois cnty is running out of the vaccine for adults and for kids and officials don't plan to order any more. Take a listen to this. 
>> We have a limited supply of children's vaccine injectible, when do not have any nasal spray children's right now. There are vaccines available in the area. I do believe other health dements in the area may have vaccines and pharmacy have limited supply. 
>> At schools across the country, administrators, teachers and nurses are finding themselves on the front lines of the flu epidemic. Our brian todd spoke with several officials about what they're doing to defend against the outbreak. 
>> Cynthia norris knows she has to get creative. She has to keep a nationwide flu outbreak from slamming into her school. With this small group of kids ages 6 to 11, it's the visual that counts. She spreads glitter on her desk. 
>> Then I'm going to put my hands in it and that represents the germs. The germs that we don't see, okay. So, if I come and I touch you, this glitter being the germs will be what I pass on to you and you could potentially get sick. Okay. Now, my phone rings I pick up the phone. Now, after I put it down, look at that. What does that represent? 
>> Germs. 
>> As a registered nurse in maryland, norris is like a field commander against the flu. Her other tactics. Culling sheets and demoes on hand washing. Sanitizer dispensers all over the place. 
>> What do you think of this? Does it help you? 
>> Yes, because like when you clean hands, you make sure it's clean and you don't get a lot of germs. 
>> Do you find a lot of this hard to remember to try to prevent the flu? 

[00:02:01]


>> Reporter: No. The region of the country that the centers for disease control has been among the hardest hit. School district officials say one out of every five students there has had to stay home recently with flu-like symptoms. 
>> We are working hard to try to find kids that maybe have symptoms in the district and having our nurse looking and checking those kids out and sending those kids home, if need be. 
>> Cynthia norris said the most common way flu spreads in schools, kids touching each other with droplets from sneezing or sniffling on their hands. Sharing food or other items and just close proximity to others. Mistakes are made by parents, too. Do a lot of parents who have a kid on the borderline, do they err on the side of sending them to school? 
>> They do. They do. Sometimes the kids, I told my mom I wasn't feeling good. Oh, you'll be okay. They'll send them to school. So, a lot of times they're just not keeping them home that 24-hour period after they have a fever. 
>> Reporter: A mistake also made norris says by many teachers who don't stay home when they're sick. As bad as this outbreak has been, health officials in some school districts across the united states including this one say they may have caught a break. They say just before the kids broke for the holidays they noticed more flu-like symptoms and more widespread symptoms but since the kids have come back from vacation, they have noticed fewer cases, at least in some districts. The holidays may have been a mitigating factor keeping kids away from each other and keeping the flu from spreading, at least in some cases. 
>> And flu fears are increasing out west where a cold snap has paralyzed parts of the region. In california, some areas had near record low temperatures overnight, according to the national weather service. Frost and freeze warnings extended as far south as san diego and temperatures reached THE LOW 20s IN SOME PLACES. That could be a huge problem for the state's citrus crops. Here is our affiliate ktxl in sacramento.

>> Reporter: For harvesters, every day is a race against the clock. Pick as many oranges as you can before sun down. But early morning, raising temperatures means these harvesters can't start picking until 9:00 a.M. Two hours after their regular schedule. 
>> It's really bad because we don't care working like that. 
>> Reporter: Less work means less pay. On top of that, freezing temperatures could spoil what's left of their harvest. 
>> Right now we're probably two weeks from the end of our harvest. So, maybe 15% to 20% of the crop will be lost. 
>> Reporter: The owner of mandarin hill orchards, tom, isn't too worried about that. In order for these crops to completely damage, freezing temperatures must last longer than eight hours. 
>> The inside of the tree won't be affected as much as the outside of the tree. 
>> Reporter: But even some freezing temperatures could leave the oranges soft, even though they're perfectly fine. Fewer consumers will buy them leaving a bigger burden on harvesters. 
>> It's really hard to find a job right now. You know. But we are working. 
>> And tomorrow lance armstrong is expected to sit down for an interview with oprah at his home in austin, texas. He may finally spill the beans. "Usa today" says armstrong will admit to using performance enhancing drugs throughout his career. The once popular cyclist has been stripped of his seven tour de FRANCE TITLES. The interview with oprah is set to air on her network on thursday. 
>>> Ousted egyptian president hosni mubarak has won a retrial on charges tied to the killing of peaceful demonstrators during the 2011 revolution. A court last june found mubarak and his interior minister responsible for the murders by government security forces. Both were sentenced to life in prison. The retrial will be based on the very same evidence, but this time judges will be allowed to consider mubarak's health. The 86-year-old recently broke his ribs in a fall. The trial drew the world's attention because he was the first arab leader to be jailed by his own people and because he appeared in court lying on a hospital bed and confined to a cage.

>>> The golden globe awards are this evening. Host tina fey and amy poehler gave a little insight into why they decided to host this year's ceremony. 
>> Well, we decided to host because the golden globes seem like they're pretty fun. 
>> We've been to them before and it's a very kind of sloppy, loud party and that seemed like our kind of thing. 
>> And as it turns out, the same two men who are producing the oscar ceremony will be at the golden globes tonight. Their show "smash" is up for an award. 
>> Your show, "smash" is nominated for best television series, comedy or musical. Are you going tonight? 
>> Absolutely. 
>> Yep. 
>> We're really excited. 
>> I'm leaving here and going home and changing. 
>> Now, you have been nominated and won so many awards throughout your careers. Is it still so exciting to be nominated? 
>> You know, we're so proud of "smash" and so proud that it's being recognized by the hollywood foreign press that, yeah, it's really, really exciting because we think that to do what all the great people on "smash" do is quite an achievement and it's so great for all of us to be acknowledged. 
>> Besides the show being something that we're so proud of and excited about producing, we're really excited and proud of the fact that we share our producing credit with steven spielberg. Who created the show in concept and in vision. It was his idea to do the show and he called us and invited us one day to partner with him and produce the show with him. 
>> And let's talk logistics for a moment. You're producing the oscar ceremony in february. Will you watch tonight's golden globe ceremony and looking at how it might impact your award ceremony? 
>> No, basically the golden globes is a separate entities as is the oscars. THE GOLDEN GLOBES HONORS TVs AND Movies and more informal than the academy awards and the oscars. And because people sit at the table and they eat a meal and they drink and it is more of a party. The oscars are kind of its own being. And it is, it is the ultimate. I mean, the golden globe could be a step to the oscar. 

[00:12:00]


>> Tina fey and amy poehler will host the golden globes and they have a long, successful career as a comeadic duo. Will you look at their performance and see how it impact seth's at the academy award? 
>> I think amy poehler and tina fey are brilliant and brilliant choice to host the golden globes and we think we've gone in a different direction and we've made it a choice that we're very proud of in going with seth. I think they're all really talented comedians, but we think seth is very different from them. So, we think it's going to be quite dissimilar. 
>> And who do you think are going to be the big winners tonight at the golden globes? 
>> Oh, you know, we're hoping ann athway is acknowledged, we're hoping "smash" is acknowledged and there is, again, this is, this year has been an embarrassment of riches for great talent and everybody's worthy and I think there will be a lot of surprises. 
>> And you say that the golden globes are often seen as a forecast for big winners at the oscars. Do you think the winners a tonight's golden globe ceremony will also be big during your academy award ceremony? 
>> Traditionally there has been some overlap there. So, it's just, we will just be watching to see who the winners are and be better informed to respond once we see that. 
>> The big difference, though, in both shows, of course, is that the golden globes involves television, as well as movies and then the movies are divided into two categories where it's all oscars. It's movies, only, not television. And there's one category that covers every movie. 

[00:14:01]


>> Thank you so much for joining us. 
>> Certainly. 
>> Thanks for inviting us. 
>> You can catch the golden globes tonight. 
>>> Peyton manning, aaron rodgers, two big name quarterbacks you won't find in the nfl playoffs but russell wilson is still going strong. The only rookie quarterback left in the playoffs. Who is he? We'll look at this rising star. 
>>> First, it is official, you can now use a smartphone everywhere. Yes, if planes, cars, gyms and the dinner table weren't already enough, you can now tweet and check your e-mail in the shower. I'm not kidding. Dan simon has been on gadget overload at the consumer electronic show in las vegas and here are some of the coolest things he's found.

>>> That was certainly a big day in the world of basketball, but, now, to the nfl playoffs where big name quarterbacks are falling by the wayside. Peyton manning is out and so is last year's mvp, aaron raunlers. That means post-season glory could fall to russell wilson, instead. You might be asking who is russell wilson. Carlos daz has the introduction. 
>> Reporter: He's the only rookie quarterback left in the playoffs and his name is russell wilson. 
>> A lot to be excited about. 
>> Reporter: That's an understatement at only 5'11", wilson has less than ideal height for nfl quarterback. One of the reasons he lasted into the third round of the draft until he was picked by seattle. 
>> He made everyone around him better. He had tremendous athleticism. I mean, he had a canon arm. He made good decisions. A lot of times he made the coaches look good by decisions he made. 
>> Reporter: Russell carried those traits to the nfl where the seahawks realized he was the best quarterback on the team and named him the starter just before the season. 
>> This game is not easy. Especially playing the quarterback position, playing as a rookie. It's as hard asit gets. You have to mentally be tough and be on that constant quest for knowledge and attention to detail and that's what I tried to bring to the table. 
>> Reporter: With 26 touchdown passes in the regular season, he tied peyton manning's nfl rookie record. The difference? Manning's team wasn't two wins away from the super bowl. 
>> I'm happy to play every day i wake up. Wherever, whenever. That's the opportunity we have in front of us. 
>> Thank you to hln's carlos diaz for that report. Russell wilson has a fallback option if he gets tired of football. He was drafted a few years ago to play baseball for the colorado rockies.

=======================================================

Ur. Tale of two countries right here in the u.S. Cubans on the move. Travel restrictions are changing. Wonderful news for wonder bread lovers. The politics of some golden globe films. And the honor goes to -- new york. Details on all those stories throughout the hour. But first, the battle is ratcheting up today over chuck hagel's nomination as defense secretary. Here's former secretary of state colin powell on "meet the press." 
>> I he gets confirmed. I think ultimately he's superbly qualified based on his overall record, based on his service to the country, based on how he feels about troops and veterans and families. I think he will do a great job as secretary of defense. And I think in his confirmation hearings all of these issues that you've raised, that others have raised, he'll be prepared to deal with. 
>> Also new today, senator john McCAIN OFFERING NEW INSIGHT INTO His concern about this nomination. 
>> Wha his view of america's role in the world? Whether he really believes that the surge was the worst blunder since the vietnam war. That clearly is not -- that's not correct. I mean, in fact, it's bizarre. Why would he oppose calling the iranian revolutionary guard a terrorist organization? These are legitimate questio that need to be asked. I honor his service. We are friends. But I have an obligation to the men and women who are now serving in uniform. 
>> Let's go now to nbc news white house correspondent peter alexander. So peter, with a good sunday to you, my friend. Lots of reaction on the sunday talk shows on this hagel fight. Has it reached a new level, and do you think this suggests it's going to be a bit tougher than the president envisioned to get him passed, get this nomination through? 
>> It's a good question. I had a conversation with a vrn administration official a short time ago, and he made it clear he was referring specifically to the gun control issue that they know, referring to that and others, that none of these issues are going to be easy, but the president is certainly going to push ahead. As we speak right now, the president is pushing ahead with his sunday morning off to play basketball with some of his friends. But the defense he finds on the court is going to be a lot different than the opposition he's finding in congress right,000. As you noted, colin powell today speaking to david gregory referred to his -- referred to chuck hagel's distinguished public service record bricking up a point that the president has made very clear, sort of i guess telegraphing you could say what the argument would be for hagel, the fact that he was a vietnam vet, would be the first vet with a purple heart to be able to serve as the secretary of defense. It's very clear that the president feels strongly that these are the people that he wants serving on his behalf, specifically as it comes to chuck hagel, as he will represent the enlisted men and women who serve for the u.S. Military. 

[00:02:44]


>> Hmm. We have to talk debt ceiling, peter, because there's been this talk of minting that trillion-dollar coin. That is now off the table. So is the white house looking at another big fight here, and do you think if so it's on par with what we saw at the fiscal cliff? 
>> I think in many ways this one could be a lot more significant. This could be a lot more difficult than the fiscal cliff. There was a deadline for that and that was an issue that a lot of people felt would be resolved ultimately in some form the way that it was. The debt ceiling crisis does sort of put these o'two sides, the republicans and democrats and the white house and congress head to head. Once again right now, the republicans have insisted that the only way they will raise that debt ceiling past the 16.4 trillion mark where it is right now is if they get dollar for-dollar spending cuts that match that raise. The president has said, his press secretary has said, they will not negotiate on this issue. On the fiscal cliff issue they were willing to negotiate. There were obviously conversations behind the scenes. We know the leaders of congress came here to the white house. On the debt ceiling issue it is dramatically different. And on top of that you also have two other issues where these two sides will be going head to head. Again, the issue of sequester. And obviously, the continuing resolution, basically the way the government is paid for going forward. So we've got a busy couple months ahead of us. 
>> We do. Hey, peter, we have to take note that we're going to see you in a little more dressed down, little more casualde of you at the bottom of the hour for office politics. For anyone who wants to see what goes on behind the scenes with you, tune in. Are you nervous? 
>> I think I have a pretty good sense how this is going to go. I was more nervous when you came here-p but I know you took good care of me. It will be all right. 
>> It will. It will be interesting for folks who stick around. Thanks, peter. 
>> Thanks, alex. 
>> Carol lee and associate politics editor for roll call david drucker. Welcome to both of you. 
>> Good morning. 
>> Carol, I'll speak with you first. As the president says, he's not going to use his executive powers to raise the debt ceiling. Treasury department on saturday said we're not going to be minting a trillion-dollar coin to help meet the government's spending obligations. So that means the debt ceiling is going to have to be raised by congress. How ugly is this fight going to get? 

[00:04:51]


>> It's going to -- I agree with peter. It's probably going to be worse than what we saw in 2011. Despite -- the white house has been very casual about this saying the president's not going to negotiate over the debt ceiling, he did that in 2011, he's not going to do that again, they've tried to rally business to their side, business leaders to their side so that they can box in republicans on this issue when it comes up, but the bottom line is there are a number of things that republicans want, particularly after they didn't get the kinds of spending cuts that they wanted out of the fiscal cliff deal at the end of the year, and they're going to use the debt ceiling as their leverage. And interesting -- one interesting thing to watch for in all this is how the republican leaders in congress handle this because there are -- the republican leaders don't want a huge fight over the debt ceiling. But the rank-and-file members do. So how they navigate that is going to have a huge impact on how this plays out, but it's going to be a tremendous fight. And the idea that the president's going to not get to negotiate over the debt ceiling, it's not going to happen. 
>> Well, to that end, what carol's saying, david, there are some in the gop who have suggested a partial government shutdown may be needed to get the spending cuts that they want. Do you think that's where we're headed? 
>> Well, I think it's very possible. If you look at how the fiscal cliff played out, as carol noted, republicans didn't get a number of things they were shooting for on their end. So politically, as well as substantively, the fiscal cliff, the debt ceiling I should say, then becomes their next avenue for being able to extract what they want out of the administration in terms of spending cuts and paring down the size and scope of government. If you look at this from a republican's point of view, not only do they want to get things substantively because of where they feel the country is at from a debt perspective and a spending perspective, politically there is no motivation, there's no reward for them simply backing down and unilaterally giving the president what he wants. Therefore, I do expect this to be a very tough battle, even though the public may side with the president, on this it doesn't give -- republicans have nothing to gain by simply giving him what he wants. And I t that they're preparing to go to the mat. And I think one of the reasons they've talked about a partial government shutdown is they're trying to in a sense prepare the country for what they're willing to do and to send a message to the president that they're not afraid of this even though it could be politically very treacherous. 

[00:07:17]


>> Carol, I'm curious looking ahead to tuesday we have the remaining $50 billion in hurricane sandy relief. That's heading to the house floor. There are some fears, certainly legitimate ones, that the relief could be stalled by house republicans. What could be the holdup? 
>> Well, again it comes down to spending. And there are some house republicans who want the disaster relief to be linked to either spending cuts or some reforms in the way the government hands out aid. I mean, typically these things aren't really fights. When something is considered an emergency and for disaster relief it's not used to get spending cuts to offset it. So we're now in a situation where again republicans are wanting to make an issue of spending cuts and they're looking at this disaster relief as a potential place to do that. And they were somewhat embarrassed at the beginning of the year when speaker boehner sent them home and they didn't vote on this and again it's another instance where the republican party is a little divided on this because you had some -- particularly governor chris christie of new jersey but then also some house republicans in the new york area who were really adamant that this was not the right way to play this game and then eventually the house republicans had to come back and vote on that package. This is the second piece of that. And there are some republicans who are willing to, again, fight to try and get some spending cuts or reforms in the way aid is handed out. 
>> Okay. To your point about look, we've got gone through this before in terms of dealing with disasters, there are the victims of superstorm sandy which held the rallies this weekend. They're pushing coness to pass this relief package. They point out it took ten days for congress to pass aid for katrina victims. In fact, listen to this. 
>> Here we stand, victims of sandy, 75 days later, still waiting. We are suffering. Families are homeless. People are without jobs and struggling. 
>> Where the heck is the red tape being cut? Because I sure haven't seen it. My neighbors haven't seen it. My friends haven't seen it. We are still fighting. 

[00:09:20]


>> Again, katrina, ten days it took to pass. So david, do you think this is a fight that some republicans want to have? Given some in their own party, high-profile figures as well from new york and new jersey. They want this passed quickly. 
>> Well, it's become an uncomfortable fight. One of the things that's changed over the past seven years or so is that we're in a much different position from a deficit and debt point of view. So there's much more resistance on the republican side than there used to be. To all of the little riders and pieces of pork that are loaded into these disaster relief bills. And that's some of the changes we've seen in terms of these things being held up. An easy way to do this, and it's hard to get an agreement on this in the senate-s just to pass a clean disaster relief bill with nobody else's projects in there. Having said that, republicans need to be careful. There are a number of republican house seats in new jersey and new york that could be threatened if republicans are perceived as holding up aid to sandy. And it's just not anywhere they really want to be when they're trying to focus on a debt ceiling fight or at least they should be. And I think from a political point of view and even substantively they have much bigger -- they have much bigger things to go after and try and accomplish than being perceived as callous when you have so many people in the northeast that don't have functional homes in the dead of winter. 
>> Quickly changing topics, carol, your latest article you indicate chuck hagel accompanied then senator obama to iraq and afghanistan in july 2008. This was in part to bolster mr. Obamas foreign policy kreds. And it happened when the president was runninggainst senator McCain for president. HOW MUCH OF senator McCain's concern about chuck hagel becoming defense secretary is on actual policy and how much might be lingering resentment, perhaps? 
>> Well, it's a little bit of both, right? It's a classic washington. You know, there are certainly policy differences between the two, particularly on iraq, but you know, when senator hagel took then senator obama, went with him to iraq and afghanistan in the middle of the 2008 campaign, it really angered senator McCain. And you know, senator hagel didn't come out and explicitly endorse barack obama, but that trip was seen as an endorsement, as you'll recall. Obama was trying to get some foreign policy credentials and build up that resume. McCAIN CERTAINLY HAD THAT. So it's a mixture for sure. 

[00:11:43]


>> David, do you think chuck hagel will be confirmed? 
>> I think he'll be confirmed. I think it will be rough and republicans will use it, as well as some democrats. But think ultimately he gets confirmed. 
>> Okay. Carol lee and david drucker, good to see you boeing. Thanks so much. 
>> Thank you. 
>> West coast headlines are next. With ast in a reading, writing, and rapping. Also politics and film. Did torture scenes in "zero dark thirty" play a role in oscar nominations and should they have? The studio that made that film is now angry. me, you know it can be hard to breathe, and how that feels. Copd includes chronic bronchitis and emphysema. Spiriva helps control my copd symptoms by keeping my airways open for 24 hours. Plus, it reduces copd flare-ups. Spiriva is the only once-daily inhaled copd maintenance treatment that does both. Spiriva handihaler tiotropium bromide inhalation powder does not replace fast-acting inhalers for sudden symptoms. Tell your doctor if you have kidney problems, glaucoma, trouble urinating, or an enlarged prostate. These may worsen with spiriva. Discuss all medicines you take, even eye drops. Stop taking spiriva and seek immediate medical help if your breathing suddenly worsens, your throat or tongue swells, you get hives, vision changes or eye pain, or problems passing urine. Other side effects include dry mouth and constipation. Nothing can reverse copd. Spiriva helps me breathe better.

>>> some headlines making news out on the west coast. The santa cruz sentinel" in cal has the headline, "gun control a loaded argument." The authors of the article ask several experts if we are safer against an intruder with a gun in our hands. The "daily courier in" prescott, arizona writes aboutarry goldwater's photographs, an exhibit that opened this weekend features photographs taken by the conservative senator. Most of the photos are portraits of the navajo heem and pictures of the arizona landscape. The "los angeles times" has a story about how the university of arizona is the first in the country to offer a minor degree in hip-hop. The school added that concentration toyotas africana studies program. It's part of a trend to give serious academic study to the subject. That's kind of fun. 

[00:16:29]


>>> Well, not fun, the new and deadly violence in afghanistan, which has killed at least seven civilians. This in a blast inside a mosque following a night raid by nato and afghan troops. That violence comes amid fresh reaction to an accelerated timeline for u.S. Troops to withdraw from the region. Earlier on "meet the press" colin powell said the u.S. Would need to keep some military personnel on the ground but would not speculate as to the numbers. BUT SENATOR john McCain was more critical. 
>> There's always a tendency in washington on these issues to say 2,000, 4,000, 10,000. That's not the right way to go about it. As a military planner you determine what it is that we have to do, how many advisers you need, what kind of military assistance group do you need, and then you determine what those numbers are. 
>> There's a series of decisions, all of which the president and the vice president have overruled our military leaders and their advice and counsel, which is the president's right to do. But each time I believe that it has ensured the risk of failure. 
>> Nbc's amon mul hachlt din joins me in studio. Uniquely. It's so nice to have you stateside. Thanks for joining us. Who's right here in terms of troop numbers? Based on your practical assessment of what's going on there? 
>> Well, that's a million-dollar question. I think it really begins with what the objectives are. When you hear the military assessment as we've heard from general allen and others, certainly it's several thousands of soldiers that are needed. But it begins with the task, what is the military objective. I think that cuts to the core of what's taking place in the political establishment. Perhaps incoming defense secretary hagel would address thish, of what is the overall objective of the united states presence in afghanistan in the years ahead, whether or not the afghan military is capable of achieving those objectives. And I think because it's unclear and it has remained uncleared for so many years, the fundamental answer to that remains very ambiguous. 
>> So the accelerated withdrawal that ber talking about, does thisean things are better on the ground in afghanistan, it's at a time when we can pull out our troops without leaving them decimated, or is this all about the u.S. Just wants to get out? 

[00:18:38]


>> Well, I think there's no doubt there's war fatigue in the united states. There's no doubt this war has dragged out from the eyes of many people for far too long, has cost far too many lives -- 
>> 11 years. 11 years. More than 2,000 soldiers killed. Billions of dollars spent. And the question is is the united states particularly safer, is afghanistan safer. The short answer to that is yes, to some extent there are. But has the quality of life for afghan people gotten better? And many people make the argument it hasn't. Even president hamid karzai has said to nbc news that the u.S. Is to blame for some of the corruption and insecurity that exists in that country. That's very difficult for the u.S. To hear. But that is certainly the perspective that many in afghanistan and pakistan and in that region share about the u.S. Footprint in that part of the world. 
>> But if the reason we are there in addition to helping stabilize that country is to secure our own security here, what happens if when we pull out afghanistan devolves into civil war? Does that pose threats for us and our security? 
>> Well, absolutely. What we've seen in the past is that when there's a country like afghanistan that is unstable, without a central government, where people can operate in the shadows and plan attacks, the united states is susceptible to that environment. It's not only here in the united states but u.S. Interests around the world. And that's why the u.S. Has to maintain or believes it has to maintain that presence there. There's no doubt that going forward many of these issues are going to come to the surface. Afghanistan could find itself in a very bloody civil war. Iraq after the u.S. Withdrawal has not gotte necessarily better. There's still violence. There are still attacks. But to some extent u.S. Interests are a little more secured as a result of what happened there in the eyes of, you know, the united states officials that pursued that war. So again, you could make the argument that in afghanistan something similar could happen. But there's no doubt a great deal of uncertainty, great deal of questions remain. As to whether or not the central government in afghanistan can actually control the military and preserve the security, integrity of that country. And that remains to be seen. 
>> If only we could predict the future. All right, ayman, good to see you. 
>> Thanks a lot.

>>> Let's go now to weather. And there's a mixed picture out there. Today's temperatures may break record mize for a second straight day but western parts of the country are going to struggle to stay above freezing after reaching record lows. And sandwiched between it all some severe storms. We go to nbc meteorologist dylan dreier here with all the details. 
>> Hi, alex. Yesterday we broke 92 record high temperatures across the eastern half of the country. Today we're going to do it again. Not so much in the northeast. I mean, it will be a lot above average but that fog is hard to shake from new york city right up into boston, and it's windy. That always makes it feel a little cooler. The jackpot for all the really nice air is right down into the southeast. IT'S ALREADY IN THE 60s AND 70s. We're most likely going to break some more records down across florida today. But look at where the cold air is. It is well down into the single digits. Billings, montana with that wind chill it feels like 10 below right now. That is where that cold arctic air is sitting. And it's going to sit there for a while. And as you just mentioned, right in between, we do have this cold frond riding along that front is mostly rain. However, we do still have some icing, some freezing rain falling right through st. Louis and into southern illinois. That is going to create some very, very slick roadways because that freezing rain just makes a glaze on the roads that's very treacherous. But just to the east of that, from nashville right up into bowling green, we have torrential downpours, frequent cloud-to-ground lightning, nothing severe indicated right now, but we do have the potential of severe storms stretching from kentucky into tennessee right down into louisiana once again. An area that has already been hard hit by all of that rain. So today we are looking for highs today to top out well into THE 70s AND 80s DOWN ACROSS THE Southeast. 62 degrees in washington, d.C. Again, that fog in the northeast is going to have it feel a little chilly just like it did yesterday unless you're moving around, but the cold air is sitting back up into minneapolis and the dakotas a it is going to stay there for quite some time. Alex?

>>> Welcome back, everyone, to "weekends with alex witt." Time for hanlheadlines at the half hour. Former president george h.W. Bush may soon be on his way home. Nbc news has confirmed mr. Bush could be discharged as early as this week. The 41st president was hospitalized back on november 23rd for bronc utis and stayed there while doctors monitored a lingering -- 
>>> flu vaccinations. Doctors and pharmacists are giving out the shots at clinics, drug stores, and hospitals. The epidemic is widespread across 47 states. The cdc reports signs of improvement in a few southern states but doctors aren't sure how much worse this epidemic will get. 
>>> In today's strategy talk cabinet conflict. In an interview today senator bob corker raised new questions about chuck hagel, president obama's nominee for secretary of defense. 
>> I think another thing, george, that's going to come up is just his overall temperament and is he suited to run a department or a big agency or a big entity like the pentagon. 
>> Joining me now, former republican congressman tom davis and jonathan alter, msnbc political analyst and a bloomberg view columnist. Welcome to you both. 
>> Hey, alex. 
>> Representative davis, I'll begin with you, sir. We just heard senator corker saying he has questions about chuck hagel's temrament and his ability to run the pentagon. Now, I know you served on the hill about the same time with him. Have you ever heard anything about that? 
>> Well, look, I think beer going to be in a nomination fight at this point. The real question is is he going to be able to come up with five republicans to -- do they want to filibus it? I think right now we're sitting in some uncharted waters in terms of how the republicans in the senate are going to act. It's very clear that the senator has broken some relationships that he used to have with republican senators. So I had a great relationship with senator hagel. We were both from nebraska although my congressional district was virginia, knew him for years, but I didn't work with him day to day. He was over on the senate side. And there are clearly in ruptured relationships over there. Whether it rises to the point of them going to their corners and opposing this thing I think remains to be seen. You also have some -- you also have some issues on the left, you have some of those comments on gay rights and the like. But -- 

[00:32:42]


>> oh, sure. 
>> Dpsh I suspect with being the president's nominee they'll probably be able to patch that together. 
>> But that issue about his temperament, is that news to you? 
>> It's -- I never saw that in the time I worked with it. 
>> Okay. 
>> Jonathan, what do you think? Chuck hagel, does he get nominated? And if he es, is all the political capital that the president may have to use to get this done, is it worth it? 
>> Absolutely worth it. This is an outrage what's going on now. It used to be until very recently unless there was a corruption issue or an issue of gross personal malfeasance, a character issue, the president was assumed to get the team that he wanted. There used to be before this hyperpartisan atmosphere you had to have real reasons to oppose, much less filibuster the president's choice, whoever the president was. So when the congressman says we're in uncharted territory, he's right. We're in a materiality where you have people who've never served in combat, who don't have any idea what it's like to actually be in a war, telling the country that they know better than a highly decorated vietnam veteran who also has a lot of experience in national security affairs. This is a total partisan witch hunt. They are exaggerating things hagel has said in the past completely out of proportion. For instance, they say he used the word the jewish lobby. Now, I'm jewish, alex. That's been used by hundreds of people in the public debate over the years. To depict him as an anti-semite, as some neoconservatives are doing, because he referred to the jewish lobby is absurd. And this really has to end. And the senate has to kind of realize that this is just not the way to proceed. Ask him tough questions but not do this, not slander him. 
>> What we need to understand is we have basically turned into -- in terms of voting habits and reaction to members of congress a parliamentary issue. The founding fathers basically envisioned people coming to agreement and compromise. That's how the constitution came into being. Now everything is partisan and parliamentary. It's a difficult fit. And it's got to -- the president has got to sit down and try to resolve this. It works both sides. I don't know which side started this, but it seems to be getting worse every congress. 

[00:35:10]


>> Jonathan, isn't the point of a cabinet pick to work with the president to help further his agenda? I mean, that's what it is. You may have differences with that but you may take up those differences while working with that person, that cabinet member on the hill or elsewhere. I mean, isn't that what a cabinet member is? 
>> Yes. And we just had an election. And elections have consequences, alex. And I think the congressman is absolutely right that we are now drifting toward a parliamentary system. But we don't have a parliamentary system. We have a different system. And in our system the results of the election are meaningful. And the results of this election should suggest to democrats and republicans that the president, unless there is some egregious problem, deserves to have his own choices in government. 
>> Alex, let me just say, the senate has the responsibility to advise and consent. And given the filibuster rules you have to find five republicans, and he'll find out quickly who his friends are. People forget that this election, the republicans held the house. Although institutionally they have a majority there, given voting rights and the way the districts are created, the president's got to come to grips with that and somehow both sides are going to find their way out of this. It's going to be just two years of being in the ring, exchanging punches. 
>> But ultimately, jonathan, your take on chuck hagel is getting through? It may be a bit of a bruising battle but do you have any concern that he won't? 
>> I think he will -- no, I do have some concern because of the hyperpartisan atmosphere but i think ultimately he will get through. The president will fight for him. He's a good man. He'd be the first enlisted man, former enlisted man -- 
>> vietnam. Yep. 
>> -- To head the pentagon going back to when it was founded in THE LATE '40s, WHEN THE Department of defense was created. He would be the first grunt to be in charge of the pentagon. That's a good thing for america. That's a good perspective to have in that job. 
>> And novel. 
>> For a lot of -- honestly, for a lot of what are called chicken hawks, the super hawks who never served who are now calling chuck hagel an appeaser, it's outrageous. 

[00:37:15]


>> All right, gentlemen. I'm going to switch gears here as the president announced on friday he is accelerating the withdrawal of troops from afghanistan. So when those troops leave, representative, that will be the second war started by a republican president and ended by president obama. Does he deserve credit for that? 
>> Well, I think history's going to judge if we left too soon, what were our goals in afghanistan, what happens to afghanistan once american troops have left. It's a very weighty decision on the part of any president because you're going to get judged ultimately in history by what are the ramifications of that. This was a bipartisan war, too. To put this on a republican president, I think we only had one dissenting vote in the house. This was the step-up, if you will, to the war, the surge was this president's making. So I think ultimately he's going to be judge on what are the outcomes three, four years after we pull out. Is karzai going to be able to preside or are we going to be seeing the taliban come back in and take over, which is what we had before this started? I don't really know how that plays out. I will just say, this having been to afghanistan, it's not a country in the normal sense. Governmental reach is not across the country. It's very, very tribal. These boundaries were cobbled together, and there's not a huge afghan nationalism. It makes it a very difficult situation. 
>> Mm-hmm. 
>> I was just going to say i think the congressman's right that the proof will be in the pudding down the road, but the country essentially made a decision that we did not want to have a long war. Remember, four years ago there were a lot of people in both parties who said let's have a ten-year counterinsurgency commitment in afghanistan, and not just the president but really the american people said we don't really want that, we're tired of war, and so we're going to see it wound down now. 
>> Okay. Jonathan alter and former republican congressman tom davis. Guys, good to sigh both. Thanks so much. 
>>> In this week's office politics, nbc's peter alexander, the network's newest white house correspondent, I talked with peter about the pressure of reporting on the president with the best in the business watching you, not to mention all the west wing staffers. But we started with a behind-the-scenes look at nbc's white house press office such as it is. 

[00:39:24]


>> It's so crowded here. You know, people think about working at the white house as being one of the most glamorous, ultimate jobs, which it is. But maybe the glamorous part you can correct. 
>> I think this is what people would be most surprised, perhaps disappointed to see, is that it's not like we have some giant wing of ow own. We have like a teeny nook in the corner. But it's not terrible. Nobody's complaining. Four people going at once. You'll have chuck todd, kristen welker, myself, a producer will be here, and we'll be side by side by side. Not to mention abc, cbs, fox, we're all slammed in the back corner next to one another. So every so often you can hear the other network under deadline screaming something out -- 
>> and pick up something. You never know. 
>> Usually on sents because they're -- one of the biggest things is when you do these special reports you stand up and here's all the correspondents from the network standing side by side by side all speaking at the same time when they give you the two-minute warning would've the president comes out. Me, ed henry from fox, jaj garrett from cbs, john karl. The president's about to walk through that door and you're all trying to communicate literally three feet away from each other when you're blasting your broadcast voice -- 
>> you hear them, what they're saying -- 
>> it's terrible. I think, having reported in some awful places, this is the hardest thing I have done because you know that behind that door the president and his staff are listening to what you're saying. They're surely watching you because they've asked me about things I've said shortly thereafter. So I know they are. And he walks in the door. It's just -- it is the biggest challenge I think in what we do, is to try to keep your head about you when you're doing that. 
>> Well, that is a lot worse than having nick yell at me in my ear during the show. 
>> When you're away I've filled in. I know what nick sounds like and it can be trouble. 
>> Ooh. 
>> And during the fiscal cliff-hanger, as it were, I'm here, I'm the guys, I'm doing "nightly news" and special reports with brian williams. You hear the music, you hear the chime, you stand up, you talk to brian. The president walks in. You sit down. And you're six feet away from the president of the united states. 

[00:41:29]


>> Does anything go through your mind like I cannot screw this up or I'm a little nervous, I'm I've got to say this exactly right? 
>> I was not a little. I was a lot nervous. Literally to the point that i was shaking a little, shivering. Not that it was -- speaking of the president. But just like this is big stuff you're dealing with here. 
>> Leader of the free world. 
>> So this is any cheat sheet, as it were. I just got one of these. Apparently, this is what white house correspondents have done for years. 
>> Oh so, that will help -- 
>> I usually wear one ifb earpiece. This is double fisting. Double earring if you were. You put it behind you. But in both ears. That way you won't hear -- you only hear brian williams in here and your producer, don't hear these guys. I have not had it. It just arrived yesterday. So the next time you see me at one of those. 
>> Talk about your wife. A newlywed you are because you were just married less than a year ago, so you're technically a newlywed. 
>> Can I show you a little picture? 
>> Of course. You can brag. Allison. She's beautiful. 
>> She's a sweetie. I love her. We parallel parked our wedding between two of the primaries during the romney campaign. This is a picture on the back of us with -- 
>> this is funny. 
>> -- The obamas. The first time I'd ever met the president. And she said hey, mr. President,'s in my husband, he's the new white house correspondent for nbc. I was like baby, you don't need to -- it's okay, you don't need to do this. And we wrote "just met the neighbors." 
>> It's all good. Next week my interview with nbc's kristen welker about her experience out on the campaign trail following the president. Her dream job as one of nbc's white house correspondents and the one trait she shares with a george clooney character. Got to dune tune in for that.

>>> Politics and film collide. There is fresh controversy behind "zero dark thirty," the film chronicling the manhunt for osama bin laden. The company behind the movie is blasting a member of the motion picture academy. David clenn wrote an op-ed saying the academy should reject the filmor portraying "an easy tolerance of torture." And he goes on to a "i will not be voting for "zero dark thirty" in any academy awards category." Sony pictures responded saying the move is an attempt to censor one of the great films of our time. Well, this week the film was nominated for five oscars including the best picture. It's up for three golden globes tonight. And joining me now chris witherspoon, entertainment editor for the grio.Com. Hey, chris. Talk to me aut what's at play overwhelm. What do you think is behind this? 
>> This film is number one in the country. It is winning in one regards. But the controversy behind the film started a long time ago. It's like politics meets hollywood. There's legations that kathryn bigelow kind of got secret information from the obama administration when she was, you know, beginning the directorial process for the film. And there's these really intense torture scenes. There's sleep deprivation, waterboarding, some things that people, average viewers just might not be able to tolerate and consume and digest that well. So there's just a big controversy, a big buzz around it. And she was, you know, supposedly -- supposed to be nominated for best director for nim but was -- 
>> right. Was she snubbed because of this? Let's think about the kind of films she does. She did "hurt locker." Thumbs up on that. She was hugely acclaimed for that. She does have a golden globe nomination, right? 
>> Yes. 
>> Is that the problem here? Politics at play? 
>> People vague it's politics at play. This film did get a lot of buzz critically. It's number one right now. But because of the controversy a lot of the older academy voters kind of shy away from films that kind of have this kind of controversy around them. People are saying she's snubbed for that very reason. 

[00:48:16]


>> Do you think part of the controversy is because people are saying look at this film and the suggestion is that torture works? 
>> Yeah. People are saying that this film endorses torture and that it does work and it was the reason why we were able to capture osama bin laden. So you know, it's kind of a political taboo. 
>> Let's make a point. That's what people are saying. Sony pictures for their part are saying absolutely not, this does not endorse torture nor make a suggestion -- 
>> and there's ralli right now outside of theaters, people are kind of boycotting the film for that very reason, for the torture scenes. 
>> Let's switch gears, talk about another controversial nominee, that's "django unchained." It did get five nominations. That would include best picture. But not best directoror quentin tarantino. 
>> No. 
>> Spike lee said he doesn't want to see the movie because he says it's going to insult his ancestors. So all the snubs, outrage, what's behind all that? 
>> A lot of the outrage is because of the film kind of using this very intense subject of slavery but also bringing in comedy. You know, there's brutality and then comedy and a romance scene. So spike lee's whole, you know, boycott of the fil was because he felt the film was just kind of not really dealing with slavery in a sensitive manner. However, the film has gotten critical acclaim. It's paced to be one of tarantino's best grossing films at the box office. It was nominated for numerous golden globes. However, the big story with the oscars is tarantino's snub, not getting best director, and then leonardo DiCaprio wasn't nominated for an actor role in had this film as well as jaimie foxx, samuel l. Jackson, kerry washington. Only christoph waltz will get an academy award nomination for this film. 
>> Pull up a chair. We're going to watch the globes tonight. 
>> Cannot wait for that. 
>> Good to sigh. Come see us again. Here's what we've been asking of all you today. Do you think political views should affect oscar nominations? Here are some of your tweets. Ben says "it's the most ridiculous thing to even consider political views for personal achievement and art. What does one have to do with the other." James campbell writes "political views that'll affect the moral character of country are fair game. Torture as an effective tool should not be endorsed." Amanda heisey tweets, "no. If the act mi wants to make the oscars about art and execution it shouldn't matter. It would only discourage the industry." And april pardon responds, "no, they are not nominate ford their tical views but rather for their talents." Thanks for taking your time to share your thoughts with me today.

>>> It's official. 2012 was the hottest year on record for the continental u.S. The national oceanic and atmospheric administration announced that last year -- rather that last year easily beat the previous hottest year. That was 1998. It got the new record. This comes as a new federal report makes it official. Climate change has already started to impact american people and the economy. Well, joining me now is coral davenport, energy and environment correspondent for the national journal. Good to see you again. Just how hot was it last year? 
>> Alex, the average annual temperature in the u.S. Last year was 55.3 degrees. That was about -- that was a degree higher than the last previous record. It was 3.2 degrees higher than the average record -- than the average temperature for the 20th century. Another way to think about the temperatures that we saw last year, between 2011 and 2012 we had 16 months in a row that had higher than normal temperatures. The u.S. Has never seen a stretch like that since the u.S. Government began keeping temperature records in 1895. So that's another way to think about it. It was hot. 
>> There's definite perspective there. But why's it happening? 
>> At this point the evidence is pretty clear. It's happening for two reasons. One is cyclical weather patterns obviously contribute to temperature changes. And the other reason is the increase of fossil fuel emissions in the atmosphere. Scientists say at this point the evidence is clear, compelling, and unequivocal that the increase of pollution from burning coal and oil is trapping heat in our atmosphere and continually leading to an increase in temperatures. 
>> Okay. I'm going to have my director throw up a map here that shows the states that broke records. The red ones are the ones that have the hottest on record. But look at that. Every state was certainly above normal. Is there a jeefrk or environmental reason why certain states broke records and others didn't? 

[00:56:08]


>> You know what, alex? Again, when you look at this map and you see the trend, what's more significant is that you've got 19 stes that broke records and that every state had a higher than average record. This more illustrates that this is a broad trend that we're seeing not just across the united states but across the world. It's a broad trend rather than, you know, small local changes. 
>> Yeah. And we had not only the heat but these extreme weather events. I mean, look at what we had. We had hurricane sandy. Massive droughts, wildfires. So is this the new normal? 
>> Unfortunately, the data are showing that it probably is. The increase of carbo emissions, of fossil fuel pollution, has now warmed the atmosphere to the point that we're seeing reporting saying we are going to see higher sea levels, increased flooding, stronger and more intense storms, stronger and more intense droughts. At this point a lot of these changes -- these results -- these weather changes as a result of changes in the atmosphere, a lot of this is unfortunately already kind of baked in. 
>> Yeah. And coral, the report puts a correlation between that and the economy, its effect on it. How so? 
>> Yeah, this is actually a separate report. We're seeing a lot of reports coming out that all fill in different pieces of this picture. At this point we're seeing impacts on the economy because the drought, for example, contributes to crop -off and spikes in food prices. We're seeing increased costs to taxpayers and to insurance companies from the increase in flooding, from the increase in -- you know, the increase in extreme weather. An interesting example is we saw the level of the mississippi river has gone down in part because of drought. This makes it difficult. You know, this adds difficulty for commerce, for moving goods. So we're starting to see these impacts sort of trickle through and have dollars and cents bottom line impacts on the economy, on taxpayers, on business.

>>> Good day to all of you. Welcome to "weekends with alex witt." It's just a bit past 1:00 a.M. In the east, 10:00 a.M. Out west. We get to what's happening out there. New reaction today. Vice president biden is preparing to hand over his gun safety recommendation to president obama later this week. Former secretary of state colin powell and senator joe manchin both weighing in today. 
>> I'm a gun owner. I'm a believer in the second amendment. I know the amendment rather thoroughly. I know the issue of the well-regulated militia. the constitution and bill of rights to protect our people and with respect to assault rifles I see no need for bush mav in the hands of an individual person who might be deranged. Go out toy range and fire a bushmaster. 
>> You can't push law abiding gun owners away. They have to be at the table. And you need to find out what their preference of protecting that. And what I would say to all of my friends that are nra and gun owners, that there's no way that they're going to take your second amendment rights away. That won't happen. 
>> Let's get right to nbc news white house correspondent peter alexander. With another good day to you, peter. The vice president's going to be reporting his findings to the president tuesday. Do we have an idea what he might be recommending? 

[01:02:55]


>> Well, he sort of telegraphed, alex, some of the proposals or recommendations we should say that he will present to the president, then the president will then put them forward as proposals that he would want to be written up by congress. Among them specifically the idea of universal background checks. Ultimately trying to get rid of among other things the gun show loophole, meaning at gun shows the rules are different than if you buy at a gun store, you've got to get aw background check, if you go to a gun -- if you buy online or you go to a gun show you wouldn't have to do the same thing. That's one of the things they've really focused on. Also trying to restrict those high-capacity magazines. Sometimes they're referred to as clips. But really the magazines that can carry multiple rounds of ammunition that allows someone to fire off a lot of bullets in a very short period of time. And on top of that the one you that heard both colin powell and joe manchin speaking about was this idea, the assault weapons ban. It would be reinstated after expiring in 2004. There has been conversation over the course of this weekend even as far back as maybe thursday or friday that the white house was pulling back from this idea, given the fact that it seemed like there was such stiff opposition in congress and really around the country to that. I reached out to a senior administration official within the last couple of hours and said they were in no way pulling back from the idea of an assault weapons ban. They know it will be tough, but it's still their plan to push ahead with that. 
>> How far do you think the white house is willing to take this fight, peter? 
>> I asked that very question, and they acknowledged those very thoughts. They said it's going to be hard and we have capital that we need to spend on this because there's so many lives at stake around this country, especially given what happened at newtown. Alex, what was interesting is there's? Information from wt's called the freedom group and one of their I think financial statements that they put out back in september, that we've talked a lot about gun sales just soaring in recent weeks, of course, following newtown. The company, the freedom group, the owners of bushmaster, which is the same type of gun that was used in newtown, said that even before newtown they predicted sales would soar because of the continued economic realities, the tough economy, and also the re-election of this president. There are a lot of people across america that have been concerned about a president obama crackdown on guns. And even before newtown they started buying them up in bulk. 

[01:05:04]


>> Okay. Peter alexander, thank you very much from the white house. Joining me now, msnbc contributor and political editor for the grio, perry bacon jr. And reuters political reporter andy sullivan. All right, you guys. So with regard to the guns, first up to you, perry, do you think enough republicans are going to join with democrats that something's going to get done here? 
>> I don't think so. At least right now. You've only seen about two, two out of the 234 house republicans have said they're for some kind of gun control measures right now. So it's hard to see something passing in the house unless president obama can really change public opinion and really galvanize people to the point where house republicans feel like they have to do something. But right now hard to see, i know the white house is thinking about executive orders and that may be the easiest route because then you don't have to have congress approve anything. 
>> Okay. Andy, if something gets passed, is it going to have any teeth to it? 
>> Well, I think like perry said it will be very difficult to get certain provisions. Especially an assault weapons ban. Through the house. But I think president obama also has to be very careful not to alienate a lot of his senate democrats. A lot of these folks represent conservativegun-friendly states, places like north carolina, south dakota, and they could be put in a real tough spot if he goes out and campaigns around the country calling for an assault weapons ban. So you know, they may push for it but they may not get it but even if you don't get the assault weapons ban most killings aren't done with assault weapons. They're done with pistols. Obviously, a handgun ban is off the table, but the background checks might be able to help with that. The notion of background checks and the expanded ammunition clips, limiting the size of those, is a lot more popular in opinion polls than an assault weapon ban. 
>> All right, you guys, we've got to talk about hurricane sandy, the relief rather because we know that coming up on tuesday the 15th the house is going to consider this $50 billion plus bill. The fact is that there are a lot of protests out this weekend. Folks that are affected by sandy are saying look how the government handled katrina and let's compare that to what's happening now with us. Let's listen to some of these protesters. 

[01:07:09]


>> Here we stand, victims of sandy, 75 days later, still waiting. We are suffering. Families are homeless. People are without johns and struggling. 
>> Where the heck is the red tape being cut? Because I sure haven't seen it. My neighbors haven't seen it. My friends haven't seen it. We are still fighting. 
>> Perry, how's this going to play out with the sandy relief bill? Do you think the gop's going to block it? 
>> I do not. I think after chris christie made those very blistering remarks a couple weeks ago about what's taking so long, why is this happening, this money will go through. A lot of house republicans view this kind of funding as some kind of stimulus money and this money as being wasted but that's not a majority view at this point, in part because they realize this is politically untenable to have that view. 
>> Andy, do you think the bill gets passed this week? 
>> I'm not sure. The republican stance has been lately that they have to find offsetting cuts, that they can't worsen the deficit by just passing this stuff on top of it. So we'll see how they finesse that. 
>> Okay. Perry, let's take a listen to colin powell, who was on "meet the press," reflecting on the gop and race. 
>> There's also a dark -- a dark vein of intolerance in some parts of the party. What do I mean by that? What I mean by that is they still sort of look down on minorities. How can I evidence that? When I see a former governor say that the president is shucking and jiving, that's a racial-era slave term. When I see another former governor after the president's first debate where he didn't do very well says that the president was lazy. He didn't say he was slow, he was tired, he didn't do well. He said he was lazy. Now, it may not mean anything to most americans, but to those of us who are african-americans, the second word is shiftless and then there's a third word that goes along with it. Birther. The whole birther movement. Why do senior republican leaders tolerate this kind of discussion within the party? I think the party has to take a look at itself. 

[01:09:14]


>> So perry, this is really powerful stuff coming from colin powell. I mean, he's addressing this stuff straight on. Were you surprised by this? 
>> I was surprised with the bluntness of it. He all but accused some senior republican leaders about not caring about very racist comments. And so I was surprised by the bluntness of it. Colin powell endorsed obama in '08 and at this point he's the republican -- I think now he's pretty close to the democratic party in terms of views. That said, some of the things he said are not surprising. I mean, republicans are very concerned right now about how much they are losing the black, hispanic, and even asian american vote, and they are taking steps and I think you will see them take more steps to seem like more of a tolerant party. 
>> Andy, you've got colin powell there calling out the republicans saying you've got to re-examine yourselves. Do you think they're going to heed that call? 
>> Yeah. I think republicans have been talking a lot about this themselves. I think they realized in this particular election cycle that they wer't going to win much of the black vote just because it was president obama on the ballot. But there's been an internal discussion they have to do more to appeal to hispanics and blacks and women and other people who the democratic party are sort of capturing at this point. 
>> All right, andy sullivan. Perry bacon jr., Always good to see you both. Thanks, guys. 
>> Thanks, alex. 
>>> A dress rehearsal for the presidential inauguration ceremonies held this morning. A practice run of the military participation for the event. That includes the musical units the marching bands and the color guards. It also includes the inaugural parade along pennsylvania avenue and the swearing in ceremony with official party stand-ins. 
>>> And a "new york times" report says president obama's inaugural committee is $10 million short of its $50 million fund-raising goal. The inaugural officials call the figure outdated and aides to the president say they believe they're still on track to make their budget. Be sure to watch msnbc for complete coverage of the inauguration beginning next sunday. I'll be reporting live from the nation's capital on the president's official swearing in this time next week.

>>> Disappointing rare coin collectors everywhere, the u.S. Treasury department has announced it is not going to mint a trillion-dollar platinum coin as part of a proposal to avoid the debt ceiling debate. The unorthodox idea to say the least, it was possible due to a legal loophole that allows the u.S. Mint to create coins of any denomination. 
>>> There was a time the state of california could have really used a trillion-dollar coin, but not this year. Governor jerry brown delivered his state budget proposal on thursday, and for the first time in six years it does not have a deficit. Joining me now is jared bernstein, former chief economist for vice president biden and a senior fellow at the center on budget and policy priorities and a good friend to us here. It's good to see you. 
>> Good to see you, alex. Thanks for inviting me. 
>> Listen, your reaction to this budget. Now, is it all good news? 
>> I think it's mostly good news. The way they got there is precisely the way I think a functional political system would deliver a budget that kind of balances out like this. That is, they did it through some real spending cuts but also some tax increases. And that's the kind of balance that certainly the president has been seeking and that folks here in washington have of course been squabbling about. The tax increases were largely on folks at the very high end of the scale, but they also gave a bit of a bump up to their sales taxes, and the spending cuts were not trivial and they hit lots of programs that people care about, in health care, in welfare. And I think there's a debate to see how much those cuts stick as we go forward. But I like the look of the deal in terms of its balance. 
>> Well, the way this all happened was through this prop 30 that passed. So is this the kind of thing that federal leaders, should they have agreed on reforms and cuts like this? 
>> I think they should. And I think what this deal really kind ever thematically gets to, I think it gets to the heart of the questions you're asking here, alex, is here you have a governor that goes to the people of the state of california and says, I know you care a lot about education, i know you say you want us to have a flagship university system, a public school system that helps balance out some of the inequities in our economy, but you know, we're actually going to have to pay for it, these things don't come just because we want them. And I think one of the difficulties with having it on the federal stage when we talk about our budget is that people want a lot of things but they don't want to pay for them and politicians go forth and say oh, yeah, you can have a lot of things, don't worry about paying for them. Jerry brown really kind of broke that mold by going to the folks, going to the people and saying how do we want our government to work? What do we want it to do? And if we want x we're going to have pay for x. 

[01:17:38]


>> But why is it different? I d't get why it's different, why it should be different because california is a state, you don't just look at it as being a state compared to the federal government because it's got a huge gdp. How is it that things will pass with the governor talking to the citizens and saying here's what we want to do? Why can't that work in terms of tactically on a federal level? 
>> Well, it's a great question. And by the way, their gdp is about the size of canada's. Their budget amounts to about 100 billion. So you're right, we're talking about numbers that are comparable to those of significant countries. I think the answer to your question has to do with a couple of things. First of all, the level of partisan rancor, while it's been very high and dysfunctional in california in the recent past, is nothing compared to what we've got going on here in washington. I mean, if you think about the fiscal cliff and the debt ceiling, in my view these aren't just, you know, kind of interesting things that we can debate on our television show. This is political malpractice. These are self-inflicted wounds on an economy that should be going forward. The idea that our leaders don't come forth and have the kind of conversation that jerry brown has had. And I think he's a gifted leader in that regard. In that sense this really does kind of point the way forward. 
>> Now, you alluded to this in terms of looking down the road but the "sacramento bee" quoted one expert who said it is too soon to draw any conclusions and that budget estimates, estimates are often wildly off. So is there truth to that? Could this actually when playing out not look as good down the road? 
>> Of course it could. And I read that quote, my first thought was that's a critique you could level at any budget at any state or any federal government or any country. Basically, these budget agreements are agreements that a legislature makes at a point in time. Next year's leng slach could come back and change that. I think the case of california you have to look at two things. One is that some of these revenues come from -- a non-trivial amount of theechblz v revenues come from the folks at the very high end of the income scale. If they stop going as well that's could be a constraint. And of course the spending cuts have to hold. We have a legislature there that's 2/3 democrat. They've already been making some noise about taking back some of those cuts. So it's definitely worth watching, but any budgetary accomplishment can be reversed by later legislators. 

[01:19:52]


>> Okay. Jared bernstein, thank you so much as always. 
>> Thank you, alex. 
>>> The union will not be divided. That is the takeaway from the white house's response to petitions signed by over 350,000 american citizens asking for the right for their states to secede from the u.S. In its response the white house said, "free and open debate is what makes this country work and many people around the world risk their lives every day for the liberties we often take for granted.

>>> We're approaching half past the hour. Welcome back, everyone, to "weekends with alex witt." The battle over presidential cabinet nominations drawing an interesting response from SENATOR john McCain of arizona. When asked why there's been such republican resistance to nominees like chuck hagel, the arizona lawmaker seemed to suggest it was because the president didn't seek the gop's approval in advance. 
>> It's usually been the rule, if the president's going to be in charge of the government we have to give him the people he wants to run it. But republicans seem to be against every single person that he has nominated. Can you be for senator hagel? I mean, in some ways he was the chairman of your -- co-chair of your campaign in 2000. He would seem to be your kind of guy. A veteran. A guy who's been shot at -- 
>> he's a veteran. He's a friend.

>> Good to be here. 
>> Can you correlate the increase in drone attacks to a withdrawal of basically the manpower, the troops on the ground? 
>> If you had to look at the numbers, the short answer is no. Since president obama came into office there have been close to 300 strikes in various countries as a result of these drone strikes. So the indication is or the data suggests that in fact this was prior to any announcement or potential announcement of a u.S. Withdrawal from afghanistan. So the u.S. Has increased this type of operation. There's no doubt that with the reduction of troops in afghanistan the u.S. Will resort to more and more either covert operations or more aerial strikes. But for the time being it doesn't appear to be a shift in policy or change in policy because we've seen already over the past four years what the obama administration's been doing with these air strikes. 

[01:32:05]


>> Aerial drone strikes aside, does the cia need to pull out at the same time as the military? Because doesn't the military help back up many of their operations? 
>> Without a doubt. But the cia already maintains such a strong presence across the region it's unlikely that it's going to reduce that. There's some aspect of the cia's presence that's involved with helping the military, perhaps gathering intelligence precisely for operations that involve troops, but also that's going to shift perhaps to providing intelligence for these types of drones. A lot of that relies on human intelligence on the ground and assets on the ground. It's unlikely that is going to be reduced if the u.S. Still feels it needs to have that presence as they've indicated they will. 
>> Does the cia operate in its own kind of bubble? Are they going to be able to as effectively bring this human intelligence with less people on the ground? 
>> Well, from a technological point of view, phone intercepts, satellite imagery, all of that will probably stay if not increase because of the fact it will rely on it more. But there's no doubt the cia maintains a robust network of human intelligence on the ground in various pts of pakistan and afghanistan. But the cia provides the military and the military provides the cia with a lot of intelligence. They share that. But there's no doubt that the cia runs a lot of the networks or maintains a lot of the networks in these parts of the world that provide the operational intelligence that feeds into the military and sometimes not the other way around. 
>> A perspective how effective drones are as a weapon. 
>> You know, that's a very interesting question. From the americans' perspective, at least certainly from the obama administration's they'll argue it's effective. But a lot of people are raising questions from the ethics, the legality of it. It creates a sense of resentment where the strikes happen. International experts have expressed questions whether the united states can continue these air strikes in this environment especially with al qaeda being decimate with so many assessments. There's a raging debate outside the united states that I don't think most americans are aware about as to the legality and the ethics of this time of attack and the toll that it's taking. It may have a short-term strategic objective but in the long run a lot of people are questioning whether or not it's going to breed more problems for the united states in the years ahead.

>> Ayman molyehedin, thank you. Investors should be on the lookout for the beginning of the earnings seasons with banks and financial companies reporting their bottom line results. Retail sale figures come out on tuesday as does the monthly report on wholesale prices followed by the consumer prices index on wednesday. Then on thursday the census bureau reports on housing starts and building permits for the month of december. 
>>> A new report says up to half of the food produced in the world is wasted. It is never consumed. That's the finding from the british institution of mechanical engineers. And joining me now jopth bloom, author of "american 
wasteland: How americans throw away nearly half of its food and what we can do about it." Jonathan, welcome to you. This is something we all should be interested in talking about because let's look at what this report sa, that the world creates 4.4 billion tons of food every year and yet only 30% to 50% of it is actually eaten. So where is it going? 
>> Well, the vast majority of it is actually going to the landfill. But where it isn't going is to feed individuals and families. And so these days as many of us are trying to figure out how to put food on our family's plates, feed our families, to have this amount of our resources and food being squandered to me is just morally callous. 
>> Morally callous. It seems criminal. I'll tell you. The waste here. How much is it from the producing end versus the consumer end? 
>> Well, the funny thing is there isn't an all-encompassing study looking at where food waste is happening at all levels of the food chain. Butrom anecal evidence the majority of waste happens on the farm level where food never actually leaves the farm, and then in our own homes, where consumers are not using about 1/4 of the food that we bring home. 
>> Is that because westerners, they want -- they demand like eastically perfect food, you get a apple that as a little mark on it you don't want to 'that. Or an overly strict expiration date mentality. Are those things we can turn the tide on? 

[01:36:21]


>> Oh, I believe we really can. And you're right. Those are large factors on why we as consumers are wasting so much. Appearance in our food often trumps taste. So if something isn't the right shape, size, or color or if, like you mentioned, it has a little bruise in it, then those food items will be cast aside somewhere throughout the food chain. And unfortunately, that definitely adds up. And with expiration dates those are not necessarily speaking to a food's safy but about its quality. So if folks at home are treating that as the drop dead date on when food should be thrown out, then you're going to be throwing away a lot of good food. 
>> So what can we do about it? And is there a way to direct this wasted food to regions where people are starving? 
>> Well, redistribution of food can get a little bit tricky when you talk about internationally, but let's look right here in the u.S. About 15% of americans are coming from food-insecure homes. So they're not quite sure where their next meal is coming from at any given point. So when we have this glut, this excess of food, particularly at the retail level, and restaurants as well, there are many food recovery organizations that do a nice job of going out there and capturing these edible but unsellable foods. But we as individuals have a role to play here, too. In our own homes, if we are aware, just simply being aware of how much food we're not using, then we're going to do a better job. But thinking about that earlier stat I mentioned-b 1/4 of the food we bring home we don't use. So with that in mind let's just be a bit smarter in how we shop for our food. 
>> You know the irony here, we waste all this food and yet the u.S. Still has this major obesity problem. Are the two mutually exclusive? 
>> Well, the link there is that our food system is broken. To have so much hunger, so much obesity, and then be wasting about 40% of our food, it shows that there's a major disconnect. We aren't connected to where our food comes, from and we just blindly trusted food companies, and that's got us into trouble. But the real common link between waste and obesity is in the portion sizes that many of us see at restaurants, and even it's trickling into our own homes. The idea of what a sensible amount of food to serve people is. And so we overserve our friends and family and we certainly get overserved at restaurants. And as a result we are wasting and getting obese. 

[01:38:58]


>> Is that a uniquely american problem, the portion control size? 
>> Unfortunately, we have created these massive portions, but we're kind of exporting the idea to other developed nations. The rest of the world is catching up with us in terms of the amount of food they are wasting. But there is a largevide when you look at the amount of food in the developing world versus developed. There's this question of loss versus waste. But we in america unfortunately are leading the way, so to speak, in wasting food. 
>> Not in a good way. We don't want to be leading that way. Jonathan bloom, author of "american wasteland," thank you very much for joining us. 
>> Thanks for having me.

>>> It's time for the big three. And today's topics, gop and race, the wrong fights, and this week's must-reads. Let's bring in the big three panel. Nia malika henderson. Republican strategist joe watkins. And president of hataway communications and former senior adviser to the hillary clinton and al gore presidential campaigns, doug hataway. Hello to the threeyou. Joe, we had secretary of state colin powell on "meet the press" who gave his assessment of the current state of the republican party and race. Let's all take a listen to this. 
>> There's also a dark -- a dark vein of intolerance in some parts of the party. What do I mean by that? What iean by that is they still sort of look down on minorities. How can I evidence that? When I see a former governor say that the president is shucking and jiving. That's a racial-era slave term. When I see another former governor after the president's first debate where he didn't do very well says that the president was lazy. He didn't say he was slow, he was tired, he didn't do well. He said he was lazy. Now, it may not mean anything to most americans. But to those of us who are african-americans, the second word is shiftless, and then there's a third word that goes along with it. Birther. The whole birther movement. Why do senior republican leaders tolerate this kind of discussion within the party? I think the party has to take a look at itself. 

[01:44:30]


>> So what's your reaction to that, joe? 
>> My reaction is that general powell is absolutely right. He's right on target. The republican party has to be very, very thoughtful, especially if it wants to be a winning party in the next presidential cycle, to not talk about the sitting president of the united states in terms that are anything less than respectful. Even if you disagree with the president on policy matters, to talk about him in dismissive terms or in anything that might sound demeaning is not acceptable and not smart. The party has to be more open to people -- you can have an opinion about something. You can have a belief system as I do -- I'm a pastor of a church. I have a strong belief system. And at the same time not be intolerant of people who don't see it the way you do. The only way the republican party wins in 2016 is to include latinos and african-americans and women in much larger numbers than they currently have. 
>> But joe, there are these elements in the party. How do you explain that? 
>> Well, I think that the result of the last election has done a great deal to open the eyes of anybody whose eyes may still be closed about what happens if you don't include more than just what republicans have right now as part of the party base. You've got to include people who aren't presently part of the base. There were so many people who may voted for president obama in the last cycle who may not have been happy with everything that he did but the republicans did not give other people a reason, enough of a reason, those groups, be it women or latinos or african-americans, aw reason to vote for their candidate. And that's got to change. So the language has to change. The level of tolerance to people who don't see things the way maybe you do or I do has to change. Certainly you have to include people who don't look like us. 
>> But nia-malika, isn't it even more about including in the party, it's about reflecting social and cultural acceptance. 
>> That's right. If you look at this congress, it's the most diverse congress in history and reflects where this country is. Increasingly diverse. Increasingly this congress representative of these diverse voices. Whether it be asians, african-americans, women, gay people. And so that's where the republican party needs to go. What makes I think colin powell's comment so effective is he doesn't often speak about race. In 2008 he did endorse president obama and he dressed at that point what were these rumors about then candidate obama's faith. These rumors that he was muslim. And he in a very powerful statement, he said he isn't muslim, he's in fact a christian, but what if he were? It wouldn't matter. We're a pluralistic society that believes in tolerance. And I think that's why it was so effective, those comments that he made this morning. I think they're going to reverberate in the party. And you do have in the republican party people having these conversations already. They very much looked at this last election and see it as a referendum on their party and this underpinning issue around diversity and expanding the party. 

[01:47:37]


>> You're a democrat, doug. I want you to weigh in on these comments from that perspective. Whether there's a political calculation or ju assessment. 
>> Well, political calculation or -- I agree with everything that's been said but let's be clear this isn't just some isolated element within the party. This has been part of their political strategy to build a base largely among conservative whites in this country with a political of division, in groups and out groups. It goes beyond race. Whether it's looking down on people who are different in whatever way, gays or recent immigrants or whatever it is. That's been how -- that's how they've done business. And that's the politics of the past. Americans are over it. Most of them. And I agree that this is really a time to, whether it's political calculation or really just taking a fundamental look at what do you really believe here, that this country should be like. It's critical to whether they're just going to become relegated to a fringe element and be left behind or really be a legitimate force in american politics moving forward. It's a huge issue for them. 
>> Bottom line, joe, do you think the gop has learned a lesson from this last election that will prevent extremists on the right from holding the rest of the gop party hostage? 
>> Well, clearly, this makes two elections, two presidential elections in a row that republicans have not won and have not won significantly. And if that -- if the republicans want to change that, if in 2016 republicans want to have a chance to win the white house and have a majority in the senate as well as in the house, they're going to have to do some thgs differently. So I think they've heard, whether or not the party learns will be seen by how we perform in the next four years. 
>> All right, guys, we're going to switch gears and talk about debt ceiling. Oh, joy. Nia-malika, let's talk about how the president is framing the debt ceiling debate. 
>> One thing I will not compromise over is whether or not congress should pay the tab for a bill they've already racked up. If congress refuses to give the united states the ability to pay its bills on time, the consequences for the entire global economy could be catastrophic. 

[01:49:38]


>> Okay. So republicans say they want spending cuts. And some are even suggesting that partial government shutdown tactic, that's what's going to be necessary here. There are also some in the gop who are just not happy about all the pork being put into things like the sandy relief bill. That unof course set to go to the house floor on tuesday. Nia-malika, do the republicans risk the -- run the risk, rather, ofeing viewed as completely obstructionist? Are they picking the wrong fights? I mean, let's take let's take sandy for example. 
>> They certainly got a lot of blowback from new yorkers and folks in new jersey around their standing in the way of that sandy relief bill. They ended up passing it in bits and pieces and they will look to do that next week. They do run the risk of being a party that just says no. There is discussion within the republican party about where they want to go. They talk about being a party of ideas. If that is the way the party wants to go, if it comes to spending cuts and that is where they want the discussion to be they have to be more specific about what types of spending cuts they want to make. Is it to social security or medicare? They have to make an argument rather than saying no. Their approval rating is pretty low. Gallop poll showed more people identified themselves as democrats instead of republicans. 
>> What do republicans have to use in these fights? 
>> You have a majority, of course, in the house. We do not have a majority of votes in the senate. There will be challenges there. I think she makes a great point which is it is how you are seen. Republicans have to be careful they are not being viewed as the party of no. Republicans do want to talkt about getting spending under control and the discussion about how they do that will be important going forward. 
>> Democrats and leverage, what do they have? 

[01:51:41]


>> I think they have the upper hand politicly. People are really seeing the congressional republicans as the standing in the way of any sort of compromise for the good of the country here and the president has the message right. It is about paying the bills we have incurred. We cannot default on the debt of the united states.

>> We have a great piece in the washington post about the evolution of the nra from a small group to what is now one of the most powerful lobbiest organizations on the hill. What this piece details is the history of the nra, the pivotal role they played in the 2000 campaign denying al gore of this and suggests the nra is strengthened when they are under pressure. You have seen they have apparently expanded their membership. So this is going to be a real fight on this debate around gun control and this idea that somehow obama might be able to make a run around the nra as he pushes for increased gun legislation. This makes it look like it is going to be really hard to do. 
>> I think, doug, in the category of great minds thinking alike, didn't you pick the same one for the same reasons? Anything to add to that? 
>> A double must read. When I was a kid going to camp the nra gave you your little prize for being a safe shooter. Now it is a rich, powerful lobby. It is interesting to look at how the use of extremism or lack of compromise really dialing up controversy as a tactic for creating a really powerful constituency.

What does it take to get your hair this shiny, bouncy, strong, and beautiful? The wen healthy hair care system by chaz dean. 
>> People ask me all the time: Does wen cleansing conditioner really work? I started using wen two years ago. So...You tell me. Does wen really work? Since I first started using wen. My hair's so much healthier now, it's so much smoother, it's so much silkier, and it all starts with wen. 
>> With wen, it's just like this "kumbaya" product that everybody can use. 
>> I will never go back to shampoo. Never, never, never. I'm a wen girl, so I'm gonna be using that forever. 
>> Are you still using that old, ordinary shampoo? Do you still think the more suds and the more squeaky-clean your hair, the better? I know. I used to think that, too. But what it really means is that you're probably using a shampoo with lots of detergents and sulfates that may be stripping your hair of natural oils, color, and shine. Well, today, we're gonna try and change that. Wen is not an ordinary shampoo. It's a unique cleansing conditioner designed to replace shampoo, conditioner, deep conditioner, detangler, leave-in condititioner. Five products in one. And it won't strip your hair like regular shampoo can. In fact, wen is formulated to help transform your hair into smoother, softer, shinier, stronger, more beautiful hair the very first time you use it. And today, we'll show you how wen can transform your hair after just one use with some amazing makeovers you have to see to believe. 

[00:02:20]


>> My hair only looks like this 'cause of wen. I never had beautiful hair until I started using wen. 
>> Every once in a while, I'll walk by a mirror and I'll think, "is that my hair?" It's long, and silky, and shiny, and it's the hair I always wanted. 
>> Wen was created by hollywood colorist and hairstylist chaz dean, and has been the secret of his celebrity clients for over 10 years. Now, wen is the fastest-growing hair care line in america, revolutionizing the way millions of people all around the world are cleansing their hair, transforming it after just one use. That's why chaz is quickly becoming america's hair guru. You've seen chaz and his award-winning wen products featured in prestigious magazines and television shows, and on today's show, you'll meet chaz and hear about his mission to change the world one head at a time, with wen. Wen is proven to increase hair strength and manageability up to 70 percent after just one use. That's a difference you can see and feel the very first time you use it. And wen is clinically proven to significantly retain color so it lasts longer, which can save you even more money on hair color. Coming up, you'll see what your favorite celebrities are saying about wen, and what happened when chaz brought wen to the miss america pageant, and turned pageant girls into wen girls. Right now is the best time ever to give up your ordinary shampoo and try wen, because this is our best deal ever, with chaz's exciting new products, and an offer you won't find anywhere else. So keep watching to find out how you can be a wen girl. 
>> I'm sitting here with my friend chaz dean. Chaz, so, I've been using wen for two years, right? And I just wanna say thank you, right off the bat-- 
>> you're welcome. 
>> --I just wanna thank you for my hair, because it was not like this before I started using wen. And, you know, being in the industry, they would fry my hair with, you know, with bad product, and using horrible irons. And it got so bad that I actually had to cut my hair off. 

[00:04:22]


>> I remember that. 
>> Yeah. 
>> And people think you're doin' it--they probably think you're doin' it for the style, but they don't realize you're doing it 'cauf all the damage. 
>> Exactly. 
>> And it's funny you say that, because I look back at all the celebrities that are out there on hit shows right now, and, if you watch your shows, and watch the girls with the hair is getting longer and healthier and shinier, those are the wen girls. The girls that are on the shows that their hair is getting shorter and shorter and shorter, because of the damage, they haven't discovered wen yet. 
>> Right. 
>> So if I can fix the hair that goes through all that damage on a daily basis, everyone at home, you know, the everyday woman-- it's a no-brainer to have beautiful, healthy, shiny hair. 
>> But people can't imagine giving up the lather. So, can you tell us again why lathering shampoos are bad for your hair? 
>> I mean, from birth, you're taught lather, lather, lather! The more lather, the cleaner! 
>> Squeaky clean! 
>> Squeaky clean. But to me, if you're using anything that's lathering, it's gonna strip your hair of its natural essential oils, sheen, luster, moisture, shine, not to even mention your color. So with wen, what I've done is I've eliminated all the harsh chemicals, so you're cleansing the scalp and hydrating the hair at the same time, without stripping it. What it does do is add sheen, luster, moisture, shine, color retention-- 
>> body. 
>> --Strengthens, body, volume. It does all the things you want hair to do. You're nourishing your hair every time you cleanse your hair with the cleansing conditioners. 
>> I'm thrilled with my hair. It's healthy, and I feel like it's just as thick, if not better than it was, in my twenties. 
>> After the first time that I used wen hair care products, I noticed such a difference that I had to take a picture that very day of my hair. Since then, it just continues to get better and better. 
>> Wen's enough to give me that shine and that dimension that I've always wanted, so it's done that. Frizz is gone, that's never a problem anymore. And it's just soft and healthy and shiny, and when you touch it, it just, it feels different. It feels, just healthy and softer. My name is marisa, and I'm a wen girl.

>> My hair gets totally abused working in television. I wear it long, I wear it short, I wear it dark, I wear it light. I tried wen, I actually had a whole head of extensions, 'cause I had just wrapped my "dancing with the stars" season, so what surprised me the most was how silky it was and how easy it was for me to run a comb through my hair, because the tricky thing about extensions is, extensions are real hair. So I have to treat them just like I treat my natural hair, but I actually baby them even more, because they need a little bit more moisture, they need silky products, and I think the wen system is the answer to that. I've seen a lot of changes since I first started using wen. My hair is so much healthier now, it's so much smoother, it's so much silkier. So, basically, the bottom line is hair that looks like this is attainable for anyone and everyone. It's affordable, it's a great system, it's really easy, super user-friendly, and it all starts with wen. Look washed out? That's because you actually can be washing it out with your shampoo. Keep your color vibrant longer with wen. It's clinically proven to retain color better than a leading shampoo on the market, and that means wen can save you money on hair color. 
>> So we went to chaz's salon and put wen to the test, and this, you've got to see to believe. 
>> So we colored ann today, and we colored ellen today, the exact same color. Danny is gonna cleanse ann's hair with a leading traditional shampoo on the market that lathers, and anna is gonna be using wen on ellen. Watch what happens today, right before your eyes, and every time you lather up at home, this is what's happening to you, if you're using traditional shampoos. I did this comparison. The color ran everywhere. This time, I wanted to take it a step further, so I cleansed both girls 10 times in a row to see the difference. We cleansed ann 10 times with ordinary shampoo. We cleansed ellen 10 times with wen. So whose hair would you rather have--ann's, who lathered up and is now dry, frizzy, flyaway, color fading, or would you rather have ellen's, whose color is rich, vibrant, beautiful, healthy, shiny, manageable, bouncy? It's your choice, and it's really simple. Say goodbye to the lather and hello to wen. 

[00:08:56]


>> After 10 times using ordinary shampoo, I went from red to brown. 
>> And I stayed red-- 
>> ha-ha-ha! 
>> After 10 times of using wen. 
>> And I can't wait to go back to being a wen girl forever. 
>> And ever. 
>> Ever. Never again, shampoo. 
>> Wen has given me wonderful hair days. I mean, I just love the way it feels, the vibrancy of it, the color...I mean, the color really stays with wen. 
>> Since using wen, my highlights and my lowlights have just come out so much more, and just become so vibrant, and they just pop out. 
>> I've had men stop me in the street and tell me, "what do you use?" And I tell them, "wen," and they always say, "i gotta buy my wife that," ha-ha-ha! 
>> You don't really know what your shampoo is doing to your hair because you don't just use regular shampoo. You use shampoo, conditioner, leave-in conditioner, maybe a straightener or a curl enhancer, some mousse for volume, styling gel, hairspray, not to mention curling and flat irons-- all of these other products to make your hair look good ter the shampoo. But with wen, you don't need all that. All you need is wen, and your hair will look sexy, healthier, shinier, and fuller, without all the other products.

>> Women all across america are making the switch, and can proudly call themselves wen girls. And wen is for everyone. Once you see what it can do for your hair, you'll be a wen girl just like me, and you'll never use ordinary shampoo again. 
>> I'm tammy, and I'm a wen girl. 
>> I'm brielle, and I'm a wen girl. 
>> I'm sarah, and I'm a wen girl. 
>> I'm holly robinson peete, and I'm a wen girl. 
>> From her starring roles in "21 jump street" to "mike and molly,"?? veteran actress holly robinson peete has had many different looks and hairstyles over the years, but she relies on wen to keep her hair looking its best. 
>> I used to get my hair relaxed, years ago. I stopped about 15 or 20 years ago, because I wanted to have more of a natural look. I ted what it was doing to my hair, processing it and drying it out. And so, wen was the perfect companion for my natural hair. I can go with ease from curly hair to straight hair. I don't have to use a lot of heat, and that's because my hair is so healthy and so hydrated from using wen. Chaz understands that everybody's hair is different. He made a product that is so amazing because it covers the rainbow, not just caucasian hair-- african-american hair, asian hair... It's just like this "kumbaya" product that everybody can use. I use wen on my entire family. I have four children with four different textures of hair. And all four of them use wen, love wen. People tweet me all the time after they see the wen infomercial about, "i'm goin' natural, is wen a good product for my natural hair?" And I'm, like, "it is the only product for your natural hair." No matter what ethnicity you are, wen works. But wen for two years now. But just to show you the difference wen can make in your hair, I'm gonna show you the difference wen makes in mine. I can't stand to wash my hair with regular shampoo anymore, but I did it, just so you can see the difference in my hair, just one time after ordinary shampoo, and then one time after wen. 

[00:17:26]


>> Can we wen you now? 
>> Please! 
>> One time with shampoo took out a lot of that moisture, a lot of that shine and the bounce, and the body, but we're bringing that back to you right now. One is, "do you really use wen?" And when I say "yes," they say, "does it really work?" 
>> Having you here clearly means, "yes, it works"-- 
>> it works. 
>> --And yes, it does clean your hair. I can see the difference in your hair now from when you came in with it shampooed. It was--it was frizzier. You're back! 
>> Yay! 
>> Alyssa's back! For two years now, and my hair looks fabulous. It looks better than it did when I was in my teens and twenties. 
>> My hair was fried. I had used a lot of dyes and bleaches on it, and it was a disaster. Wen has acly completely helped me with that. My hair's growing now, and it just feels so much more healthy, and it's stronger. 
>> Every morning, I wake up and I go to do my hair, I'm like, "who put that there? Whose hair is that? It's not mine." Like, every morning, I still can't believe this is my hair. 
>> Hi, I'm linda, and I'm a wen girl. 
>> My name is anna, and I'm a wen girl. 
>> I'm nicole, and I'm a wen girl. 
>> I'm roselyn sanchez, and I'm a wen girl. 
>> Roselyn sanchez is an award-winning star of tv and films, and her gorgeous hair kept her on countless lists of beautiful women in hollywood. 
>> I was blessed to find wen, and it's been incredible. You know, you use it the first time, you go, "this is really interesting, it's different, 'cause I'm not used to this." You use it a second time and you go, "oh my god, I'm liking it." Third time, "i love it." Fourth time, you go, "my hair looks amazing." And people around you go, "what are you doing? What are you doing to your hair?" I'm telling you, I'm gonna keep usin' it. I have my husband usin' it, I have friends usin' it, I have makeup artists usin' it, because it is just good. And when you know that something is good for you, you just, you know, spread the love. I'm a wen girl, so I'm gonna be using that forever. By women all across america, it's used by women at the miss america pageant. Now, you can imagine how tough pageant life is on your hair. All the styling, teasing, blow-drying, hot flat irons and curling irons, all day long, all under hot lights. But here's what happened when chaz introduced wen to the miss america contestants in las vegas to show them a new way to take care of their hair. 

[00:20:12]

Wait till we're done with you. Okay? One time with wen. 
>> All right! 
>> I see some hair that I can't wait to see the after! And it absolutely transformed my hair. I mean, it went from dull and lifeless to full of body and soft. I feel like a bombshell. 
>> You're gonna have much more hydrated hair, so you're not gonna have to fight so much to get the bounce, the body, the shine, all those things miss texas wants. 
>> That's right! 
>> I wear extensions, and they always cause me so many problems, but I tried the wen product for the first time today, and they took all the tangles out of them, they feel healthy and shiny, and they look wonderful. 
>> You'll probably tell me you have frizzy hair. It's--you don't have frizzy hair, it's what you've been doing to your hair that's causing the frizz. Think of your hair as an extension of your skin, and I guarantee you'll treat it much nicer. 
>> Thanks to chaz, my hair is so full of volume, and so full of moisture. It's softer than my hair has ever been, I've never felt anything this soft. 
>> I can't believe I have this much volume and this much body. Thank you so much, chaz dean. You've made my hair feel wonderful, you've made me feel wonderful, and we can't thank you enough to have you as a miss america sponsor. 
>> And with just one use with wen, you, too, at home can feel like miss america.

>> I'm miss wisconsin, and I'm a wen girl. 
>> Your miss america 2012 is... Miss wisconsin! 

[00:22:17]


>> Using wen the week of the miss america pageant was, truthfully, a life-saver on my hair, because it gave me that extra confidence of feeling, like, my hair looked beautiful, onstage or off-stage. Wen is an incredible system. It's so easy, it's so fast, it's so convenient.

But I had an older brother who was also a musician, who's since passed away, but he played tenor saxophone. And he had around the house a lot of 78 records, a lot of bebop records - Charlie Parker, Fats Navarro, Dizzy Gillespie. So I used to really listen to this music, and by the time I was 13 or 14, I was trying to play and actually had my first gig when I was 14. And the same band my brother was playing in, you know so these were all old guys, they were in 

[00:27:07]


their 30s [laughs] you know, so I was 14. But for me it was a great experience, and that kind of got me really into the music. But in terms of Jazz - nobody taught me that. I mean that's from listening, and observing, trying to imitate, you know, so that's - it's very difficult to really study Jazz, you know. A big part of it is just listening and observing.

Ramberg, and welcome to "your business," the show dedicated to giving you tips and advice to help your small business grow. For small businesses, the uncertainty of last year has carried over into 2013. The good news. The national federation of independent business optimism index was up slightly in december. The bad news. The index is still at recession levels. The index for this month is expected to be impacted by the fiscal cliff tax deal passed by congress. That deal negotiated between vice president joe biden and senate republicans ends the payroll tax holiday, raises taxes on those making over $400,000 a year and increases capital gains tax rates. So, how will this impact your small business? Barbara wealthman is an attorney and a leading authority on tax law and finance for small businesses. She is the writer of the muntari e newsletter "big ideas for small business" and also author of the book "j.J. Lasser's "1,001 tax deductions and great to see both of you. Thanks for joining us. 

[00:02:20]


>> A pleasure. 
>> I read some article that said recently frustrated, elated, happy, confused, those are people's reactions right now to just what happened in washington. Barb, I want to talk with you first and foremost about the payroll tax holiday so there's no uncertainty about that. Your employees are going to be paying more out of their payroll. For their payroll tax is this something you've discussed with your employes? 
>> We haven't discussed with them yet. I think we were waiting first to see what was going to happen. Our plan is to discuss with them right before they receive their first paychecks that there is going to be a change, that there is a 2% additional tax that is coming out of their pay and we're going to, you know, try to work with them if there's going to be any type of problems. 
>> Yeah. This is a question that I just had myself is do you talk about this, barbara, or do you just assume that everybody knows because chances are people are going to get their first paycheck and think why am i getting less money? 
>> I think if they haven't been paying attention to what's happening in the news they may be vurprised, but they may well be aware of that change. What they have to know is they don't have to do anything. There's nothing required of employees because of the new law. However, some employees may want TO FILE NEW W-4s WITH THEIR Employers to change their withholding. 
>> Right. 
>> That's something you can bring up with them. 
>> You can bring it up with them. 
>> So some issues have been resolved and many issues are still unresolved. We still have this enormous debt, and how worried are you, barbara, for small businesses going forward that taxes may go up, taxes we haven't even discussed right now, that their expenses may go up sometime in 2013. 
>> Well, anything is possible and all possibilities really are on the table. Clearly they could come back and attack various tax breaks or so-called loopholes that are there, but we really don't know. It's likely that nothing will be changed for 2013 and that any changes will take effect the following year, so at least we do have some luxury to plan for this year and budget for this year. 

[00:04:34]


>> And that's the thing. Small businesses actually would say got off easy in this deal, some of the expensing, depreciation, the bonus depreciation, the r & d credit that viewers may be using, those all stay but only through 2013. Barb, how do you feel right now? One of the issues you were worried about before the deal was made in washington was that taxes would go up for people making under $400,000, so now that's taken care of for now. What are you worried about, if anything? 
>> Well, I think that the first thing is the tax extenders, making sure that at some point they become permanent. We were in a situation where we were very lucky that there was some bipartisan, and we moved from being 200,000 to a 400,000 cap. That helps many small business owners. Some will still be affected by it, and, you know, one of the things that is important is having those tax extenders become permanent because then we can plan for the future. 
>> And are you worried about some surprising tax break that you're getting right now disappearing? 
>> Well, I think that the r & d aspect, also with section 179, you know, there are certain things that, yes, we look at and make decisions to spend money and put it back into the economy, and if those tax extenders were to go away, we would have to withhold on making purchases that would be put back into the economy. 
>> And just to be clear, section 179 means you can expense stuff in one year. 
>> Correct. 
>> You can write off the entire cost of a purchase instead of having to depreciate that cost over a number of years. 
>> Barbara, as small business owners what should we be doing to plan for that uncertainty? Anything we can do, keep cash in the bank, what? 
>> The good news is for at least 2013 we know what the rules are and certainly take full advantage of them so clearly as you're getting towards the end of the year, if you're considering making equipment purchases, take advantage of the rules that exist now rather than gambling on what they are going to be in 2014. 

[00:06:48]


>> Barb, barbara, thank you so much. It's certainly been a difficult time to figure all of this out and we appreciate you coming on and recapping what we can expect for the next year. 
>>> How much do you need and what when do you need it? Those two questions are constantly on the mind of small business owners who are selling their products. Of course, getting customers to buy just part of the process. Once the orders come in, you have to make sure you've got the inventory you need to fill them. 
>> The seed bomb industry went from a kitchen table enterprise to a much bigger operation. It really exploded. 
>> We always try to project where people's minds will be at any given point in time and be ready for that. 
>> We try our best not to fly by the seat of our pants. 
>> The owners of visual lingual in cincinnati, ohio, didn't invent seed bombs, but they package them and turned the concept into a thriving business. 
>> A seed bomb is a mixture of seeds, organic fertilizer and a powdered play. You can throw the seed bombs in the ground, and they will break up on impact. 
>> What started off as requests from smaller retailers in 2009 has turned into sales at places like restoration hardware and anthropology and plenty of custom orders. 
>> It just kind of overnight happened like that where we jumped into high gear and started making these massed quantities of it. 
>> With so much growth the pair knew they needed to change the way they handled orders for their seed bomb pouches and kits. The old way just wouldn't cut it anymore. 
>> We would buy the materials in five-pound increments and make that much and then they would be sending that out pretty much directly. 
>> As a result, they came up with a plan for managing their inventory. 
>> It was a matter of figuring out how do we scale this up? How do we kind of keep a grasp on all this stuff and stay organized and doing the math and figuring we need -- we need 100 times the amount of materials that we use for the last orders. 

[00:08:50]


>> Ever since then it's been a well coreographed act to have inventory and raw material at the ready. 
>> We're going to make a screen so we can print the pouches and we'll print the screen. Same thing with the seed bombs, it's a matter of having the parts that go into the whole on hand or accessible to us. I think it's the biggest thing. 
>> The goal is to be able to accommodate any and all orders that could come in at any time. 
>> I think it's the small business model of the kind of just in time and we respond to orders if they come and we make a little bit of extra so it's there and then it's gone and we go through that cycle again. 
>> We always hope that those reserves are not too much more than is needed because we do prefer to turn inventory around, you know, fairly quickly. 
>> The amount of seed bombs ready to go is based on the popularity of the product. 
>> We're always trying to keep about 150 to 300 units of some of our kind of repeat selling products. 300 is two or three batches and 150 is one or two batches. It's just a feeling of, of course, that's a good amount to have. 
>> We first started, we were definitely making less than that. 
>> Knowing their customers and knowing when they may place their orders are part of the calculated risks they take. 
>> The big wholesale orders that we get have enough lead time that we can really kind of plan out. 
>> Smaller retailers want their stuff quickly because they don't have to plan ahead and they don't have storage, so they order as needed, and they expect it when they need it. 
>> Larger orders definitely require a bit more attention. 
>> We all need to stay on a schedule. We have a finite amount of space, a finite amount of strength, and everything is done by hand. 
>> But it's often those sales that produce the inventory that maya and michael need to respond to smaller orders simultaneously. 
>> We can hang on to produced seed bombs and then screen print the pouches and put the product together very quickly so that's a part of the labor that really doesn't have to happen until it's needed. 
>> Having extra seed bombs is crucial because ideally production takes a few days. 

[00:10:54]


>> We let our seed bombs air dry for a minimum of two days, ideally three days would be how long we want to wait or we need to wait before we will package the product. 
>> Finding multiple suppliers who are willing to act fast helps with the work flow. Maya and michael like having options, too. 
>> If we do need something overnight we can get it overnight and respond to that as quickly as possible. 
>> The pair has found a unique balance between the number of supplies they need and the number of products they can make. 
>> There's kind of a consistent recipe we're using with consistent ingredients, but we might add something a little special here and special there just to make something different whether it's herb seeds or wild flower seeds, changing one of the variables in there gets us to the different product. 
>> The overlap allows for some flexibility and production of the nearly two dozen items being sold. 
>> That product line can be expanded and contracted based on what the trends are, what the season is or what the holiday is. 
>> Of course, the plan doesn't mean there isn't waste. 
>> You never want it to happen, it does happen. 
>> Managing inventory isn't a perfect science, especially when your product is perishable. 
>> We never want to sit on inventory for too long so we don't produce infinite inventory even though we could because it has a finite shelf life. 
>> If you make things and they haven't sold in time and you get a big order, rather than ship that out and have a customer who is disappointed then you know, okay, it's the right business decision to get rid of this product. 
>> Michael says the best advice they can offer other entrepreneurs is to not overthink anything. He believes that a little strategy and occasionally maybe even some luck will allow you to manage your inventory the best you can. 
>> I think it's really about minimizing the number of variables and parts that are at play. If you can do that and get to a point where there's fewer pieces that you really have to think about and guess about and figure out, then the better equipped you are to respond to whatever comes up. 

[00:12:55]


>> Inventory can be a big headache, but I cannot tell you how many small businesses have failed because they have either overestimated or underestimated their inventory needs. So now let's turn to two entrepreneurs who know the importance of managing inventory. Divia is the co-owner of send the trend, a website dedicated to fashion accessories and beauty and jen is a serial entrepreneur better known for creating butler bags. Good to see you both. 
>> Great to be here. 
>> Both of whom have a lot of experience with inventory. Both of you, I'll start with you, jen. How do you figure it out. When you're bigger, you get it. You have these repeat customers and sort of have a formulas but when you're starting out and you're small, how do you figure it out so that all of your capital is not tied up in inventory and yet you can fulfill the needs? 
>> It's actually a really delicate balance, and it's an understanding of how will you have your distribution, in this example anthropology concerns or a big pr push so there's traffic to your website which could up set the balance. It's a really hard formula to an to truly get. The understanding is really to have your finger on the pulse constantly. I suggest for a lot of small businesses, when they have an overflow like they were talking about here, to reach out to the daily deal sites, and this is a newer strategy for small business owners to really get rid of their inventory while building their brand and database, and we've used them a lot. For example, people with perishables, do it with company with short leads, for somebody who doesn't have a perishable work with companies with a long lead and every quarter it's a way to empty out your inventory while you're building your brand. Business owners will say I'll sell it for 50%, 60% and the reality that's what you'll sell it to retailers anyway so this allows the traffic to your website and get new customers you can get. 

[00:15:01]


>> What do you do? 
>> In the early days and you're a small business own as little inventory as possible. You should focus on building your brand, marketing, getting customers, at the same time optimizing inventory, so if you can play the small business card and reach out to manufacturers, your supply base and vendors and get them to work with you, help them help you finance your inventory, whether it's through payment terms, whether through extended credits, it could be any variety of ways, and for us primarily it's on the trend when we first start out is consigning inventory. We don't have money to buy this, but let us put it up on the website, you put it to your facility. When we sell, it right away we'll be ready to take it away. 
>> Is that easy to find someone who will do that? 
>> Depends on the industry and the market. For us we found lots of wling players who believed in our vision. You're an entrepreneur, sell your vision to somebody, get them to believe in your business and you leverage that. Say, hey, listen, we're this tiny company and months from then we're ordering tens of thousands of units. The reality is let them grow with you, and if they see the upside of the promise of that they will want to take the ride. 
>> A perfect panel to talk about this. Thanks, guys. 
>>> Billing clients and tracking hours and expenses can be incredibly easy and streamlined or incredibly disorganized and a time sink. So here now are five ways to master the art of invoicing, courtesy of startupnation.Com. One, use a contract. Set expectations from day one. This can help avoid any misunderstanding down the road. Two, invoice early and often. The sooner you get the invoice to your clients, the sooner they will pay it. Number three, itemize your invoices. Be as clear and specific as possible so ere's no confusion over what they are being billed for. If a client doesn't understand the charges, they are less likely to sign off on the invoice promptly. Four, know who pays you. Find out who actually signs the checks and processes the payments. This information will come in handy if you need to address any outstanding invoices in the future. And number five, follow up on outstanding payments. Send a reminder to your client on the due date and then once per week until the payment is received. 

[00:17:21]


>>> When we come back, we'll have some suggestions on how minority business owners can receive certification, plus some ideas for getting customers back into your stores after the holiday shopping are you. moments. When you lost the thing you can't believe you lost. When what you just bought, just broke. Or when you have a little trouble a long way from home... As an american express cardmember you can expect some help. But what you might not expect, is you can get all this with a prepaid card. Spends like cash. Feels like membership. 
>>> Last week we profiled a company using gameification to increase their users and learning our own lessons from the piece we tried to incorporate gameification ourselves here at "your business" so we asked you to submit your entry in our messiest desk contest on our facebook page. The winner is joyce finnegan of rome, new york, who sent us this picture of her very messy work space saying all I need is a hammer and chisel.

[00:20:04]


>>> The shopmovement got a lot of attention around the holidays packing on small business saturday. This year we're introducing a new segment aimed at maintaining that excitement all year around. And in today's "shopping small" we have several tips. Tom is the host of "open for business" a business and consumer talk show. You can find him online at small town marketing.Com or right here with us. Hey, tom, great to see you. 
>> Great to see you j.J. Thanks for having me. 
>> Tom, you gave me one of my favorite tips in the book that we just released about getting people to come to your store instead of a bik big box store down the street and you said, underprice them and people's reaction is how can I underprice walmart, for instance, what do you do? 
>> Your mom and pop stores can't compete with walmart and kmart and costcos of the world so you can't compete with them dollar-for-dollar so the best thing to do is to compete with them for a short period of time, like an afternoon or a you know, for a few hours. So a couple of quick things about sales, though. They can be dangerous in small towns in small communities and small markets. One thing about sales if you have a 30% margin and you're selling an item for 20% often, you have to sell twice as many of those items to make the same money so if you normally sell ten items to make $100 you'll have to sell 20 to make $100. 
>> Maybe you use it as a leader to get the people in the door and you wow them with all your other services. I want to move on to the next one. Hold an annual grand opening. Would that the be weird in the second year to hold a grand open something. 
>> Well, when you drive down main street all the businesses tend to look alike. And when I first moved to bozeman, I found out our population turns over every seven years. People die, move, get married, born, whatever, new customers are always coming and going and your worst day of business, normally, is your first day of business so what do you do on your first day of business? Have a grand opening so why not reach those new people and this particularly works well if there's an event in town, county fair, something like that, that will draw these people? 

[00:22:36]


>> Got it, okay. Provide buddy coupons for shopping. So this is where I get $10 for myself and if I bri a friend in, is that how it works? 
>> A shop with pay buddy coupon is sort of a spinoff of the restaurants have used this for years. Buy one entree', your second entree' is free or half price or whatever. So what I did was just expanded thiso the retail areas and i use it as a bag stuffer. Where customer comes in and buys something and they take this with them so the next time they come in, they not only come in but hopefully, bring a new customer with them, too. 
>> You talk about employees. You have an amazing marketing resource right there in your own business if you know how to utilize them. 
>> Now they're on twitter, facebook, employees are very, very important in building your business. The average number of people that attend weddings and funerals, 250. That's how many people you're employees know. And -- 
>> you should give them -- 
>> you need an incentive for those employees to bring people in, give them every employee should have business cards and should have incentive to pass those out. 
>> And finally your last tip, beat the competition by packaging. What kind of packaging. 
>> Can if you advertise a single item it's easy to go online and get the price. If you package things together it makes it tougher. McDONALD'S AND ALL THE FAST-FOOD Chains do this with value meals. They package the sandwich with the fries and drink and whatever and you can do the same thing. A dig camera with a case and an extra video card and you know, some other extras or things like that. We're selling value not just the item and also trying to increase add-on sales. 
>> Because one again, you're not going to beat the big box store on price. Tom, thanks for coming on and sharing your tips against small town marketing.Com is where we can find more of these. Have a great day! 

[00:24:40]


>>> As we saw earlier with products flying in and out of your business, tracking all the moving parts can be overwhelming. So if you're looking for a way to help take control of your inventory check county our app of the week. Goods order inventory is designed to help manage orders, stock and sales right from your mobile device. You can use it for free. 
>>> Time to answer some of your business questions. The first one is about getting more customers. 
>> How can we better utilize our referral network of past clients that have been successful with the work we've done? Whether it's through social media or telephone? 
>> So, how do you get your customer, your happy customers to be your marketers. 
>> The best thing to do is get testimonials. Allow them to tell you what the experience was. People trust other people. Put those testimonials on your website. Get photos and success stories. Get case studies. Whatever you possibly can, depending on your industry, here's it's dating. Lots of success stories, marriages made, photos, and really put them prominently on all your marking channels so on the web, on your social media trans, facebook, twitter, create contests. This is a success story of the week. The fan of the week. And really, let them get you new people. 
>> So that gets people. Now you've built up your own site so you have your own marketing. How do you get them to tell their own friends? 
>> To that opponent, testimonials always the most prominent and credible way. Having video, too. So if you're uploading video on facebook or twitter or your website, video allows somebody to hear the story in 30 seconds or having the photos or video adds the credibility so someone can see you face versus text across the screen but also, having a conversation. Room out customers have a conversation on twitter or facebook and talk about your experience so your friends can see what they're saying. That's another really credible way to get people engaged in a conversation and get to watch what's really the story behind it. 

[00:26:48]


>> That's an interesting idea. So suggest a tweet-up. 
>> And then automatically -- 
>> or even a loyalty program for existing customers. A dating site, they found a match and next time you come on we'll give you a reduced rate and the third time it's another reduced rate so they keep coming back and keep using the service you're getting increased sales and put a referral program so if they tell their friends, incentivize their friends. We do a give-and-get program. You can give somebody you're inviting to the site $10 so you give them a gift and you give them $10 toward the site. 
>> Getting an entrepreneur certified. 
>> How do we get certain occasions for minority bids owners. The certification can sometimes take up to six months. How do we that process forward more on a speedy time? 
>> So I can say that it is a long process. And it takes what it takes and you got to make sure you dot all YOUR "I's" AND CROSS ALL YOUR T's. Into is there any way around it? 
>> Simple answer, get involved in politics. Local politics in your area. Know who the policy makers are and who is advocating for things like this and in you're community, getting people on council who are understanding that, hey, if you pay attention to me we'llld the economy in our community and that makes it something that makes them look good so that they're going to push it through more quickly competing with others. 
>> Something makes me think also, this may be taking you six months but once you have the certification you need to know who to go to and who is more apt to hire you. 
>> I have a tally different approach. Go to people who actually have the certification. Find out the tips and tricks from them. People who have been through the process are the best mentors to get you through the process as quickly as possible. 
>> Okay. Guys thanks so much for all the advice. 
>> Thank you.

=======================================================

Deadly flu outbreak. Where you live. And locate a doctor who can treat you if you get sick. But first, ali velshi explains why we still don't have a budget and how our elected officials have bungled a basic business process that most of us handle with ease, it's a must-see "your money" starts right now. 
>>> America's road to economic recovery is wide open. It's right there in front of us. If our elected officials don't put some major road blocks in the way. I'm ali velshi, this is your money. Debt ceilings, budgets and debt ceilings are all you're going to here coming out of washington the next few months and the partisan warfare in washington could put a dent in recovery. The threat is real. The next battle will be another clash over raising the u.S. Debt ceiling. The current ceiling was OFFICIALLY HIT ON DECEMBER 31st. But like last time. The u.S. Treasury is using extraordinary measures to get through about late february or early march. If congress doesn't act by then, the government risks not being able to pay some of its bills. Republicans seem to think the debt ceiling is a useful tool to limit how much the government spends, but that is not what the debt ceiling law is supposed to do. It gives the u.S. Treasury the flexibility to borrow money to pay the government's bills without going to congress to get approval every single time. It has nothing to do with spending control or debt control. Let me be clear, you might think it's about spending control. You might like it to be about spending control. Just like I'd like to be in "people "'s list of 50 most beautiful people. But wishful thinking isn't going to make it happen. Politicians can use the debt ceiling as a hostage. Just like they attempted to use the fiscal cliff in an attempt get something done. Something they haven't been able to do using the normal democratic process, because the system is broken. It puts off dealing with the massive mandatory spending cuts until march1. Republy intend to use the debt ceiling to extract concessions from democrats on spending. Targeting things like social security and medicare. Democrats will stand in their way, the u.S. Will find itself at another dead-end just like 2011. Threatened to shut down the government and possibly result in a credit rating downgrade again. 

[00:02:20]


>>> But outside washington, the road to america's prosperity looks brighter. Foreclosures are down, home sales and housing prices are up. The s&p 500, you y have something like this in your 401(k), IT HIT A FIVE-YEAR HIGH This week. And a rebound in domestic energy production and manufacturing could lead to a true economic renaissance in america. According to the latest forecast, u.S. Oil imports next year will fall to their lowest level in 25 years. That is in part because more supply is coming online right here in america. Already the boom in natural gas extraction has brought prices down to historic lows and all that could mean more high-paying jobs in energy, in manufacturing, in technology. Add all of that up and this economy is poised to soar as long as washington doesn't bring it down. Fareed zakaria is the host of cnn's fareed zakaria "gps." The real deal tovoid the fiscal cliff that may have ruined my new year's plans, you correctly stated was a small victory for sanity. The greater issue is what is missing from that deal and the mini cliffs that we're going to encounter. The debt ceiling cliff, the sequestration cliff and the budget battle. Does it stand in the way of what could be happening in the country? 
>> It stands in the way in two ways. If you're a company that does business with the defense department, if you're watching this sequestration madness. Our the debt ceiling madness, are you going to be hiring new people? Are you going to be expanding production? No, you're going to be wondering, is the defense department budget cut by 20%, 10%? So there is that -- 
>> you will hesitate to make certain business decisions, particularly hiring decisions? 
>> Exactly. Republicans often talk about how uncertainty makes businesses not expand production. Well this is the biggest uncertainty is the craziness over the debt ceiling. And the second biggest is on the sequestration. There's that piece of it. But tre's the broader piece that you and I have talked about. Which is we need to do more than just have a cyclical upturn. What you were describing very elegantly. Exactly right, is that there's a cyclical rise, return of the american economy. Housing is up, energy production is up. But there's a broader issue, which is how do we get the kind of growth we used to have in this country. Three, 4% growth. In order to do that, we have to invest more in this economy. We're investing half as much as we used to. In infrastructure. We're investing half as much in science and technology. And we're investing much less than we used to in core areas of education. State universities for e are being decimated. So if you don't invest for the future, where are you going to get the growth in the future? 

[00:05:04]


>> But in 2008 and 2009, invest became a bad word, invest became government spending. When you're talking about investing, you're talking about it in a fairly sophisticated manner. Some in the government. Some the private sector, each on their own and some jointly. That kind of discussion feels dead on arrival in this political environment where we can't get something like a basic budget done. 
>> The problem is we're going to have to do some of this, anyway. Anyone who owns a home knows this. If you defer maintenance, if you say to yourself, my boiler is leaking but I'm not going to fix it, that's actually a penny wise, pound-foolish decision. It will eventually break and cost you three times as much. That's what's happening with our roads, bridges and highways. If you look at air travel. We have one of the world's most antiquated travel systems, we need to update the antiquated computer system. One day you're going to have terrible problems or you're going to have a kind of the system will break down, it's not going to cost $25 billion. It will cost $50 billion. 
>> There's another thing we don't talk about enough. We're talking about spending as if there's this generally irresponsible spending around. Some of that might be true. The bigger issue is nilements, the growth in what those are going to cost us over time. That's the real threat. It's the one that is hardest to deal with because it's stuff people want. 
>> We don't distinguish as you say between spending that is really on consumption. As I've gimg you a check, whether it's social security or unemployment insurance, whatever it is. Interest deduction on your mortgage. That's stuff that is just, it gets spent. It's not investment for future growth. But when you build a bridge, when you update your air traffic system, you're increasing economic activity. That's going to produce returns for the next 50, 100 years, the brooklyn bridge is still paying dividends. 
>> You've travelled to countries where business gets done. I think india is one example, business gets done despite the fact that government is largely seen as an impediment in many cases. Won't money just find its way around these impediments, if there's business to be done. Won't it get done in spite of lack of vision. 

[00:07:07]


>> No, in places like india, the best thing they have going on for them is they're a very poor country. 
>> You're just getting basic increases in standard of living, india's per capita gdp is $1,500. Our per capita gdp is about $50,000. 
>> Very smart, you're trying to move up the value chain. You've got to have world class, and world-class skilled workforce. That's the piece we haven't talked about. Investing in education. Unless you have all that, yes, we could get economic activity if we were willing to work for you know, $1 an hour. We want to work at $50,000. We want to have real advanced highway jobs. For that, you need to get a lot of things right.

>>> the debt ceiling is the next self-inflicted crisis that congress needs to deal with the debt limit is not like a credit card. It is simply not. It makes me crazy. When republicans and democrats alike, including the president, continue to use this misleading analogy. It's also not the same as your household budget with a few zeros taken out. For those who don't remember the lastime congress pushed us past the debt ceiling, here's how it works. Congress and the president spend money by creating bills and signing them into law. That is when the money is committed. Last year, the u.S. Government spent $3.8 trillion. Two-thirds of that, the green came from revenue. The rest of it, the red, came from borrowing, the deficit. The sum total of all of these annual deficits, plus the interest is national debt. Today the national debt extends at $16.4 trillion. The treasury is empowered to borrow money to make up for that shortfall. But only up to a certain amount. That's the debt ceiling. Keep it in mind, the treasury does not make decisions about how the money is spent. They're simply empowered in this case to borrow money and write the checks to pay the bills incurred by your democratically elected congress. Today the debt ceiling is $16.3 trillion which is less than our debt. The treasury can use extraordinary measures to raise an extra $200 billion. Those extra funds will only last until about mid february or early march according to the bipartisan policy center. Good luck trying to explain this to conservative talk radio show host, rush limbaugh. 

[00:12:38]


>> I think it's a debt limit as your monthly credit card limit. You can't go over it on your credit card. And the united states government can't spend more than what its credit limit is or its debt limit. Now ali velshi at cnn says that has no relation to spending. 
>> That's right, rush, the debt ceiling was create sod the congress wouldn't constantly need to authorize congress to borrow to raise more money. It doesn't authorize any new spending it authorizes payment. It does not increase deficits. It allows the treasury to pay for the things that the u.S. Government has already bought. If the congress doesn't raise the debt ceiling. Treasury won't be able to pay the bills and the u.S. Government will start defaulting on some of its obligations. Here's what happens on february 15th of this year. The federal government will take in an estimated $9 billion in revenue. That's the good news. But compare that to the $52 billion in bills that will need to pay, everything from interest on the debt to pay for members of the military, the bipartisan policy center. Estimates that roughly 40% of the bills for the month would go unpaid. Now what's the consequence of not paying? The truth is, nobody really knows, since it's never happened before. You try telling american express that you're not paying your bill this month because you spent too much money going out to dinner last month. Even talking about not raising the debt ceiling in 2011 caused s&p to lower the u.S. Credit rating because investing in u.S. Debt is so safe. Interest rates are low. 1.85% for 10-year bonds, missing an interest payment could cause those rates to rise. That's not enough to sway some members of congress. They say they need to hold the debt ceiling hostage to get real spending cuts. Ron johnson is a republican senator from wisconsin, a member of the senate budge committee. As I said, the debt ceiling is not actually about future spending, it is for paying for bills that we already bought. Whether or not you think we should spend less money in the united states, do you agree with my premise? 

[00:14:41]


>> No, I don't ali and hello, by the way. What the debt ceiling is all about, is providing the president the authority to borrow more money, put it on the backs of our children and grandchildren. There's no doubt that we are not going to default on our debt. But what the debt ceiling allows or what the debt ceiling allows congress to do is to continue to deficit spend if we would stop incurring deficits, we wouldn't need to increase the debt ceiling. It's not about paying past bills, you bet into the cash flow aspect of this thing. Basically what you're talking about is in order to increase the debt ceiling, we're giving the president the authority to put the burdened on our children and grandchildren. It's not about spending at all. It's about deficit spending. 
>> You said there's no doubt we are not going to default on our payments, the math indicates that if at some point -- why won't we? 
>> Listen, our interest payments this year under $250 billion. We're going to bring in $ 2.5 trillion in tax revenue. Ten times what the servicing on the debt is there is some cash flow aspects of turning over some debt. But basically the only reason you have to increase the debt ceiling is because we continue to deficit spend. We're actually spending $1 trillion more than we're bringing in. 
>> We're not, when you say -- 
>> that's the reason you have to increase the debt ceiling. 
>> When you say we continue to deficit spend. We've deny sit spent under this entire administration, under the entire previous administration as well. This isn't new, we never don't deficit spend. Why would you pick this moment to have that fight? 
>> When do you stop doing that. 
>> Can you come up with a budget? Paul ryan couldn't come up with one. 
>> Well paul ryan did pass a budget in the house. Where we have passed a budget is in the united states senate controlled by democrats for over three years. 
>> Right. 
>> So what we need, what we need to use the debt ceiling moment as, is a moment to educate the american public about all the deficit spending. The fact that we blew through a $2.Billion increase in the debt ceiling in just seven months. We blew through it in 17 months. We have got to start bringing, reducing spending reducing the -- 

[00:17:02]


>> the debt ceiling is a a technicality. You're talking about the budget, you're talking about federal spending. Let me show you a piece of the "wall street journal" and get your comment. They said you can't take a hostage you aren't prepared to shoot. I don't want to ask you about hostages and shooting. I want to ask you a question in a different way. Do you understand that the consequence or what the consequences are of the u.S. Even technically defaulting on its financial obligations and are you willing to let that happen? You talked about interest rates. But the u.S. Government has a lot more to pay than interest. 
>> Ali, I don't want to play brinkmanship. When you start coming to the fact that we continue not to run deficits over $1 trillion per year. Our interest rate is going to increase and interest expense n, you know if we just revert to our 30-year average interest costs from 1970 to 1999, that adds $600 billion in interest costs per year, that's what we're trying to prevent. My suggestion is we incree the debt ceiling in incremental amounts until we get president obama to get serious about reducing spending. 
>> So you will increase it. 
>> You will vote increase it in an incremental amount? 
>> There's a good construct in terms of giving you know, $1 of increase in the debt ceiling for every dollar in deficit reduction. That's what we have to start using the debt ceiling to impose the spending discipline on this administration. And president obama saying that we don't have a spending problem. We have a spending problem in this nation. We have a deficit spending problem. That's where we have to start getting it under control. This debate is not going away. 
>> We've heard all of the, bumper stickers, let me bring you balk to my example of FEBRUARY 15th. We have $52 billion in committed spending. There isn't a chest of money sitting around for all the extra stuff. I've got a list, interest, which is the one you're talking, about the biggest parks $30 billion. We're talking in nine. We have 30 in interest. You've said there are other ways to handle that. You've got tax refunds, 6.6 billion. Federal salaries 3.5 billion. Military pay, 2.7 billion. Medicare, medicaid, 3.2 billion. Defense vendors, which one are you cutting, sir? 

[00:19:15]


>> Ali, you're taking a look at one day's -- 
>> I could pick any day. 
>> Let's take a look at a year. In a year we'll get about 2.5 droin worth of tax revenue. Last year we spent 3.5 trillion. If you actually utilized the social security trust fund to make the social security payments, that's another 775 million. Now you're up to revenue of 3.2 trillion. You're basically funding all of government. We, I don't want to play brinksmanship. We should make sure that we can fund as much of government as revenues coming in. But we have got to start seriously taking a look at how we reduce the rate of growth and spending. Nobody is talking about cutting government in total. Reducing the rate of growth in government so we stop adding all this burden of debt to our children and grandchildren. That's what the debt ceiling is b. How much are we going to allow the president to increase the debt burden on his children and grandchildren. He says he doesn't want to have that debate. Any time we talk about that, it should be a serious debate. We've got it start coming to terms with that. 
>> I'm glad that you don't want to play brinksmanship. I guess my point is the raising of the debt ceiling beyond the money that we're at right now is for money that is already committed. So that is not actually more spending. 
>> No, it is not. It is not. It is to pay for additional deficit spending. Which i, I agree with you, nobody says we can start balancing our budget immediately. But what republicans are saying is, if you're going to increase the debt burden on our children, at least start working with us to restrain the rate of growth in spending over the next few years so we can start bringing our budget into balance. So we don't totally mortgage our children's future. That's what this debate should be about. 
>> You are right, it should be about that. We're going to discuss it later in the show. The idea about why we don't have budgets, how we can fix that. Senator, thanks for the time to talk to us, we hope we can talk to you more in coming weeks. 
>> Have a great day. 
>> Senator johnson is a republican from wisconsin. He is on the senate budget committee. The fiscalonsense, the fiscal cliff and the exploding debt how did we get here? 

[00:21:24]


>> We haven't had one in almost four years. 
>> I could end the deficit in five minutes. 
>> How? 
>> You pass a law that says that any time there's a deficit of more than 3% of gdp, all sitting members of congress are ineligible for re-election.

[00:24:21]


>>> uncle sam's biggest problem is in his wallet. It's been four years since your federal government had a real budget. There have been some political stunts to make it seem like budgets were failing in congress. Bills put forward for an up or down vote. That's not how the system works, there's never been a budget passed like that. And there probably never will be. It's not how it's designed to work. Christine romans is host of "your bottom line." Set us straight if government were working properly, how would we actually get a budget done? 
>> It is a complex process and it starts with the president. By law, the commander-in-chief is the one who is required to submit a budget proposal to congress, before the first monday in february. Since the constitution grants the power of the purse to congress, final budget decisions are really up to it. Let's talk about that. Once the proposal gets to congress. Budget committees in the house and the senate work with public officials an other congressional committees to decide on a budget president. And that's where it starts to get interesting. The budget president serves as a guide for all spending and revenue decisions for the year. At least that's how it's supposed to work in theory. None of this, ali, has happened since 2009. 
>> We're going to discuss why, christine, thanks very much. 
>>> Why don't we have a budget? Gridlock. Senate majority leader, harry reid, a democrat, says it was not worth trying to go through the process of passing the president's budget. That's why you hear that old republican saw that harry reid won't even present a budget to the senate. You may have also heard the often-repeated claim that president obama's budget was struck down in the house and the senate, getting zero votes. Goose eggs from either party. But those bills were not the budget. They were shell versions of the president's budget put forward by republicans, designed to fail. They were not budgets this he were just politics. Republicans did put out their own budget plan in the form of paul ryan's path to prosperity. But bipartisan bickering resulted in no progress there, either. Part othe reason our government has been able to survive without a budget is because ofomething called continuing resolutions. Which are essentially an extension of the existing budget. So it is not true as many of you enjoyed tweeting me, that the u.S. Doesn't have a budget. We just haven't had a new one in some years and that is a bad thing. It's also not true that obama's budget got no votes, because that wasn't obama's budget. The sad truth is that we do not have a budget in the united states, a new one and there are consequences for that, not the least of which are the dozen or so close calls with government shutdowns in the past few years. 

[00:26:52]


>>> Plus, the continuing resolutions, they're short-term. They avoid tackling long-term problems like federal debt and the deficits. The uncertainty ofat short-term thinking wreaks havoc on businesses and their investment and unemployment. Look no further than the debt ceiling showdown in summer of 2011, that led to the budget control act which was a last-minute deal to raise the debt ceiling in exchange for automatic cuts that were to take place at the end of 2012. You know those, as the sequester, which I've said many times, is a stupid name for a stupid thing that only washington could come up with. Big surprise, with those sequester cuts, b the way, washington gave themselves another extension, two more MONTHS, SO MARCH 1st, AMERICA Has another cliff to worry about going over. These people are really worse than a fourth grade flunkie who why not write to your constituents sand say, sorry that dog ate my homework. The mangy dog has been the american political proces america's chief export seems to be economic uncertainty. Incredibly that only seems to be getting worse, what's the likelihood of this changing. 
>> When you have the mini cliffs ahead of us and seeing ugly politics in the next few weeks and months this might be capitulation, right? This might be this moment where you're going to see the system thrashing around, getting through this, and the optimist in see says after that you're going to have deficit reduction, you're going to have an eye to debts and deficits and a blueprint for what kind of country we're going to be, that's what a budget is, right? The budget is the blueprint for what your priorities are, what your vision is, for the american standard of living. The continuing budget resolutions are not a vision, they're nothing like a vision. I think that if you can get through this very tortured time over the next maybe three to six months, maybe after that. We'll start talking about what the vision is going to be for america again. 
>> I hope you're right, the last congress accomplished something america hasn't seen in 40 years, much ado about nothing. And later, "rolling stone's" matt taibbi will join me, and explain why he's warning that the worst of wall street is yet to come. ?????? ?????? ?????? ??????

From td ameritrade. Richard quest is the host of "quest means business" on cnn international. Before we start I want to show our viewers the timeline thaw sent us, you call these do-or-die moments in washington. In late 2010, democrats and republicans started to fight over extending the bush tax cuts for wealthy americans, ultimately, president obama signed an extension of the tax cuts for all taxpayers. Now four months later, the president and congressional leaders cut a budget deal that cut $38 billion in federal spending for the year. That agreement, if you recall, came less than tw hours before the government would have shut down. In august of the same year, the white house and congress were in the same pition, bumping up against the debt ceiling, the provision of the deal created the fiscal mess which we have still not solved. At congress closed out 2011 with the payroll tax cut and unemployment benefits, two days before christmas. Yet another massive fight on relatively modest stop-gap measure that both sides had largely agreed on. Of course I don't need to remind you about the fiscal cliff fight that we just got done with. Congress could not come to an agreement even as massive spending cuts and tax hikes were schedulee effect. Congress still hasn't had enough. Now we have three more fights looming. The debt ceiling isn't raised by mid february or early march, the government won't be able to pay its bills, which would put the united states' credit rating at risk and damage the fragile economic recovery. While congress did resolve the tax portions of the fiscal cliff. They put off a decision of the sequester, the spending cuts that fight will play out in march. Finally, because the president and congress have not been able to agree on a budget since april of 2009, the u.S. Government is operating on the continuing budget resolutions, the current one expires at the end of march. Will, you say this dysfunction is a symptom of an underlying problem that we are not talking about -- please explain to me what that underlying problem is. 

[00:34:20]


>> The schedule you just laid out has been extremely advantageous to you in this program, because it's giving everyone to talk about. You look at the congress, particularly sometimes you've focused in in on republicans as using leverage to get essentially the federal budget in order, to fight over what our priorities are in spending and taxes. And sometimes I think you're 100% right. I don't like seeing republicans use the debt ceiling in particular as a moment of leverage. But you're focusing on symptoms of the crisis, not the cause. The fact that for 44 months this congress has not passed a budget, 44 months, almost four years, we have no idea what the priorities of this government are. 
>> As christine pointed out, the budget are the priorities of a government. I want to discuss how serious this might be. Let me show you the poll from gallup. About the way the politics work in washington. Three-quarters of americans say it's causing serious harm to the united states. But 52%, 52 are optimistic that the way politics works will improve in the next ten years. I think they think we're also going to domesticate unicorns. Democrats control the senate and republicans control the house representatives, that stayed the same. Why would anybody think this getting better? 
>> There's something known as the optimism bias, which is well known in social science, we all tend to be a little more optimistic than our real experience tells us. I love the optimism bias, that's what makes you believe you can write a book, if you can't write the deadline. Believe you can get up and face the day. Thank god for the optimism bias, I think this is just a view, not social science backed. My personal belief as a non-american who loves america, is that americans particularly prone to the optimism bias, and that is great. Having said that when it comes to these political battles, i think actually a do-nothing congress is not always a bad thing. Not tacking things -- 

[00:36:27]


>> I agree -- 
>> it's not always bad. 
>> When I tweeted that information out, somebody said to me, the job of congress is not just t pass as many bills as they can. There may be something to the fact that we're not passing as many bills. 
>> Right. Exactly and right now I think these artificial crises, because they are man-made, these are not things that the world economy is forcing upon the united states, in contrast say with europe. I think the best thing for america, for anyone who runs a business, for anyone who wants a job, would be if the debt ceiling and the sequester, people just forgot about. For 12 months. 
>> This is an interesting point. Richard, I think we may be lying to people. About christine says it you say it and I say it. That businesses hate uncertainty. You know what all we've had is uncertainty and the stock market is at a five-year high. 
>> Can you call this certainty. It's happening with such frequency that it can be certainty. 
>> It just the new normal? Can we just forget about this and move on? 
>> They like certainty and markets will wobble if there's no certainty. But business gets on with doing business. They learned how to trade in the most unfavorable scenarios. Look at the great recession, 2008, 2009. Business knows what has to be done. It has to cut back when it has to spend more. All of those sort of things, when it has to shift production. When it shifts production to low-cost environments, so business, corporations and comies they know what happens to be done. 
>> The main point, ali, you talked about the fragile recovery and it is fragile. But it is a recovery and I think that now that washington has gotten past the big tax debate. The best thing would be do no harm. It's a fragile recovery. Let it get stronger, this is not the time for the grand budget bargain that some people are talking about. 
>> Both of these people have pointed out things that I would agree with. Essentially -- 
>> doebts be so surprised. 
>> Business is resilient. Business can operate in a case environment. 

[00:38:27]


>> It has to. 
>> We wish it could operate in an optimal environment just because you pass more laws than a congress tat may follow you, does not make you a better congress. And some of this fight, some of the crisis is natural. It's going to happen when you must make difficult decisions about your spending and taxing. Natural consequences of a big, big choice. 
>> It's also a product of the system you've got and I'm with you on everything. Love this country. Lived here. But if the system you've got. 
>> An efficient parliamentary system would be so much better to get things done. Always. 
>> At least it does get things done. 
>> I think richard and I came to this agreement l week. Certain things for which the american political system works better and certain things where the parliamentary system works better. 
>> The key is what you want to get done. 
>> Right. 
>> The other issue is, will, is that the american system is well designed for a country which has an effective political consensus. The divided government, which is structurally there works when you have parties that are able to come to an agreement do deals. The reality right now is I think 9 nation is quundamentally divided and certainly the elected representatives are very much divided. 
>> I'm the only american standing at this table. 
>> All right. So you're -- 
>> you're the odd man out. What the rest of the world cannot have is more of what you were just showing. Month after month after month. 
>> You guys did in europe, you must feel good about this when you come up here and say you guys are as disorganized as we are will is not going to shave the debt ceiling is raised. 
>> Right. Debt ceiling beard. Richard stick around. You're not going to have timothy ithner to kick around any more. 
>> As a kid growing up in queens I had dreams of making a difference in the world. 
>> As jack lew gets to make a difference now, he's going to be the next treasury secretary of theunited states. Will he make a difference? Richard and I go head to head for some q&a after this.One. But you're alone. I knew you'd come. Like I could stay away. You know I can't do this without you. You'll never have to. You're always there for me. Shh! I'll get you a rental car. I could also use an umbrella. Fall in love with progressive's claims service. 

[00:43:22]


>>> New term, new treasury secretary. President obama has nominated jacob jack lew to be his next treasusecretary. He's 57 years old. He's got the weirdest signature ever. Which is soon going to appear on a dollar bill near you. Lew has been the white house chief of staff. He's described as a budget wonk and a consummate washington insider. Lew has done two stints as the head of the office of management and budget. You'll know that as the omb. Under presidents obama and clinton. He was a key player during the 2011 debt ceiling talks that almost shut down the government. He'll have his work cut out for him. Democrats and republicans on capitol hill are gearing up for another battle over extending the debt ceiling while the global embarrassment that serves as the economic policy debate in washington these days, I've got a huat timothy geithner won't mistaking part in another one of those showdowns. But why should the rest of the world care if jack lew or anyone else is running the u.S. Treasury? Joining me now, he's taken off his jacket. He's got his suspenders, richard quest. A little q&a. I'll do the same thing. Richard quest, host of "quest means business." On cnn international. Does it matter who the.S. Treasury secretary is for the rest of the world? Give me 60 seconds on your bell. Generally I doubt most americans are all that concerned about the treasury secretary. But in 2008, who it was mattered a lot to the world. Gooit timothy geithner was the right guat the right time. Because the global banking system was teetering on the edge of collapse. He knew the ins and outs of wall street, the commercial banks, global credit and central banks. Co-in obama's words, hit the ground running. Jack lew is a budget wonk and his nomination will be mostly and american affair this time around. The u.S. Has a budget problem, it's an internal problem. It may blow a hole in the american hull, but china is not going to start selling off the u.S. Dollars because the government doesn't have a budget and might shut down. Democrats and republicans can't agree on how to cut our bloated expenditures, but that's an internal washington. Washington needs an inside man at treasury. Jack lew is an inside man. So as long as the world doesn't implode. Americans much less the world will pay little attention to who heads the u.S. Treasury.

>> What do you think? 
>> What do I think? It's really very simple. Simple once again. It's not as easy as it's now a domestic issue with the budget battle. If only it were. This is all about who the man is, and what does he bring to the table. If we look back at treasury secretaries, paul o'neand john snow, they were major men in their own industry. Nobody remembers them and they were not huge successes. Lloyd benson. A great man in his field. But did not bring much to the table. Now you look at paulson, geithner, summers, even morgan. They were men who were able to make the treasury work. There's no doubt that jack lew comes with the authority of the president and the white house. But he has to go further than that. He has to take the financial community, the g-8, the imf, the world bank, if he can't do that, then he is sunk. 
>> We will be watching this and talking about that lot. Good to see you, brother. Richard quest, the host of cnn international's "quest means business." President obama gave big props to the man jack lew is replacing. 
>> When history books are written, timothy geithner will go down as one of our finest secretaries of treasury. 
>> Matt taibbi of "rolling stone" joins us after the break to tell us why he thinks the president is dead wrong on geithner, why he argues that the bailouts may have rescued wall street but didn't come anywhere near fixing the budget. ink... your business needs... at prices that keep you...out of the red.

>>> This week we got a stark reminder of the audacity and bullish attitude that still rules wall street. Aig, the troubled insurance giant that was given a aig, remember that name? The troubled insurance giant that was given a $182 billion taxpayer bailout to stay afloat, this which can aig considered joining a shareholder lawsuit against taxpayers challenging the terms of the bailout which saved the company and possibly planet earth from financial meltdown. I know what you're thinking. How could they? Well, outrage followed and aig said they wouldn't join the lawsuit after all but the company is holding off on giving us the reason why. To be fair, aig have publicly thanked for your help. 
>> We've repaid every dollar america lent to us. 
>> Everything plus a profit of more than $22 billion. 
>> For the american people. 
>> Thank you, america. 
>> Helping people recover and rebuild. That's what we do. Now, let's bring on tomorrow. 
>> Government did turn a $22 billion profit on the deal, and I know aig has a responsibility to its shareholder, employees, and customers to be successful. What does this episode say about the state of wall street in washington right now? Matt taibi is a masterful writer with rolling stone, I think -- i like matt a lot. He's a little bit crazy but masterful at putting this argument forward. You start with mentioning that the funds were used in some ways for retention bonuses. This latest chapter doesn't help aig's reputation. You really say the government failed in changing the way wall street this. 
>> No, I think what the real lesson, my assignment was to look at the bailout, was it an accomplishment, was it not? What I think we focused on in the end was they told so many lies on behalf of these companies over the years. In the interest of instilling confidence in the markets, that in the end they ended up vouching for a system that was bankrupt or was insolvent. We're stuck vouching for that system now. That's the problem. Where does that end? When you start lying for a company, you end up having to keep doing it over and over again. You have to publicly endorse the health of these companies. That's the ongoing legacy of these ilouts. 

[00:52:07]


>> Where does it end is an interesting theme of your story. In fact, I want to read a line from it on the first page. Wouldn't have to get far into it. It said we thought we were just letting a friend crash at the house for a few days and ended up with a family of hillbillies who moved in forever, sleeping nine to a bed and building a meth lab on the front lawn. Who are the hillbillies here and sleeping nine to a bed and who's got the meth lab? 
>> Look at the hsbc settlement last month or the ubs settlement four years ago. Could you have imagined we would let banks off for laundering $9 billion for terrorists and mexican drug cartels? The rationale they gave was similar to the rationale they gave for endorsing the solvency of banks that were insolvent. They said we have to do these because these are systematically important companies and we can't let something happen to them because if it happens to them, we'll have another disruption. 
>> You said there might have been some hope in the way the bailout was originally structured. Within days, it changed into something else and within days it changed into something else. It went from something that was going to help america through its banks into helping homeowners and banks into something that was just about banks. 
>> Then it became something that what didn't even necessarily help banks. The original rationale is we're going to give a whole bunch of money to healthy, viable banks to help start to grease the economy and start lending all over again andtimulate business activity all over the country. What it turned into is we're going to fill capital holes for failing institns and get no new lending stimulated and not going to create business and jobs. That's sort of the situation we ended up with. 
>> You look at the last 30-some-odd months where we have actually created jobs and the stock market which a lot of our viewers invest in through 401(k)s IS AT A HIGH. Do you attribute any of that to the bailout? 
>> Absolutely. I do. The question is will it continue. The proof is in the pudding. Is the situation sustainable or not? It comes down to do you believe these too-big-to-fail banks are solvent? Do you believe in their accounting and they're going to remain healthy or do you believe there's trouble with ahead? 

[00:54:24]


>> The way I teased you were coming on is that president obama really, really spent a lot of time talking about tim geithner and the applause he got in the white house was extended. You don't -- you think tim geithner and neil barofsky, the inspector general of t.A.R.P., you both think geithner's more part of the problem than the solution? 
>> I think, you know, I agree with barofskyon a lot of these points. Tim geithner's legacy, he's going to be remembered as the architect of too big to fail. He had the opportunity to go in and correct a lot of problems, restore fiscal honesty and transparency in the system and instead, they papered over the problem and threw a lot of money at corrupt failing institutions and they created these sort of monsters that now we have to publicly back even when they're laundering money for terrorists and drug dealers. 
>> You write an article like this, it gives you strange bedfellows and puts you into bed with a lot of conservatives who say we shouldn't have had the bailout? 
>> I believe it should have been done differently with conditions. It should have been done in a way that encouraged transparency instead of papering over problems. But I do believe this is an inherently conservative issue. I think there should be some linkage betweeberals and conservatives because it's not a partisan issue at all. 
>> It's a good read. Matt's article called "secrets and lies of the bailout." Matt is a contributing editor with "rolling stone." 
>>> Coming up, this hi-tech jumbo jet was supposed to change the industry. I'll tell you what I think next. Let's do this Larry! Ooh, I got it, I got it!

>>> One week, five mechanical glitches and billions of dollars on the line for a major u.S. Company. I'm talking about the boeing 787 dreamliner. Boeing's latest and greatest hi-tech jet. Monday, a japan airlines dreamliner filled with smoke after landing. Tuesday, another had to be towed back to the gate in boston because of a fuel leak. Wednesday, an all nippon dreamliner was grounded in tokyo because of a systems error in the cockpit. Two more incidents on friday, an oil leak and crack in the window, both in japan. Boeing executives say they still have extreme confidence in the 787. The federal aviation administration, not so much. It opened a probe into the design, manufacture and assembly of the dreamliner. Boeing says it welcomes the review. I have flown on the dreamliner. They are sweet, no question about it, but at $200 million a pop, boeing has 800 of the planes on order from airlines. Now mechanical glitches since its debut in 2011. Safety comes first in the airline industry but profits come second. If any airlines start pulling orders, boeing will be in trouble with. New airplane programs usually have issues in the first couple of years. Bottom line is transportation SECURITY SECRETARY ray LaHood says this plane is safe to fly. Let's hope he's right. What's your take on the dreamliner or anything else
