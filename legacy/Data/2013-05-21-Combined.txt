>> ?????? Inspector dax inspector dax ?????? 
>> I think it was all for publicity for the movie when they got back together. After the d.V.D. Release, suddenly they break up. He packs his car full of stuff and moves out of her house. 
>> I'm not buying this. 
>> What about if he's going to good will? 
>> How do you know it's not good will? 
>> Everyone is talking about the fact they've broken up. 
>> I don't care. You're trying to connect dots that may not connect. 
>> This is the part where inspector dax has to go out and prove himself. 
>> You're off the case! >>?????? Inspector dax, his theory sucks have to clear his name??????

>> I've taken my dog to good will before. 
>> Oh, shut up, dennis. 
>> You two are working together on this one now.

[00:06:02]

>> I have not. 
>> Where the people are all fat and live in a bubble. 
>> The animation movie?

>> and now, well, this is like come on, dude. Sorry, keef 
-- chief keef. 
>> Well, it's official, cops in georgia are super lame. They arrested chief keef. 
>> No, not that chief. This chief. He's a 17-year-old rapper with that one song. Yeah, that one. And keef's already had a rough year, recently being sued for child support and now cops busted him on monday and are allegedly smoking weed. Here's how the call came in to 911. 
>> A bunch of gentlemen rolling marijuana and smoking in the room. 
>> Ok. 
>> All those guys may just bolt. 
>> Right, because if there's one thing stoners love, it's exercise. So what's chief's defense? 
>> Come on, dude. 
>> Thank you, counselor. 
>> He's in a hotel room smoking weed. Probably on tour. He's not like harming anyone or messing with anyone. 
>> Yeah, what's so bad about that? 
>> If I'm staying in a hotel, i don't want to smell weed next door. 
>> And turn down your music, hippy! 
[00:08:05]



>> A lot of people are allergic to it. 
>> I've never heard of anyone being allergic to weed. 
>> I had horrible reactions when I was around it as a kid. 
>> Yeah, he got a lot meloer and didn't care about money. And that's when he said never again. 
>> Is it necessary to arrest him and all that? 
>> Give him a ticket. 
>> Just like if someone smoked cigarettes in a hotel room. 
>> I'd arrest most people too. 
>> Oh, that sound means it's time for closing arguments defense? 2013, man. 
>> Solid. 
>> And defenseless? 
>> Asthma. Had asthma as a kid. 
>> Also solid. 
>> It's not legal in georgia.

>> I'm great. How are you? 
>> Good.

>> Can I ask you a quick question? 
>> Hey, it's the golden state warriors' $80 million power forward david lee. Partying in hollywood. He was a first-round draft pick, a two-time nba all-star, but most importantly

=======================================================

I human terms without the politics. I think we'll do a great job tonight. Stay with msnbc. Thanks for being with us tonight on "hardball." Our coverage continues now on "politics nation." 
>> Good evening from new york. I'm chris hayes thank you for joining us on this day two of the tragedy in moore, oklahoma coming to a close. We know more this evening about the sheer power of the massive tornado that devastated this community. We know more about the scope of the damage visited upon this town and we know more of the amazing acts of courage by teachers in two schools crushed by the storm. The good news today and it's not to be able to report good news in the midst of this, initial reports of fatalities have been cut in half. The oklahoma city medical examiner last night having placed the number of dead at 51 this morning revised that number to 24 confirmed deaths. A spokesman explaining that some victims were counted twice in the initial chaos. The monster tornado has now officially been deemed to have reached ef-5 status in at least one area according to survey crews which estimated peak winds of 210 miles per hour. Its force is estimated to have been 8 to 600 times greater than that of the atomic bomb which exploded in hiroshima. It touched down 16 minutes after the first warning was sounded. Funnel quickly intensified and within four miles and ten minutes later reached category 4. Its t similar to the one from 1999. The tornado was on the ground for 17 miles creating a path of carnage that was at its greatest 1.3 miles wide. The number of homes destroyed is unknown. 237 people are reported injured including 70 children and 34,000 people have lost power in moore, oklahoma city and other affected areas. At the plaza towelementary school the search for survivors continue today after 200 people work through the night. 
[00:02:24]



>> It was a very surreal coming up on the school because there was no school. There was just debris. It was piled very high it was hard to tell what was there. 
>> Fema director craig fugate says search and rescue in the entire affected area will continue until everyone is found and stories of neighbors helping neighbors are already pouring in. 
>> We pulled a bunch of people out. A lot of them are elderly people. We pulled some younger people out too. Some didn't make it. Some did. Most of them did that we were involved with. I kicked the door in to save this one elderly lady and her grandkids and stuff and she had just gotten inside the house when it hit. She was still in the living room. The living room was obliterated. I don't know how she made it but she did thank god. 
>> President obama having last night declared a state of emergency in oklahoma today said oklahoma will get everything it needs. 
>> The people of moore should know that their country will remain on the ground there for them beside them as long as it takes. 
>> Today also produced as it would in the age of instant eyewitness video mortube videos of the storm. Due to widespread tornado damage and continuing severe weather across oklahoma, the state emergency operations center remains activated. Joining me right now from moore, oklahoma, msnbc's thomas roberts and, thomas, I see some folks in the background of the shot. We've been seeing them all day as we've been watching what's going on unfold. What are people doing right now in the aftermath of this? Are they returning to their homes? Are they out of the area? What are folks trying to do today on the day after this disaster happened? 
>> Reporter: Well,ight now, chris, it's a beautiful contradiction here in moore, oklahoma. The evening is absolutely perfect. As we look around, it's complete devastation after a little over 24 hours now we know that that tornado that ripped through here is categorized as an ef-5. There's a young couple behind me who rode out the storm in their bathtub. First time back to their home this evening. That's amber, the blonde, behind me. She's talking about the bathtub which is right to the right-hand side of that toilet if you can make that out over my shoulder. She was in that bathtub with her husband, nathan and their three little kids. They have two 4-year-old twins and one 6-year-old daughter. They got in the bathtub over the top of the girls with couch pillows and pulled a blanket over the top of them and rode out the storm that way. They emerged from the bathtub unscathed. The girls didn't have scratch on their heads. There were pipes burst all around them but climbed out and went to family. Now earlier today it was rainy. It was very windy and there were some people that did come out to survey the damage early on and then it got worse where people just fled. We've been here all day. This is the first time we've seen nathan and amber come back. Lots of other people have come back along this street as well. But for amber she's just trying to find something for her 6-year-old daughter that she can claim as a memento because her twins walked away with their blankets so they have something so they want something for their daughter. Her 6-year-old goes to the elementary school and was done by 11:30 and her mom picked her up by the time the storm came through. I asked her if she's aware of any other friends of her daughter that may have perished at the school and she said she's not aware of any of those teachers. That elementary school plaza towers was the worst hit where they say seven plus students may have died there and you brought up the tally in and of itself. They have brought down that number. The earlier reports were much higher. It remains at 24 right now. As we broke down that number. It's 20 people in moore and four people in oklahoma city and then nine of those victims are children. The first victim that was identified is a little 9-year-old girl who was a student at plaza towers elementary school. It really is just devastating. I had an opportunity to walk around the neighborhood and talk to everybody. They're so grateful they have their loved ones and they were able to walk away mostly unscathed but it's heartbreaking to see how these people are coming back. I asked amber homeowner here for the last 12 years and I asked her if she wants to rebuild and she said she doesn't know. She said the next house, no matter where it is, will have a basement. 
[00:07:15]



>> And that bathtub too. That's an incredible story. Thomas roberts, thank you so much. Appreciate it. 
>> Great minds think alike. I asked her about the bathtub and if she would take it to the new house if they moved and she said she just might. 
>> Yesterday's massive tornado was categorized as an f-5 in at least one area. Joining me to put that in perspective and to illustrate the strength of an ef-5 tornado is paul douglas, meteorologist and founder of weather nation tv. Here's my question, paul. This is the question of a person who is not a meteorologist and doesn't quite necessarily really understand in a deep way how a tornado works. I do not 
-- don't understand the images of destruction I'm seeing. You can look at hurricanes going through areas and floods and we've been covering disasters a lot because we live in a disaster prone age. I can't get my head around how the conditions are produced that create a storm powerful enough to do the thing that we are all now watching the aftermath of. 
>> It's a great question, chris. There is a disconnect. The united states is ground zero for tornadoes. 90% of all twisters worldwide form here. The same attributes that make our nation so beautiful, the geographical features and disparities and contrasts also can conjure up this witch's brew of meteorological ingredients and there's nothing more difficult of trying to predict a tornado. It's like a sneeze. They are atmospheric hiccups. We can tell when conditions are right but trying to pin down when the ultimate intensity will be is still very fraught with peril. We're not there yet. It turns out that a tornado isn't so much an object as it is a process. One that takes many hours to unfold. We have an animation explaining the dynamics involved. Of course you need moisture from the gulf of mexico but overlaid in the mid layers of the atmosphere you need dry, cool air. Those conditions usually converge over the plains states traditional tornado alley or even dixie alley just east of the mississippi. In recent years we're seeing an eastward trend to some of the most severe tornadoes. The winds always increase as you rise up through the atmosphere. This creates a horizontal wind shear. When you have an intense thunderstorm, intense updraft, that thunderstorm is able to focus the horizontal shear about a vertical axis and then like an ice skater that brings her arms in and spins faster, you have all this moisture and energy being focused around this vertical axis. In a typical thunderstorm, it usually snuffs itself out within 30 to 45 minutes. In these supercell thunderstorms, they tilt over slightly due to wind shear and that protects the warm updraft and it asse the warm updraft so instead of dying out after 45 minutes, it goes on hour after hour and in the process you have enormous amounts of energy focusing in right around the central core and ultimately something called a rear flank downdraft, a surge of drier, cooler air pulls the circulation down to the ground and we have a tornado. Out of 100 thunderstorms, maybe one or two will ever go on to produce a tornado. That's the good news. They are exceedingly rare and odds of seeing an f-5 probably comparable to winning the powerball lotto. Odds are low. The fact that moore has seen three major tornadoes since 1999 is just unheard of. Oklahoma is the heart of tornado alley. THEY'VE HAD 13 EF-5s JUST SINCE 1902 in the state of oklahoma and oklahomans are incredibly tornado aware. They know what to do. My nightmare scenario is what happens if something like that hits in nashville or chicago or in atlanta or even washington d.C. There was an ef-4 tornado 30 miles south of the white house 11 years ago. 2002. It hit in maryland. Most people don't realize that. Yes, tornado alley sees the most tornadoes but we're seeing an apparent eastward shift into dixie alley and hoosier alley, illinois, kentucky, parts of ohio have seen incredible tornadoes in recent years. We don't know if that's a manifestation of climate change as we discussed yesterday. No sound science yet that a warmer atmosphere necessarily means more severe tornadoes. Yes, it does mean more instability. But there's more water vapor and fuel for these severe thunderstorms but in a warmer atmosphere you should have less wind shear and that would tend to negate some of these other factors. There's not enough data. We need more research. You can't connect the dots. There's no causal connection. It's something we're going to be watching very carefully.

>> Teachers who gave their all to shield their children with the neighbors, first responders and emergency personnel who raced to help as soon as the tornado passed and with all of those who as darkness fell searched for survivors through the night. 
>> That was president obama this morning acknowledging the courageous efforts of rescue workers and ordinary citizens most notably the teachers. Plaza towers elementary school and briarwood elementary school. Oklahoma officials do not know how many students were in the two elementary schools when they suffered a direct hit from the storm. All of the students at briarwood have been accounted for. However, at least seven children at plaza towers elementary were skilled. Both schools were reduced to rubble and according to oklahoma officials neither school had safe rooms for students and teachers to take shelters. Nor did the schools have basements. A second grade teacher at briarwelementary was with seven children when the ceiling collapsed pinning them to the ground. She survived and said her thoughts were on children and keeping them calm. At a nearby day care center, a staff hustled 15 children to two bathrooms draping them with a protective covering and singing songs to keep them calm as the wind ripped the roof off and they remained calm singing "you are my sunsne." Maybe the most remarkable story comes from plaza towers elementary where a teacher put herself directly between the kids and the storm. 
>> I was in a stall with some kids. I laid on top of them. One of my little boys kept saying I love you. Please don't die with me. I never thought I was going to die. The whole time I just kept screaming to them, quit worrying. We're fine. We're fine. We're fine. 
>> Joining me now is theresa mosier. I'm so glad that you are safe and thank you very much for joining us. Can you walk us through what that day was like and at what point you knew a tornado was headed your way and what the teachers in the school did and what you did. 
[00:20:23]



>> It was a pretty normal day until the afternoon. We knew that we were going to have thunderstorms but it wasn't until the afternoon that we started to realize that they were getting severe and we noticed that the children were starting to be checked out by some of the parents. Later on our administrator came across the intercom and told us that we were to start taking tornado precautionary measures and that it was not a drill so that's when we immediately started taking our children and getting them against the wall and going into our precautionary tornado measures. 
>> What are those measures? Obviously you drill on them there because tornadoes are common there. What exactly did you do with the students you had? 
>> We're kind of in a different type of building. We don't have hallways. We have pods. So all we have are inside walls so we get our children up against the inside wall and have them get down on their knees and lower their heads and put their arms over their head and just stay in that position until, you know, up until then it just had been until a drill was over. That's what w do. 
>> So you have your fourth graders, I believe, against the wall and they are down. Are they freaking out? Are they scared? Did they recognize what's coming? 
>> Yes. You could hear the tornado approaching just minutes or seconds, whatever, before it even actually hit the building. It was that loud. So you could hear it approaching. Yes, at that point they were crying. They were upset. They were scared. They were very scared. We just all knelt together and i put myself over their bodies and put my arms around them and just held them as tight as I could and just told them, you know, it's going to be okay. I said I promise. It's going to be okay. And we just kept like that until it had passed over and we looked up and the ceiling was gone. Cinder blocks were falling on us. Pieces of debris. It was horrifying. They were very frightened. 
[00:23:04]



>> At what point did you realize it was over? Well, for one thing when i turned around and looked up, you could see the whole entire sky. There was nothing left of the roof. And just the fact that a lot of debris flying around, the cinder blocks, everything had just kind of settled down and it got really, really quiet as far as the weather went. The children were still very, very upset. It just got very calm after it passed. 
>> How long have you been a teacher, theresa? 
>> I've been a teacher for 30 years. 
>> I got to say a lot of people in the country today are looking at this and reminded of the incredible work that you do. Personally and as a member of a profession. I just want to say thank you for what you did. 
>> Thank you. And we love those children. Love them very, very much. They are very, very brave.

>>> last night on this broadcast we brought you the interview of a man who survived the storm in their tornado shelter and emerged to find everything destroyed. 
>> My wife and I worked hard for everything we had. We just now paid off our house. We had no house payment. We were supposed to go tomorrow to sign papers on land to build a new house and that house was collateral for the land purchase so now we're in a position of which direction do we go? 
>> All together wondering what lies ahead for this man and his family? What lies ahead for thousands in moore, oklahoma? How do they begin to rebuild. I wonder about their insurance and what does it cover and whether private insurance in the face of catastrophic loss is enough. Joining me now is the oklahoma insurance commissioner. Thank you for joining us. I guess my first question is what is the general situation of folks living in tornado alley. Obviously the insurance industry, homeowners all know this is a possible risk. Is insurance required, are most of these folks insured and will they be made whole? 
>> Sure. Absolutely. If they have a mortgage, insurance would most likely be required. We've done an educational campaign over the last year in the state of oklahoma to educate folks on the need of insurance after oklahoma's wildfires last year. We found out there was a high percentage of our population in rural areas that did not have insurance and I think it's going to be much different in this case coming through a rural metro area. I think it will be substantially different and I think there will be thousands of claims here and we're going to do our best to make sure oklahomans understand their insurance policies from a consumer perspective and make sure insurance companies fulfill promises which they made to oklahomans and the industry has responded very, very well and we're going to work with them and we're coordinating that effort as we speak. 
>> You talk about making sure that the companies live up to their obligations. This shows the amount of severe storm related loss this is year not including the past week compared to the amount covered by insurance and you see 3.5 billion in total losses in 2 billion covered by insurance and the fear for a lot of folks standing amidst rubble there is about that gap between the two. 
[00:30:40]



>> Yes. That's going to be 
-- we're going to have to analyze that. The oklahoma insurance department. We have a very, very fine employee base and I want to say they responded overwhelmingly in the last 24 hours to help folks in the area. Our financial team is going to be on top of this looking at this from many, many different angles working with insurers and consumers to make sure their coverage was adequate but also sitting down with them individually one-on-one. We will be here as long as it takes and I have to say I'm proud to be a part of the national insurance commissioners because I've had them reach out from all the states to offer assistance. Many states. We're going to need their help but we're going to take care of consumers and we'll do the right thing. Just last week oklahoma governor mary fallin passed the oklahoma consumer bill of rights for home and auto. It's a law that codified some very important aspects of our title 36 for consumer protections and I'm very proud of that just passed last week. We're going to do our very best to take care of consurs. 
>> Let me make sure I'm clear here. When we saw situations in sandy and areas in flood plains, there are federal programs that act as sort of backstops and guarantees. What you're operating there with in moore is the private insurance market, right? We're not dealing with state or federal programs that have these folks insured because of the heightened risk for tornado. 
>> Absolutely. In oklahoma we strongly believe in market competition for companies and for consumers to be able to make that best choice to let their feet do the walking with insurance companies to put them in greater control. We're proud of that aspect. Behind the scenes we're very proud if we're watching the financial solvency of companies, the oklahoma property and casualty fund is backstop for oklahoma consumers and they've been there a long time and they've done a good job for companies that might become insolvent. Again, we believe in free market competition and the insurance companies that do business in the state of oklahoma really when they are competing for business for oklahomans on events like this, we know it's not a matter of if but when we're going to have this happen in oklahoma. 
[00:33:06]



>> The proof of that performance and results of that market competition come in the wake of disasters on the back end. Oklahoma insurance commissioner, thank you very much. Appreciate it. 
>> You're welcome. Thank you. 
>>> Coming up, I'll tell you how they were responding to the oklahoma disaster on capitol hill today and why another political fight over disaster relief is already brewing.

>>> While the nation's attention is focused on oklahoma, it was an active day on capitol hill including this breaking news on the most consequential piece of legislation facing the congress possibly one of the most consequential pieces of legislation in the obama era, immigration reform. The first major hurdle was cleared today. They voted to advance the bill to the full sete. The vote in the senate judiciary committee was not close. 13-5. Three republicans joined the panel's ten democrats to vote for the bill. In an emotional moment, patrick leahy of vermont announced he would not call for a vote on amendment that would have recognized marriages of same-sex spouses in immigration law. The measure will head to the senate floor without that amendment meaning no protection for same-sex spouses. mitch McConnell said he will not block the immigration proposal from being debated from the full senate. John boehner offered his condolences to people in moore ordering flags being flown at half-staff and then it was back to business as usual. 
>> Whether it's benghazi, irs, justice department investigating journalists, the congress of the united states and the american people need to know what the truth is to hold this administration accountable. Over on the senate side, the political conversation turned to how we pay for things like disaster relief which ultimately is through our taxes. The senate finance committee holding the first hearings on the targeting of conservative groups, commissioner steven miller of the irs got to spend his last day on the job getting grilled by a room full of lawmakers. Tim cook depended his company's tax practices before a senate subcommittee. A blockbuster report from that subcommittee found that apple holds billions of dollars offshore in irish subsidiaries to avoid paying little or no taxes to any government. Cook telling the committee we pay all of the taxes we owe, every single dollar. Senator rand paul taking a page out of the joe barton page book offered an apology to the giant for what he characterized as big government bullying. 
[00:39:04]



>> Frankly, I'm offended by the tone and tenor of this hearing. I'm offended by a $4 trillion government bullying, berating and badgering one of america's greatest success stories. If anyone should be on trial here, it should be congress. I frankly think the committee should apologize to apple. 
>> Meanwhile, senator john McCAIN TOOK THE OPPORTUNITY TO Turn the hearing into an impromptu genius bar appointment. 
>> I want to ask why I have to keep updating apps on my iphone all the time. Why don't you fix that? 
>> We're trying to make them better all the time. 
>> Amen, senator. The next political battle, the fight over disaster relief. Will the gop demand federal leaf money be upset by other spending cuts as they did initially for sandy? That's up next.

>> That was ly different. They had things in virgin islands and fixes roads there and put roofs on houses in washington d.C. Everybody was getting in and exporting the tragedy that took place. That won't happen in oklahoma. 
>> That was senator jim inhofe explaining differences between sandy aid and yet to be created aid that oklahoma will undoubtedly need to rebuild. His colleague from oklahoma, senator tom colburn said disaster aid funding must be offset by cuts in the budget elsewhere. Dr. Coburn will not change his position. There's a question about how disaster relief will function in a state with two senators who have been outspoken about denying disaster relief to other states in the very recent past. Let's bring in oklahoma state REPRESENTATIVE mark McBride who represents moore. With me in new york I have steve ellis from taxpayers for common sense. representative McBride, let me begin with you. What do you need there in moore? What are your expectations of what the federal government can provide to help you folks rebuild? 
[00:44:59]



>> You know, I don't really know. I was in a motorcade with our colleagues and senators from d.C. They all flew in today. I know that congressman cole had spoke with the president twice today and he assured him that he was going to take care of us and in what manner I'm not sure. That's on their level. I look to them for getting that aid for us. I know the president did declare five oklahoma counties. In oklahoma one of the things about oklahoma is we pull together. I can think of $10 million just in the last five or six hours that I know that was contributed by some different oil companies and different things so that's just the beginning. We'll step up to the plate and we like to take care of our own but we can also use that money plus the house passed a bill today. I wasn't able to get there today. 45 million out of our rainy day fund. 
>> Do you have expectations about how the senate delegation from oklahoma if confronted with a bill that doesn't offset the spending, how would that play among your constituents if senator coburn were to vote against an aid package that would help oklahoma because it wasn't offset? 
>> Like I said, I was just with them. I know that they're trying to get some funding in here, some federal money. It's federal aid and I just know the conversations I've had with them. I don't see them really voting against it. 
>> That will be exactly the interesting test because senator inhofe was comparing the sandy aid package. I want to say to folks watching this network that part of what he said about sandy aid package was true. It did have a lot of stuff in there. Some was mitigation projects which are reasonably included. It's very hard for me to imagine a situation in which the disaster bill that gets brought to the floor for this disaster doesn't have a lot of other stuff in it. 
[00:47:05]



>> It certainly has been the history. I would say that sandy because of some of the spending pressures and really much more robust argument for offsetting it had even less than I had seen in the past and I have been looking at disaster bills for well over a decade. I think that there's going to be a lot of pressure because these are part of the only pieces of legislation that actually move in congress. If yoon't can't a ride on disaster package, you may not get it. 
>> It's so dysfunctional that the budget control act imposed such intense austerity that if you have something you want funded, this is kind of your shot. 
>> Absolutely. If you look at just even the regular spending bills we did a continuing resolution for the majority of the spending bills so we extended 2012 levels. When you look at the senate budget and house budget, they're radically different. It's hard to see how they'll come together on any kind agreement. This becomes a natural vehicle and it's going to attract flies. 
>> STATE rep McBride, obviously you have rebuilt before in moore 14 years ago. How did that process work? I read something today about how you just got back to about the same level of housing units after the full net was counted for after the last round of destruction. How important a role did federal or state aid play in that rebuilding? 
>> Well, I wasn't here. I wasn't involved in that. My father was a builder and developer and he was involved in rebuilding moore. You know, you're asking me about something I just wasn't involved in. I wasn't here. I don't know how the federal money played out. You know, I heard you guys talking about some stuff hidden in the bills and everything. If you're going tom coburn is going to find anything like that and vote against it. We don't want anything. We don't want anything extra. We just want to rebuild our city and whatever they can do for us. They can cough up and whatever they don't, we'll make it up. That's the way we roll here. 
[00:49:12]



>> State representative mark McBRIDE OF OKLAHOMA, STEVE Ellis, stay with us. We'll be back with a congressman who went through the sandy funding battle after this.

>>> You may not think about disaster funding but as we live through the disaster age with more and more disasters to come, it will be more a part of our life. When we come back, more on disaster funding after this break. 
[00:52:47]



>> These kind of weather disasters are new in history and. They're predictable. It's not a question about whether but en a community is going to get hit. One of the reasons we try to be sympathetic to people in other parts of the country when they are happy to work for sandy relief. I talked to people from new york and I wish I hadn't said that. I was visiting with a representative of the governor, we'll always be there to help because we're one tornado away from being joplin. I didn't think it would be quite that soon. 
>> That's tom cole who represents the area struck by the tornado yesterday speaking to my colleague chris matthews. We're talking about disaster relief in the wake of moore, oklahoma. I want to bring in joakim jeffries. Congressman, I want to play for you this bit of sound from senator coburn or read this to you. Senator coburn saying it's insensitive to talk about offsets. It's insensitive to talk about it now showing crassness of washington versus sensitivity we need to have. What's your sense about whether offsets will be demanded on this and whether they should be? 
>> It's my hope that offsets won't be demanded. We went through this as it relates to superstorm sandy and it was highly problematic. The federal congressional response to disasters have got to be three things. They have to be swift. They have to be compassionate. And they've got to be thorough. As it relates to superstorm sandy the federal government was a day late and a dollar short. That was unfortunate. It set us back because of the offset discussion we weren't able to move forward on an expedited basis. We are hopeful on the democratic side of the aisle to make sure as it relates to this disaster we can get the relief necessary to the people in oklahoma as swiftly and thoroughly as possible to help them get through the recovery phase and then of course the rebuilding after the humanitarian issues have been dealt with. 
[00:54:57]



>> Steve, you track this stuff. Do you agree with the congressman. You are shaking your head a little bit. 
>> I don't agree that the delay had impact on the money that went on the ground. You have a disaster relief fund like we do now. It's $12 billion. 
>> Hold up right there. Explain to me. Every time you see this in your inbox or the president signed an emergency disaster declaration and oklahoma is the third highest number of disaster declaration after texas and california, what does that mean in real terms before we even get to congress? 
>> Basically you have the local government says we can't handle this it's so big. They go to the governor. The governor says I can't handle this it's too big and then they request the president make a major disaster declaration. Fema sifts through it because some are on the margin some are clear answers like this one. Exactly. And then the president makes the major disaster declaration and that's when federal funds start flowing. That's when money starts moving into the region and flows so there is $12 billion today in the disaster relief fund that's available for the president to start sending through fema to the area. Same thing happened with sandy. I just point out and I don't want to relitigate sandy or whatever. The president didn't even request any money, didn't submit any requests to the congress until early december more than a month after the disaster happened because there is this money available. 
>> Congressman, was the money flowing quick enough, fast enough and getting into the right hands in the wake of sandy because the president signed that declaration? 
>> Well, the big issue, chris, was the fact that the national flood insurance program had run out of money so there were claims that had been filed and people legitimate policy holders who were seeking relief based on the policies they held but fema made clear there wasn't sufficient funding to process existing claims and those that would be anticipated. That created a backlog. That created complications on the ground. It's inaccurate to say the delay did not have complications. It had real complications for the people I represent in communities like coney island and manhattan beach and howard beach that weren't impacted by the storm. 
[00:57:19]



>> Just to get to the point though about in this context and there was money that went on flood insurance separately ahead of sandy. As we get to this discussion of offsets whether there will be delay because of delay over offsets. There is money and there have been aments about offsets over the year. Only one disaster bill, the investigative arm of congress that has actually been offset. It was actually after oklahoma in 1995. 
>> That's an amazing detail. Here's what I want to get to you, congressman and steve, we've talked about this. Billions of dollars from damages from extreme weather events that are becoming more frequent. Paul douglas says we don't have science to link tornado severity to climate but you can see we're going up. We're seeing more disasters. We're seeing more expensive tornadoes because of building in areas that formerly were rural. What should we be doing differently with our disaster relief? 
>> We should be spending more money when we don't have a disaster to try to mitigate and to move people out of harm's way and encourage that. We should reorientate our disaster warning systems that incentivize states to have relief funds. The more you have in building codes and more you have in things that will help you out and also help the taxpayers out that we're not bearing as much of the burden. Those type of changes would actually have a really big impact and would make those disaster relief dollars go farther. 
>> Steve ellis of taxpayers for common sense and congressman hakeem jeffries, thank you very much. Really appreciate it. 
>> Thank you.

>>> 
>>> good evening. From new york I'm chris hayes. We know more about the path of the tornado that devastated this community and the scope of the damage visited upon this town and we know more tonight of the amazing acts of courage by teachers and the two schools crushed by the storm. The good news today and it's nice to report good news, initial reports of fatalities have for now been cut in half. The medical examiner having placed the number of dead at 51, this morning revised that number to 24 confirmed deaths. A spokesman explained some victims were counted twice in the chaos. The monster storm had has been now calculated at ef-5. Its force is estimated to have been 600 times greater than that of the atomic bomb that exploded in hiroshima. It touched down just 16 minutes after the first siren was sounded. Just four minutes later it had reached category 4. The track was eerily similar to the 1999 tornado that struck the area. As we see this time lapsed video of the tornado's progression, it was on the ground for 17 miles, creating a path of carrage that was at its greatest 2.3 miles wide. 237 people are reported injured, including 70 children and 34,000 pele have lost power in moore, oklahoma city and other affected areas. At the plaza towers elementary school, the search for survivors continued today. Oklahoma's governor mary fallin made an on-site tour. 
[00:02:13]



>> It was surreal coming upon the school because there was no school. There was just debris. And it was piled very high. It was hard to tell what was there. 
>> Fema director craig furgate said search and rescue will continue until everyone is found and reports of neighbors helping neighbor are already pouring in. 
>> We pulled a lot of people out. A will the of them are elderly people. We pulled some younger people out, too. Some didn't make it, some did or most of them did that we were involved in. I kicked a door in to save this one elderly lady and her grand kids and stuff and she had just gotten inside the house when it hit. She was still in the living room, the whole living room was just obliterated. I don't know how she made it but she did, thank god. 
>> President obama having last night declared a state of emergency in oklahoma today said oklahoma will get everything it needs. 
>> The people of moore should know that their country will remain on the ground, there for them, beside them, as long as it takes. 
>> Today also produced as it would in the age of instant iwitness videos more ivideos of the storm. The state emergency operation center remains activated. Joining me right now from moore, oklahoma, msnbc's thomas roberts. I see folks in the background. We've been seeing them all day. What are people doing in the aftermath? Are they returning to their homes? Are they out of the area? What are folks trying to could 
-- do today on the day after? 
>> It's a contradiction here in oak okay because the evening is absolutely perfect. As we look around, it's complete devastation. A little after 24 hours nou we know that that tornado is categorized as an ef-5. There's a young couple who rode out the storm in their bath tub. That's amber, the blond, behind me. She's talking about the bath tub, which is right to the right-hand side of that toilet, if you can make that out over my shoulder. She was in that bath tub with her husband, nathan and her three little kids. They have two 4-year-old twins, one 6-year-old daughter. They she said they got in the bath tub with the kids, covered with couch pillos and put a blanket over that. They emermged completely unscathed and they claimed out and went on to family. Earlier today it was rainey and very windy. Some people did come out to survey the damage early on and then it got a little worse where people just fled. Now in the evening hours it gotten really nice. We've been here all day. This is the first time we've seen nathan and amber come back. Lots of people have come back along this street as well. For amber, she's trying to find something for her 6-year-old daughter that can claim as a memento. Her twins walked away with their blankets. Her daughter was at the plaza towers school but she went to the early classes and her mom had already picked her up. We asked if she was aware of any of her friends that may have perished and she's not. They say seven plus students may have died there. You had brought up the tally in and of itself. They had brought that number, the earlier reports were much higher, but it does remain at 2424/right now. As we break down that number, it 20 people in oklahoma city 
-- excuse me, 20 people in moore, 4 people in oklahoma city and 9 of the victims are children. The first victim identified is a little 9-year-old girl, a student at plaza tourers elementary school. It really is devastating. I had an opportunity to walk around the neighborhood and talk to everybody. They're so grateful they have their loved ones and they were able to walk away mostly unscathed. It is heartbreaking to see people coming back. Amber, I asked her, they were homeowners here for the last 12 years. We asked if she wanted to rebuild. She said she doesn't know. She just knows wherever she does rebuild, she wants a basement. 
[00:07:06]



>> And bring that bath tub. 
>> Great minds think alike. I asked her about the bath tub, if she would take it to the new house and she said she might. 
>> That's a keeper. Yesterday's massive tornado was officially categorized as an f-5 in at least one area. Joining me to put that in perspective and demonstrate the strength is paul douglas, founder of weather nation tv. Here's my question, paul. This question is of aerson who is not a meteorologist and doesn't quite necessarily really understand in a deep way how a tornado works. I do not 
-- I just genuinely don't understand the images of destruction that I'm seeing. You can look at hurricanes going through areas and floods and actually we've been covering disasters a lot because we live in a disaster-prone age. But I can't get my head around how the conditions are produced that create a storm powerful enough to do the thing that we are all now watching the aftermath of. 
>> It's a great question, chris. And there is a disconnect. The united states is ground zero for tornadoes. 90% of all twisters worldwide form here. The same attributes that make our nation so beautiful, the geographical features, disparities, the contrast, also can conjure up this witch's brew of meteorologistogical ingredients. It's like predicting a sneeze. They're atmospheric hiccups. We can tell when conditions are right but trying to predict where one will touch down and what the ultimate intensity will be is fraught with peril. We're not there yet. A tornado isn't so much an object as it is a process, one that takes many hours to unfold. And we have an animation explaining the dynamics involved. Of course you need moisture from the gulf of mexico, but overlaid in the mid layers of the atmosphere, you need dry, cool air. Those conditions usually converge over the plain states traditional tornado alley or even dixie alley, east of the mississippi. We're seeing an eastward trend to some of the most severe tornadoes. The winds increase as you rise through the atmosphere. This creates horizontal wind sheer, think of it as horizontal tubes of air. When you have a thunderstorm, an intense updraft that, thunderstorm is able to focus the horizontal sheer about a veical axis. And like an ice skater who brings her arms in and spins faster, you have all this moisture and energy being focused around this vertical axis. In a typical thunderstorm, it usually snuffs itself out within about 30 to 45 minutes, but in these super cell thunderstorms, they tilt over slightly due to wind changes. So instead of dying out after 45 minutes, it goes on hour after hour and you have enormous amounts of energy focusing right around the central core. And a rear flank down draft pulls this whole circulation down to the ground and we have a tornado. Out of a hundred thunderstorms, chris, maybe one or two will ever go on to produce a tornado. That's the good news. They are exceedingly rare. The odds of seeing an f-5 probably comrable to winning the powerball lotto. The fact that moore has seen major tornadoes since 1999 is unheard of. But oklahoma is the heart of tornado alley. THEY'VE HAD 13 EF-5s JUST SINCE 1902 in the state of oklahoma. Oklahomans are incredibly tornado aware, they know what to do. My nightmare scenario is what if certainly like that hits in nashville, chicago, atlanta or washington d.C. There was an ef-3 tornado that hit in maryland. Yes, tornado alley sees the most on dose but we're seeing an apparent eastward shift from dixie alley and even hoosier alley. We don't know if that's a manifestation of climate change, as we discussed yesterday. No sound science yet that a warmer atmosphere necessarily means more severe tornadoes. Yes, it does mean more instability, there's more water vapor, more fuel for these severe thunderstorms. But in a warmer atmosphere, you should have less wind sheer and that would tend to negate some of these other factors. You can't connect the dot, there's no causal connection, but it's something we're going to be watching very carefully. 
[00:12:24]



>> That was really a satisfying explanation. The image of my head is this sort of pitching on its axis situation there. That I think I can get my head around. Paul douglas, thank you very much. 
>> Thank you, chris. 
>> Amidst of rubble today, the inspiring story of the teachers who shielded their students from danger. 
>> This is incredible footage outside briarwood elementary school just minutes after the tornado struck. We'll talk to a teacher to planned to lay down her life to make sure her students survived. We'll be right back. people thing only... And those people are what I like to call...Wrong.

>> That very emotional reunion happened yesterday as parents showed up at the sites of demolished elementary schools in oklahoma hoping toind their children alive. Today justified praise is heaped on the teachers who protected the lives of these children. I'll speak with a fourth grade teacher who gave no second thought to putting her life on the line. That's next. ?????? ??????

>>> Our prayers are withhe people of oklahoma today. Our gratitude is with the teachers who gave their all to shield their children with the neighbors, first responders and emergency personnel who raced to help as soon as the tornado passed andith all of those who as darkness fell searched for survivors through the night. 
[00:18:27]



>> That was president obama this morning acknowledging the courageous efforts of rescue workers and ordinary citizens most notably the teachers. Plaza towers elementary school and briarwood elementary school. Oklahoma officials do not know how many students were in the two elementary schools when they suffered a direct hit from the storm. All of the students at briarwood have been accounted for. However, at least seven children at plaza towers elementary were killed. Both schools were reduced to rubble and according to oklahoma officials neither school had safe rooms for students and teachers to take shelter. Nor did the schools have basements. A second grade teacher at briarwood elementary was with seven children when the ceiling collapsed pinning them to the ground. She survived and said her thoughts were on children and keeping them calm. At a nearby day care center, a staff hustled 15 children to two bathrooms draping them with a protective covering and singing songs to keep them calm as the wind ripped the roof off and they remained calm singing "you are my sunshine." Maybe the most remarkable story comes from plaza towers elementary where a teacher put herself directly between the kids and the storm. 
>> I was in a stall with some kids. It started coming down. I laid on top of them. One of my little boys kept saying I love you. Please don't die with me. I never thought I was going to die. The whole time I just kept screaming to them, quit worrying. We're fine. We're fine. We're fine. 
>> Joining me now is theresa mostier, a fourth agreed teacher at briarwood elementary school. I'm so glad that you are safe and thank you very much for joining us. Can you walk us through what that day was like and at what point you knew a torna was headed your way and what the teachers in the school did and what you did. 
>> It was a pretty normal day until the afternoon. We knew that we were going to have thunderstorms but it wasn't until the afternoon that we started to realize that they were getting severe and we noticed that the children were starting to be checked out by some of the parents. Later on our administrator came across the intercom and told us that we were to start taking tornado precautionary measures and that it was not a drill so that's when we immediately started taking our children and getting them against the wall and going into our precautionary tornado measures. 
[00:20:57]



>> What are those measures? Obviously you drill on them there because tornadoes are common there. What exactly did you do with the students you had? 
>> We're kind of in a different type of building. We don't have hallways. We have pods. So all we have are inside walls so we get our children up against the inside wall and have them get down on their knees and lower their heads and put their arms over their head and just stay in that positn until, you know, up until then it just had been until a drill was over. That's what we do. 
>> So you have your fourth graders, I believe, against the wall and they are down. Are they freaking out? Are they scared? Did they recognize what's coming? 
>> Yes. You could hear the tornado approaching just minutes or seconds, whatever, before it even actually hit the building. It was that loud. So you could hear it approaching. Yes, at that point they were crying. They were upset. They were scared. They were very scared. We just all knelt together and i put myself over their bodies and put my arms around them and just held them as tight as I could and just told them, you know, it's going to be okay. I said I promise. It's going to be okay. And we just kept like that until it had passed over and we looked up and the ceiling was gone. Cinder blocks were fallin us. Pieces of debris. It was horrifying. They were very frightened. 
>> At what point did you realize it was over? Well, for one thing when i turned around and looked up, you could see the whole entire sky. There was nothing left of the roof. And just the fact that a lot of debris flying around, the cinder blocks, everything had just kind of settled down and it got really, really quiet as far as the weather went. The children were still very, very upset. It just got very calm after it passed. 
[00:23:31]



>> How long have you been a teacher, theresa? 
>> I've been a teacher for 30 years. 
>> I got to say a lot of people in the country today are looking at this and reminded of the incredible work that you do. Personally and as a member of a profession. I just want to say thank you for what you did. 
>> Thank you. And we love those children. Love them very, very much. They are very, very brave. 
>> It really shows. Theresa mosier, teacher at briarwood elementary school who survived the storm with her fourth grade class huddled up against an interior wall as the tornado ripped the roof off. Thank you for joining us tonight. 
>> Thank you.

>>> last night on this broadcast we brought you the interview of a man who survived the storm I in their tornado shelter and emerged to find everything destroyed. 
>> My wife and I worked hard for everything we had. We just now paid off our house. We had no house payment. We were supposed to go tomorrow to sign papers on land to build a new house and that house was collateral for the land purchase so now we're in a position of which direction do we go? 
>> Staff all together wondering what lies ahead for this man and his family? What lies ahead for thousands in moore, oklahoma? How do they begin to rebuild. I wonder about their insurance and what does it cover and whether private insurance in the face of catastrophic loss is enough. Joining me now is the oklahoma insurance commissioner. Thank you for joining us. I guess my first question is what is the general situation of folks living in tornado alley? Obviously the insurance industry, homeowners all know this is a possible risk. Is insurance required, are most of these folks insured and will they be made whole? 
>> Sure. Absolutely. If they have a mortgage, insurance would most likely be required. We've done an educational campaign over the last year in the state of oklahoma to educate folks on the need of insurance after oklahoma's wildfires last year. We found out there was a high percentage of our population in rural areas that did not have insurance and I think it's going to be much different in this case coming through a rural metro area. I think it will be substantially different and I think there will be thousands of claims here and we're going to do our best to make sure oklahomans understand their insurance policies from a consumer perspective and make sure insurance compaes fulfill promises which they made to oklahomans. And the industry has responded very, very well and we're going to work with them and we're coordinating that effort as we speak. 
>> You talk about making sure that the companies live up to their obligations. This shows the amount of severe storm related losses this year not including the past week compared to the amount covered by insurance and you see 3.5 billion in total losses in 2 billion covered by insurance and the fear for a lot of folks standing amidst rubble there is about that gap between the two. 
[00:30:27]



>> Yes. That's going to be 
-- we're going to have to analyze that. The oklahoma insurance department. We have a very, very fine employee base and I want to say they responded overwhelmingly in the last 24 hours to help folks in the area. Our financial team is going to be on top of this looking at this from many, many different angles, working with insurers and consumers to make sure their coverage was adequate but also sitting down with individually one-on-one. We will be here as long as it takes and I have to say I'm proud to be a part of the national insurance commissioners because I've had commissioners reach out from all the states to offer assistance. Many states. We're going to need their help but we're going to take care of consumers and we'll do the right thing. Just last week oklahoma governor mary fallin passed the oklahoma consumer bill of rights for home and auto. It's a law that codified some very important aspects of our title 36 for consumer protections and I'm very proud of that just passed last week. We're going to do our very best to take care of consumers. 
>> Let me make sure I'm clear here. When we've seen situations in sandy and areas in flood plains, there are federal programs that act as sort of backstops and guarantees. What you're operating there with in moore is the private insurance market, right? We're not dealing with state or federal programs that have these folks insured because of the heightened risk for tornado. 
>> Absolutely. In oklahoma we strongly believe in market competition for companies and for consumers to be able to make that best choice to let their feet do the walking with insurance companies to put them in greater control. We're proud of that aspect. Behind the scenes we're very proud if we're watching the financial solvency of companies, the oklahoma property and casualty fund is backstop for oklahoma consumers and they've been there a long time and they've done a good job for companies that might become insolvent. Again, we believe in free market competition and the insurance companies that do business in the state of oklahoma really when they are competing for business for oklahomans on events like this, we know it's not a ma of if but when we're going to have this happen in oklahoma. 
[00:32:51]



>> The proof of that performance and results of that market competition come in the wake of disasters on the back end. Oklahoma insurance commissioner, thank you very much. Appreciate it. 
>> You're welcome. Thank you. 
>>> Coming up, I'll tell you how they were responding to the oklahoma disaster on capitol hill today and why another political fight over disaster relief is already brewing. We'll be right back. But there are some things I've never seen before. This ge jet engine can understand 5,000 data samples per second. Which is good for business.

>>> While the nation's attention is focused on oklahoma, it was an active day on capitol hill including this breaking news on the most consequential piece of legislation facing the congress possibly one of the most consequential pieces of legislation in the obama era, immigration reform. The first major hurdle was cleared today. The 18-member committee charged with completing the ed it's voted to send the bill to the full senate. The vote in the senate judiciary committee was not close. 13-5. Three republicans joined the panel's ten democrats to vote for the bill. In an emotional moment, patrick leahy of vermont announced he would not call for a vote on amendment that would have recognized marriages of same-sex spouses in immigration law. The measure will head to the senate floor without that amendment meaning no protection for same-sex spouses. On tuesday minority leader mitch McConnell said he will not block the immigration proposal from being debated from the full senate. John boehner offered his condolences to people in moore ordering flags being flown at half-staff and then it was back to business as usual. 
>> Whether it's benghazi, irs, justice department investigating journalists, the congress of the united states and the american people need to know what the truth is to hold this administration accountable. 
[00:38:11]



>> Over on the senate side, the political conversation turned to how we pay for things like disaster relief which ultimately is through our taxes. The senate finance committee holding the first hearings on the targeting of conservative groups, commissioner steven miller of the irs got to spend his last day on the job getting grilled by a room full of lawmakers. Tim cook depended his company's tax practices before a senate subcommittee. A blockbuster report from that subcommittee found that apple holds billions of dollars offshore in irish subsidiaries to avoid paying little or no taxes to any government. Cook telling the committee we pay all of the taxes we owe, every single dollar. That is precisely the problem. Senator rand paul taking a page out of the joe barton page book offered an apology to the giant for what he characterized as big government bullying. 
>> Frankly, I'm offended by the tone and tenor of this hearing. I'm offended by a $4 trillion government bullying, berating and badgering one of america's greatest success stories. If anyone should be on trial here, it should be congress. I frankly think the committee should apologize to apple. 
>> Meanwhile, senator john McCAIN TOOK THE OPPORTUNITY TO Turn the hearing into an impromptu genius bar appointment. 
>> I want to ask why I have to keep updating apps on my iphone all the time. Why don't you fix that? 
>> We're trying to make them better all the time. 
>> Amen, senator. The next political battle, the fight over disaster relief. Will the gop demand federal relief money be upset by other spending cuts as they did initially for sandy? That's up next. never before and didn't know where to start. At angie's list, you'll find reviews on everything from home repair to healthcare written by people just like you.

>> That was totally different. They had things in virgin islands and fixes roads there and put roofs on houses in washington d.C. Everybody was getting in and exporting the tragedy that took place. That won't happen in oklahoma. 
>> That was senator jim inhofe who voted against a bill to provide aid for hurricane sandy disaster relief, explaining differences between sandy aid and yet to be created aid that oklahoma will undoubtedly need to rebuild. His colleague from oklahoma, senator tom coburn said disaster aid funding must be offset by cuts in the budget elsewhere. His office said if an additional emergency aid package is necessary, dr. Coburn will not ge his position. There's a question about how disaster relief will function in a state with two senators who have been outspoken about denying disaster relief to other states in the very recent past. Let's bring in oklahoma state REPRESENTATIVE mark McBride who represents moore. With me in new york I have steve ellis from taxpayers for common sense. representative McBride, let me begin with you. What do you need there in moore? What are your expectations of what the federal government can provide to help you folks rebuild? 
>> You know, I don't really know. I was in a motorcade with our congressmen and senators from d.C. They all flew in today. I know tt congressman cole had spoke with the president twice today and he assured him that he was going to take care of us and in what manner I'm not sure. That's on their level. I look to them for getting that aid for us. I know the president did declare five oklahoma counties. In oklahoma one of the things about oklahoma is we pull together. I can think of $10 million just in the last five or six hours that I know that was contributed by some different oil companies and different things. So that's just the beginning. We'll step up to the plate and we like to take care of our own but we can also use that money plus the house passed a bill today. I wasn't able to get there today. 45 million out of our rainy day fund. 
[00:45:41]



>> Do you have expectations about how the senate delegation from oklahoma if confronted with a bill that doesn't offset the spending, how would that play among your constituents if senator coburn were to vote against an aid package that would help oklahoma because it wasn't offset? 
>> Like I said, I was just with them. I know that they're trying to get some funding in here, some federal money. It's federal aid and I just know the conversations I've had with them. I don't see them really voting against it. 
>> That will be exactly the interesting test because senator inhofe was comparing the sandy aid package. I want to say to folks watching this network that part of what he said about sandy aid package was true. It did have a lot of stuff in there. Some was mitigation projects which are reasonably included. Some of it a little less germane to the disaster relief. It's very hard for me to imagine a situation in which the disaster bill that gets brought to the floor for this disaster doesn't have a lot of other stuff in it. 
>> It certainly has been the history. I would say that sandy because of some of the spending pressures and really much more robust argument for offsetting it had even less than I had seen in the past and I have been looking at disaster bills for well over a decade. I think that there's going to be a lot of pressure because these are part of the only pieces of legislation that actually move in congress. If you don't can't a ride on this disaster aid, you might not have anything to catch a ride on the rest of congress. 
>> You made the point to me that the congress is so dysfunctional, that the budget control act imposed such intense austerity that if you have something you want funded, this is kind of your one shot. 
[00:47:49]



>> Absolutely. If you look at just even the regular spending bills we did a continuing resolution for the majority of the spending bills so we extended 2012 levels. When you look at the senate budget and house budget, they're radically different. It's hard to see how they'll come together on any kind agreement. This becomes a natural vehicle and it's going to attract flies. 
>> STATE rep McBride, obviously you have rebuilt before in moore 14 years ago. How did that process work? I read something today about how you just got back to about the same level of housing units after the full net was counted for after the last round of destruction. How important a role did federal or state aid play in that rebuilding? 
>> Well, I wasn't here. I wasn't involved in that. My father was a builder and developer, and he was involved in rebuilding moore. You know, you're asking me about something I just wasn't involved in. I wasn't here. I don't know how the federal money played out. You know, I heard you guys talking about some stuff hidden in the bills and everything. If you're going 
-- tom coburn is going to find anything like that and vote against it. We don't want anything. We don't want anything extra. We just want to rebuild our city and whatever they can do for us. They can cough up and whatever they don't, we'll make it up. That's the way we roll here. 
>> State representative mark McBRIDE OF OKLAHOMA, STEVE Ellis, stay with us. We'll be right back with congressman jefferies who went through that sandy funding so we e could headad back to thehe dealershihip.

>> These kind of weather disasters are new in history and. They're predictable. It's not a question about whether but when a community is going to get hit. One of the reasons we try to be sympathetic to people in other parts of the country when they are happy to work for sandy relief, for instance, and I was talking to people from newew york. And I almost wish I hadn't said this. I was visiting with a representative of the governor, we'll always be there to help because we're one tornado away from being joplin. I didn't think it would be quite that soon. 
>> That's tom cole who represents the area struck by the tornado yesterday speaking to my colleague chris matthews. We're talking about disaster relief in the wake of moore, oklahoma. I want to bring in hakeem jeffries. Congressman, I want to play for you this bit of sound from psenator coburn or read this to you. Senator coburn saying it's insensitive to talk about offsets. It's insensitive to talk about it now showing crassness of washington versus sensitivity we need to have. What's your sense about whether offsets will be demanded on this and whether they should be? 
>> It's my hope that offsets won't be demanded. We went through is as it relates to superstorm sandy and it was highly problematic. The federal congressional response to disasters have got to be three things. They have to be swift. They have to be compassionate. And they've got to be thorough. As it relates to superstorm sandy the federal government was a day late and a dollar short. That was unfortunate. It set us back because of the offset discussion we weren't able to move forward on an expedited basis. We are hopeful on the democratic side of the aisle to make sure as it relates to this disaster we can get the relief necessary to the people in oklahoma as swiftly and thoroughly as possible to help them get through the recovery phase and then of course the rebuilding after the humanitarian issues have been dealt with. 
[00:54:37]



>> Steve, you track this stuff. Do you agree with the congressman. You are shaking your head a little bit. 
>> I don't agree that the delay had impact on the money that went on the ground. You have a disaster relief fund like we do now. It's $12 billion. 
>> Hold up right there. Explain to me. Every time you see this in your inbox or the president signed an emergency disaster declaration and oklahoma is the third highest number of disaster declaration after texas and california, what does that mean in real terms before we even get to congress? 
>> Basically you have the local government says we can't handle this it's so big. They go to the governor. The governor says I can't handle this it's too big and then they request the president make a major disaster declaration. Fema sifts through it because some are on the margin some are clear answers like this one. Exactly. And then the president makes the major disaster declaration and that's when federal funds start flowing. That's when money starts moving into the region and flows so there is $12 billion today in the disaster relief fund that's available for the esident to start sending through fema to the area. Same thing hned with sandy. I just point out and I don't want to relitigate sandy or whatever. The president didn't even request any money, didn't submit any requests to the congress until early december more than a month after the disaster happened because there is this money available. 
>> Congressman, was the money flowing quick enough, fast enough and getting into the right hands in the wake of sandy because the president signed that declaration? 
>> Well, the big issue, chris, was the fact that the national flood insurance program had run out of money so there were claims that had been filed and people legitimate policy holders who were seeking relief based on the policies they held but fema made clear there wasn't sufficient funding to process existing claims and those that would be anticipated. That created a backlog. That created complications on the ground. It's inaccurate to say the delay did not have complications. It had real complications for the people I represent in communities like coney island and manhattan beach and howard beach that weren't impacted by the storm. 
[00:56:58]



>> Just to get to the point though about in this context and there was money that went on flood insurance separately ahead of sandy. As we get to this discussion of offsets whether there will be delay because of delay over offsets. There is money and there have been arguments about offsets over the year. Only one disaster bill, the investigative arm of congress that has actually been offset. It was actually after oklahoma in 1995. 
>> That's an amazing detail. Here's what I want to get to you, congressman and steve, we've talked about this. Billions of dollars from damages from extreme weather events that are becoming more frequent. Paul douglas says we don't have science to link tornado severity to climate but you can see we're going up. We're seeing more disasters. We're seeing more expensive tornadoes because of building in areas that formerly were rural. What should we be doing differently with our disaster relief? 
>> We should be spending more money when we don't have a disaster to try to mitigate and to move people out of harm's way and to encourage that. We should reorientate our disaster warning systems that incentivize states to have relief funds. The more you have in building codes and more you have in things that will help you out and also help the taxpayers out that we're not bearing as much of the burden. Those type of changes would actually have a really big impact and would make those disaster relief dollars go farther. 
>> Steve ellis of taxpayers for common sense and congressman hakeem jeffries, thank you very much. Really appreciate it. 
>> Thank you. 
>>> A final note with some more breaking news from moore, oklahoma, tonight. Nbc news confirmed the names of two of the victims of yesterday's tornado. The body of a 65 year old was recovered today. He became separated from his wife when the tornado struck their home and his family tells nbc news his wife survived and earlier today nbcnews.Com confirmed the death of a 9-year-old girl. She was found in the plaza towers elementary school. That is "all in" for this evening. The rachel maddow show starts now. 
[00:59:26]



>> Evening chris. Thank you. It's been a long hard day in the suburbs of oklahoma city. The confirmed death toll for yesterday's massive tornado in moore, oklahoma, is 24 and nine of those victims are children. The reason for the smaller death toll compared to what we were told last night is that authorities say many of the victims were inadvertently counted twice last night in the chaos of the tornado's immediate aftermath. Even with the lower number today, authorities are still cautioning they expect the overall death toll may still

>> Megyn: Alert on jodi aira, moments ago the woman of convicted of fatally stabbing, shooting, and nearly decapitating her boyfriend, took the stand in the penalty phase of her murder trial. When she was convicted, she suggested to a local reporter she would prefer the death penalty over life in prison. Seems she has had a change of heart. 
>> I didn't know then that if i got life instead of death i could become employed, self-reliant. I didn't know if I not life there are many things I can do to effectositive change. And contribute in a meaningful way. In prison there are programs i can start and people I can help, and programs I can participate in. 
>> Megyn: Adam housely has a live update for us. 
>> The moment everybody has been waiting for since the conviction, what would jodi arias say? She spent 20 minutes talking directly to the jury, showing pictures of her childhood, her family, her oil paintings, saying she didn't have a proper perspective when she told some people in interviews she would ref heart 
-- rather have death. She felt she could do something for society, though she never did admit to killing travis alex. In the said she immediate a horrible mistake and apologized to his family, and still insinuated domestic abuse. So if you didn't know she lied so many times in the past you might think it was pretty good statement. But all that is up next now is lunch and closing arguments and then instructions from the judge, and then they'll decide whether she gets life or death.

Devastat is here, and how much need there is and to go to cnn.Com/impact to help out if you can. 
>> Chris, thank you very much. We hope people do that. Of course, you will see chris' full tour tomorrow morning on "starting point." Now, more continuing coverage of the devastating tornado continues with "ac 360." 
>>> Good evening, everyone. We are at the end of a searing day standing in a neighborhood that is almost unrecognizable. We've seen parents and children reunited today. We've also met parents who have gotten the worst news possible. We have seen heroes emerge, neighbors and strangers alike rising to the occasion. You will meet some of them tonight. We begin, though, with the very latest information for you. The search for survivors and victims continues tonight. Crews with dogs have been going block by block all day checking, recheck and checking a third time. More than 100 people have been rescued alive from the rubble. They have been covering a lot of devastation. We learned late today that the tornado was as powerful as they come, an ef-5 storm with winds topping 200 miles an hour. It stayed on the ground for 17 miles, damaged 
-- you can certainly see the damage for yourself. House after house destroyed, a hospital damaged, movie theaters, stores, a bowling alley, all torn up. A state insurance official estimates the claims could top $1 billion. The cost in lives so far, 24, including nine kids. Many at plaza towers elementary school. This is video from late last night when the toll was considerably higher because local authorities mistakenly counted some of the fatalities twice. Still, a sobering number, 24 killed, several hundred injured, lives forever torn apart. President obama spoke today of the loss. 
>> There are empty spaces where there used to be living rooms and bedrooms and classrooms, and in time, we're going to need to refill those spaces with love and laughter and community. 
>> President obama said oklahoma needs to get everything it needs right away to recover and pledged to do all he can to make that happen. And even as the search and recovery goes on, we keep getting new and incredible pictures of the brutal storm, including home video taken from a storm cellar as the funnel cloud goes directly overhead, about ten seconds in you'll see a car tire go by. Watch. 
[00:03:03]



>> Charles gaffert shot that video and tells the story behind it later in the program. You'll meet him. First one of the most incredible stories to emerge from this disaster begins outside briarwood elementary school. Shortly after the storm as frantic parents searched for their kids. We want you to watch this to understand what it was like for parents, what they were going through yesterday in that school parking lot. 
>> Justin? 
>> All fifth graders right here! 
>> Watch out for the wires! 
>> Fifth graders! 
>> Hey, where is she? 
>> That last reunion you saw was trenda, her son camden and his teacher, who join me now live. It is so good to have you all here and doing so well. How are you holding up? 
>> Thank you. I'm doing great. I'm happy and pleased as punch with this lady right here because I think that she had an integral part in saving all the kids in her room. It was a miracle that kids walked out alive of that building. 
>> Teachers do an incredible job every day of the year, all around this country, but what happened here yesterday, the heroism shown, so many teachers. Explain what you did when you knew this storm was coming. 
>> Well, a friend sent me on her ipad what she thought it was coming, so I just got all the desks and I told the kids that we were going to play worms and so I made tunnels and I put all the desks on the wall and I said okay, we're going to get our musical instruments and we're going to play worms, so I told them to get underneath the desks and I put them two by two and i said okay, we're going to play our musical instruments and we're going to play worms and we're going to play as loud as we can, so I didn't want them to hear the roar. 
[00:05:04]



>> That's why you wanted the musical instruments to kind of drown out the sound 
-- 
>> I didn't want them to know what was going to happen. So we got under the desk two by two and my aide on the other side, she got on one side and put her body in half and I put my body on the other half, and we started playing the instruments and as we started singing "jesus loves me" and we started playing really loud and singing "jesus loves me" and i told them to sing as loud as they could and if they got scared they could scream but sing as loud as they could. So that's what we did. I said when you get scared, you can scream but keep playing, keep playing, keep playing. And we did it. And when it was all over, the kids told me that they thought the water fountain was leaking. 
>> That's what they thought, the water fountain was leaking. 
>> I said yeah, that might be rain. Then they were so brave and this little boy didn't cry at all. He just goes what are we 
-- he goes 
-- I said there might be heroes coming. One of them goes 
-- I forget one one. Do you know which one said what kind of heroes? Do you remember? 
>> Were you scared? Little bit? 
>> Um-hum. 
>> Could you hear the storm, above the sound of the music? 
>> We could hear. It was so loud. But the kids just kept on, they were so brave. This little one, he didn't cry at all. He was just playing his music and he was the bravest little boy ever, ever. Then after it came, I said guys, you're going to have to start playing your music loud so they hear us. So they just kept playing their little instruments that I had, and then finally, these people off the street just came and rescued us. 
>> What was the condition of the classroom afterward? 
>> Well, we didn't know because we were underneath the desks. 
>> Okay. 
>> And then the people came, these men off the streets came and they pulled us out and camden and them got out first, and then we were 
-- I was stuck and then we got out and they went one way from the classroom and I went another. 
[00:07:09]



>> You had a head injury. 
>> Yeah. But I didn't 
-- I just remember I got hit when I got out, when i was getting out. 
>> And the video of you, you had actually been going to a couple locations to try to find camden. 
>> I had. I had. I walked a mile, maybe. I was told he was at one location, I went there. He wasn't there. So then I had to go to another location and then that's when i found him and praise god that he was alive. 
>> You don't know, all our teachers were so brave. It wasn't just 
-- it was our kids following directions. They were the bravest. They were the heroes because they listened to all the teachers. 
>> Had you done drills on this before? 
>> We practice every month 
-- 
>> y practice the worm? 
>> We practice fire drills. 
>> Okay. So you just came up with the idea of doing the worm. 
>> Yeah. We practice fire drills every month because that's a guideline and we practice safety procedures, that's, you know, that's in the rules of the school. But the kids, we always tell them how important it is to follow safety procedures, and the kids were so good. 
>> Camden, could you hear the storm or were you just hearing your music? 
>> The storm. 
>> Yeah? And what was it like afterward? Were the desks all on top of you? 
>> No. The desk was in front of us. The roof was on top of the desk. 
>> And everybody at school was okay? That's just such an incredible blessing. That must have been the most incredible hug when you saw him for the first time. 
>> It was. It was but not only was I so happy just to see him, I was praising her because I just feel that she helped keep him safe. 
>> Yeah. Well, there's no doubt about it. Thank you so much for talking to us. I'm just so glad things worked out for you. Stay strong. I hope your head's okay. 
>> Yes. Thank you for all the teachers and for all the kids that just followed directions. 
>> That's great. Thank you so much. Good luck. As we said at the top, survey crews today took a look at the destruction, put this tornado at an ef-5. To explain how they made that determination, and what exactly that means, I want to quickly check in with chad myers in the cnn weather center. What does that mean, ef-5? 
[00:09:30]



>> It means that a structure, a well-built structure, well attached to a foundation or slab, was completely wiped away in one place or another. They have found more than one place where these homes are just completely gone. Behind me, the classic shape of a super cell tornado. This was yesterday around 3:45 in the afternoon. The headf the storm here, hail core here, the comma, the tail of the storm here, the tornado right there. The tornado came out of newcastle right through here, and it was right there at this time. Let me show you the structure of the storm, though, as we take a look three dimensionally. This was picking up debris, this was picking up shingles and trees and everything else on the ground, throwing it into the sky. Thousands of feet in the sky. If we can rotate this around, it's an amazing picture if you consider what's going on here. We have winds at this point 210 miles per hour. Anderson, this storm went from zero, went from nothing, all the way to 166 to an ef-4 in just ten minutes. Now this almost 
-- kind of looks like a coral reef but in fact, this is not rain or hail coming down. This is the debris in the sky getting thrown as high as 20,000 feet up and obviously then raining back down on the people of moore and of newcastle. I am so thankful at this point in time that our numbers, our fatality number went down to 24, because last night when it seemed like it was climbing, when we were talking to the people there, the investigators, it's like wow, where could this go, because when you have a storm like this, that now we know 210 miles per hour, damage was complete. Some of these houses don't exist anymore. There's nothing more to see, not even the refrigerator, not the kitchen, not a bathroom. They're all gone. 
>> Yeah, the state medical examiner when we talked to her, the spokesperson last night, she gave us basically the wrong estimate. It seemed like they had doubled or double counted and thankfully that was a great correction they made today. The numbers went down, 24 still a huge number of fatalities. So many of them kids. A quick reminder, the needs here are enormous. They will be for quite some time. People from all over the country are trying to rush to fill it. The local nba team, the oklahoma city thunder, donating $1 million to red cross, salvation army and other disaster relief organizations. Go to cnn.Com/impact, again, cnn.Com/impact for all the links. 
[00:11:58]



>>> We're also going to get the latest from oklahoma's governor and the mayor of moore ahead tonight right here from live in moore. Also, it's hard to imagine how anyone could have survived inside plaza towers mental tribut they did. You'll meet another heroic teacher who knew exactly how to give her kids the best chance possible to stay safe. to take a centrum silver multivitamin every day. I told him, sure. Can't hurt, right?

>>> We had to pull a car out of the front hallway off a teacher. I don't know what that lady's name is but she had three little kids underneath her. Good job, teach. 
>> Good job, teach. There's a lot of people saying that today here in moore, oklahoma. We've seen it so many times in so many places, teachers saving young lives. For days, janice had been telling her sixth graders to finish strong this year. That was the motto for the end of their year. Yesterday, they and she certainly did just that. With the tornado coming, she found them shelter inside the school. She knew from her husband who works in construction that a hallway wouldn't cut it so they hunkered down in a closet, in a bathroom, and they made it. She joins us now along with her husband, mark, who rushed to thethe scene and helped rescue people at the school. Great to see you both here. When you knew the storm was coming, tell me what happened. 
>> I knew it was coming because mark was sending me texts and said you need to get out of the hallways and into smaller places. We actually knew it was getting ready to hit when the lights started flashing and that's when we all didn't just duck and cover in the hall, we went into the bathrooms. 
>> You were watching it on tv. 
>> I was at home watching on television. 
>> And you knew it was going to come toward the school. 
>> The weather guys were saying hey, this is going to develop. And the traditional hook that was on there was huge. And I go in the bedroom and come back and send her a text, this thing's developing and by the time I get back in the house, i mean in the front room, it's already 
-- it's already huge. And then the reporter, weather man, was saying this thing's going to develop, it's going to drop, it's going to be a monster. People, if you're in the newcastle, south oklahoma city area, you need to get out right now. And it was directly northeast of us and that's the way they travel so I was getting in the truck to leave and as I was leaving my residence, I looked over at newcastle which is maybe five miles and there it was. It was just a pencil. As I was trying to drive away, down the road, it just got thicker and thick thicker. 
>> You decided to go toward the school 
-- 
[00:17:26]



>> well, the radio was then saying hey, this thing isn't going northeast, it's going directly east and it was between the streets that the school was at, and I'm like this is going to hit the school. So I turned around and the thing had passed me then, so I started chasing it down 134th street and it was probably half a mile in front of me. And passing cop cars and people were 
-- the lights were out and I got to the edge of the school street where you go into the school and there were houses there and I thought this was a good sign. The tornado was just right there and so I went another block and then there was a little more damage, then another block and more damage and pretty soon i got close to the school, houses, you've seen them, were just tore up. I saw the school and it was leveled. And I had to use the four wheel drive to get around the poles and the wires to get into the parking lot and I was the first vehicle that I saw there. I couldn't other people and I'm thinking she's gone. I've lost her. 
>> That was your thought. 
>> Yes. There's no way anybody could walk away from this. 
>> And you had been previously told to be in the hallways but your husband said no, go into a closet, that's the safest place. 
>> Yeah. We've rehearsed this a lot of times. I've been at plaza for five years, and we were going right by our procedures, our principal amy simpson was wonderful. Her husband's a firefighter. He was there, about the same time mark was. We got into the closet and i held the door. 
>> How many kids did you have in that closet? 
>> We had five. 
>> You were actually holding on to the door? 
>> Yeah. Everybody else, we fit into the bathrooms. Fourth, fifth and sixth grade. 
>> What was it like trying to hold on to that door? 
>> Well, that's the injury i have. 
>> From holding on to the door? 
>> Yeah. We were all underneath that. 
>> So you literally felt the door being forced open? 
>> Sometimes it would pull that way and sometimes debris would come in. I would tell the kids we may get rained on because the roof's going to lift off. We are hanging tight. We are staying strong right here. Eventually, it seemed like it lasted forever. I think it actually hovered here for awhile. It lasted, it was loud. You could hear the windows crashing first. Of course, the lights went out but then it got light again because the ceiling was gone. But we were safe, all four walls of the closet were still standing. 
[00:19:50]



>> Did you know she had made it into the closet? 
>> Well, the last few texts 
-- the one phone call we had, she asked, do you think the printer closet is safe. I knew where it was right across from her room. I said absolutely, safest room in the school. From what I understand, she got in there and then the other teachers took the other kids into the bathrooms which were right next to it. 
>> So you go in there, you see the hallways destroyed. 
>> I'm going down the hallway, there's knee deep of stuff. All the roof now, all the ceiling stuff, everything is down on the floors, plus there's shingles from the houses all around are down on the floor. And crawling through, I could see the printer closet and it was three-quarters of the way covered from stuff on the outside. And I'm banging on the door with a piece of metal yelling. Yelling at her. And I could hear them in there and pretty soon, a guy comes up on top of the wall and says hey, I can see them through the top, I'm going to try to lift them out. About this time, the teachers that were in the bathrooms, they come out and the kids are just screaming, crying, and the teachers, some of them were 
-- one of them was bare foot and the kids were trying to get out and there was still some electricity because I saw some lights, and I said walk down the hall here, keep your hands on the wall, don't touch any wires and so they began to filter out one at a time. I said just help the one in front of you, okay. They were just crying so hard and the teachers were helping them out. About that time some other men began to come from other areas, two and three in the hall so they started helping them out, some more guys were showing up. To me it was amazing to watch, over the five-minute period that I was there, the number of men and women that were coming from the neighborhoods that had been destroyed to come and help try to pull out the kids. We worked our way around back where the rescue area was, where the walls had fallen down. 
>> You saw her again. 
>> And janice, when they brought her out of the room, we saw each other, I threw her a jacket and she knew she needed to go find some people and I went with some other guys to see if we could clear some other rooms. 
>> You went to try to help others. 
[00:21:53]



>> I was surprised she was okay. 
>> Thank you so much. 
>> Thank you. 
>> So glad you're all right. So glad for your staying strong all throughout that. Amazing. Finishing strong. Just like your motto. 
>> Finish strong. My kids are the ones that reminded me that's our motto. We did that today. 
>> You certainly did. Thank you so much. Really appreciate it. Just incredible. Janice and mark brim. A lot of kids owe their lives to teachers, no doubt about it. Seven plaza tower children did not make it. We remember them tonight. They're all across the area, the search for any additional survivors, that continues. Local authorities pledging to check every place three times just to make sure no one has been missed and everyone is accounted for. I'm joined by oklahoma governor mary fallin and glenn lewis, the mayor of moore. Governor, thank you so much for being here. Really appreciate it. Mr. Mayor as well, thank you so much for being here. As you look at what's happened today, the recovery efforts, the rescue efforts, how are things going? 
>> Things are going well. Under the circumstances, we feel good about our efforts. We're very appreciative of the people who have worked very long hours under very stressful circumstances and we have a great ground game basically, and we have a command unit and they are communicating very well. They're very highly organized. We've been through a couple of these disasters before and that's the key to it is having counication, having collaboration not only with the local people but the state and the federal and certainly with the charities themselves. 
>> At this point, mr. Mayor, do you feel 
-- are there still people missing? Where do things stand? 
>> As far as we know there's not. We checked the areas with thermal imagers as well as gone door-to-door. We feel like we're fixing to go from rescue and searching to recovery at this point. 
>> I mean, you think the death toll as it is, you think that's likely to stay 
-- 
>> I think that will stand, yes, sir. We believe it will. 
>> What are your needs now? What do you need? 
>> The needs are right now certainly counseling for those that lost loved ones. We've heard some traumatic stories. You just met two american heroes, the teacher and her husband, looking for his wife. And the teacher that saved the children. That's a hero story. It's a feel-good story, one that gives us some hope and encouragement during a time of such great tragedy in this community. 
[00:24:02]



>> So many people are banding together in this community. 
>> That's what oklahoma's about. We have great people and I know we're going to make it through this even stronger. We persevere, we're resilient, we believe in helping our neighbors and as you heard the story of people coming out of the community itself and just walking up and going to the school, going door to door. Even though they may have just lost everything, they were out helping their fellow man. 
>> In this area that has experienced storms before, do authorities need to relook at zoning, at mandating storm shelters in all schools? Because new schools have them but it's older schools that do not, correct? 
>> Right. We have some older schools that don't have storm shelters but we certainly have made great effort. The local communities have that decision that they can make to build storm shelters. We actually had a tornado that passed here a couple years ago and a school had put in a storm room in their school, and they all hovered there and they were fine. After the school got destroyed. So we know that we need to have a plan. We do have plans. The teachers followed those plans. They got the kids to safety. They were alerted at the school, some schools were able to evacuate during that time and others that were left with children there at the school took the precautions to follow what they should do and saved some lives. 
>> Mr. Mayor, is that something you want to look at more closely, moving forward? 
>> We actually, after the last tornado, we did that. All of the new schools that are now built in the city limits of moore are basically required to have a storm shelter area. So we sort of did that, but you know, it's like trying to get a swimsuit in a tsunami. It doesn't really work. You can't really prepare for items like this. And we just have to do our best. So they don't have seat belts on school buses, either. There's a lot of things you could look at for safety purposes but I don't think you can afford to cover everything. So that's kind of where we're at. 
>> Governor, I appreciate you stopping by and just wish you the best in moving forward. A lot of folks are going to need a lot of help. I hope you get it. 
>> We are getting it. We're very grateful to other states that have come to help us. We're certainly grateful to the federal officials that have helped us with our emergency declaration and we're going to get back on our feet. We're going to get this community what it needs, get people what they need. It's going to take awhile to recover but we will come back strong. 
[00:26:17]



>> Mr. Mayor as well, wish you the best. Thank you so much. Thank you, governor. Appreciate it. Mayor lewis, we want to thank the mayor and governor for taking the time to talk to us. Obviously been a busy 24, 36 - hours for them. For more on the story go to cnn.Com.

>>> it's one of the most heartbreaking images of this tragedy. Fields of rubble where just yesterday, block after block of houses stood. Look around here, it's as far as the eye can see, just houses have been leveled. Neighborhoods wiped out by this tornado. The homes were no match for winds that topped out around 200 miles per hour. For many to ride out the twister reaching a storm shelter often meant the difference between life and death. We just spoke to the mayor of moore and the governor of oklahoma about shelters and why they aren't more widespread. Gary tuchman is also here with us in moore. He's at one of those personal shelters. Gary, explain how it works, what it looks like. 
>> Reporter: Well, anderson, the people who lived in this house that was destroyed survived. They survived because they left well in advance. But if they did not leave well in advance, they would have survived also because they had this heavy metal storm shelter. I want to show you how it works. You open the door and you take a look inside. You see it's very cramped inside. There's not much room. But plenty of room to survive. Walk down the steps with your family, you can probably fit seven or eight people and important things in here, clothing, pictures, valuables. You come in and then you just shut the door and you are safe and sound as a tornado goes above you. There's no doubt the people would have survived if they went inside this shelter. When the storm's over, you open it up and you all come out. One thing to keep in mind, you may say wow, rubble falls on this, how do you get out. You don't lift it up. You slide it and you slide it under here. If the rubble does fall on top of here, lots of rubble, you may not be able to slide it but then you are ahe alive and presumably have told your relatives that you're in here and they told rescuers and they come and rescue you. One thing you might wonder, why don't schools in the tornado belt in oklahoma and texas and kansas all have storm shelters, all have basements. It's not a law and the fact is many school districts say it's just not economically feasible to have these. They cost several thousand dollars, these personal shelters. Anderson? 
[00:32:12]



>> That's why a lot of individual homes don't have them as well. It is costly for families. 
>> Absolutely. But there are some homes here in oklahoma that we've seen with even bigger shelters, they cost tens of thousands of dollars and you can put several families in them. They're not to be confused with survivalist shelters. We have also done stories on those on "ac 360" and people have stuff they can live for years under ground. These are not designed for years. They are designed for one tornado event. 
>> What about flooding? That can be an issue when you're underground like that. 
>> Reporter: Right. That's why a lot of people, you would think that here in oklahoma where tre are so many tornadoes, lots of people would have basements. The fact is, oklahoma has fewer basements than lots of other states that don't have very many tornadoes because there's a big flooding problem in this state. A lot of families think it's very unlikely we're going to get hit by a tornado but very likely we will get flooding. We don't want a flooded basement and we don't have a basement. That's the case here. A lot of people don't have basements. They don't have these shelters. That's why there are so many people in danger if a tornado does indeed strike their home. 
>> All right. Gary, appreciate that look. Thanks. 
>>> Charles gafford was one of the lucky ones to reach a storm shelter in time. When the twister hit he grabbed his camera and recorded some pretty extraordinary video, giving us a ground level view of the tornado. We saw a bit of it at the top of the program. He captured the scene as the twister threw debris and branches past his shelter door. That's the view from the shelter. Charles gafford joins me now live on the phone. First of all, how are you doing, charles? 
>> I'm doing all right. Still a little bit shaken up after everything, of course. But myself, my family and all my friends, they made out all right. 
>> As we're watching the video now, we're seeing all this debris passing right over the storm shelter, what was going through your mind? What did it feel like? 
>> It was so intense, I can't begin to describe the feeling. But I was more worried about where it was really hitting which was the school that was directly in front of us. It was basically just waiting for it to get by so we could try and help as much as we could. Right after we got out of the shelter, we raced over to the briarwood elementary to try to help some kids. We got there and immediately, there were just kids screaming, crying, not knowing what to do, not knowing where their parents were at, and there were even some people trapped under rubble, we were trying to help them get out. But it's just crazy because there's not a whole lot you can do when you don't have equipment right after it happens. 
[00:34:42]



>> Yeah. And thankfully, everyone at briarwood was okay. How much warning did you have personally that the storm was about to hit? 
>> I'd say we had about 20 minutes. There had been rumors all day that there was going to be a tornado, but when we knew that it was headed our direction, we could pretty much already see it on the horizon. So we had the storm shelter ready. 
>> We can see a house kind of peeking out part of the shelter. Did that house make it? 
>> The house made it pretty well. There's a lot of damage to the roof. The windows were busted out. But further down the left side of the street, there were some that were completely wiped out and once you go on the back side of their fence, everything's just completely flat. 
>> And once the tornado passed, you came out of the shelter, what is that moment like? What do you see all around you? 
>> It's like a war zone. It's ridiculous. It's just hard to believe that something like that could just happen. I mean, that was the first tornado I had ever seen in person, and I had been in oklahoma for over ten years. 
>> Well, charles, I'm glad you're doing okay and that the house is okay and you had the presence of mind to seek shelter. Appreciate you talking to us. Thank you, charles. 
>>> Just ahead, what the family of 9-year-old janae hornsby wants you to know about the daughter that they loved so much and the daughter that they lost last night. chalk heartburn? Yeah... TRY NEW Alka Seltzer Fruit Chews. They work fast on heartburn and taste awesome. These are good. Told ya! I'm feeling better already.

[00:39:52]



>>> sometimeses it's hard to tell what you're seen looking at. This is obviously now a car but it's just completely been crushed and it's really only when you get up closer that you kind of realize okay, here's the engine, this is the front of the vehicle. It's just completely demolished. Just as you kind of get used to seeing that, you turn around, here's a car that's been slammed into a concrete structure. It's almost upside down. Basically just been picked up by the power of the wind and just slammed in here. 
>> There are so many vehicles like that, just block after block. Some of them kind of fused together by the power of the wind. One of the families in mourning here tonight in moore, oklahoma is the hornsby family. 9-year-old janae hornsby was a third grader at plaza towers elementary. She didn't survive the storm. I want to show you how energetic janae was, how full of life. This is home video with family they wanted us to share with you. Her dad is a veteran of the iraq war. I had a chance to speak with him earlier today at mount trinity baptist church along with janae's aunt, angela. When you first saw her, what did you think? 
>> My heart just sank and i started worrying and panicking. I just needed to find my baby. I just kept waiting and hoping that I would find her. I was looking through the other kids that already had gotten out and just waiting. 
>> When did you get word about her? 
>> This morning. 
>> Where were you? What happened? 
>> I was at first baptist church. They had opened a shelter for parents that hadn't found their kids. 
>> What do you want people to know about your daughter? 
>> Just she was the best kid anybody could have. She was 
-- she was jenae. She was, you know, a ball of energy. A ball of love. 
>> Your face lights up when you are saying her name. 
>> That's my baby. 
>> You're nodding your head. 
>> Because I mean, there is no other kid like her. We're a unique bunch and she is all of our uniqueness balled up into one and I mean, she's the sweetest thing, the bossiest thing, the most fun. Always trying to make us laugh and just a sweet baby. Sweet baby. 
[00:42:10]



>> Does it seem real yet? 
>> No. It still ain't sunk in. I'm still hoping, you know, for that call to say we made a mistake. I just pray that that's what it is. That's all I can hope for. But just got to take it as it is. 
>> How do you face something like this? 
>> Just got to face it minute by minute, day by day. There's no way to face it. Just got to be strong and carry on. 
>> Does it seem real to you? 
>> At moments. You know, when it hurts, it feels real. But then when I can laugh and talk, it's not real anymore, not something that happened. It hurts and the pain is real. The pain is real. And I have a daughter who is 14. 
>> How did you tell your daughter? 
>> Honestly, I broke down and she was nearby and I don't think she knew was it a relief sob or a pained sob, and then she asked me is she okay and I told her she didn't make it. 
>> Life is not fair. You just got to take what life gives you, you know what I mean? I can sit and dwell on it and you know, let it ruin me or i can, you know, make my baby proud and keep pushing on like i know she would want me to do. 
>> He wants to make his baby proud. The hornsby family like all the families here who are suffering so much loss are in our thoughts and our prayers tonight, and in the difficult days ahead. More than 200 people have been injured in this storm. In a moment I will talk to dr. Sanjay gupta about the types of injuries that doctors are treating and dealing with. He talks to a doctor in charge of the emergency room at the medical center which was right in the path of the tornado. Also, very touching moment in the middle of the rubble, an elderly woman here in moore whose home was destroyed, still says her prayers were answered. We'll tell you why and what she found in the rubble.

>>> Welcom back. Disaster survivors sometimes find small miracles in a sea of utter devastation. Barbara garcia's home was destroyed by the tornado. When it struck she took cover in her bathroom holding on to her dog. She got tossed around as her house collapsed around her. Fortunately, she's okay. As barbara lifted herself out of the rubble she called for her dog, got no answer. Look at what happened as she was being interviewed this morning live on national tv. 
>> What are you 
-- what do you think of all this? This is your neighborhood. I can't imagine. 
>> This is life in the big city. 
>> The dog, the dog. The dog. Hi, puppy. It's a dog! 
>> Oh! Oh! Bless your little bitty heart. Help me. Oh, babsy! Oh! Oh! Oh! Come on. 
>> Get him? 
>> Oh, oh. Well, god just answered one prayer, let me be okay. He answered both of them. 
>> That video was from cbs. Just incredible. Small moment, something to smile about today on what has been a very difficult day. We hope that dog is okay. He was able t walk on its own. Obviously a lot of people have suffered and have been injured. This morning, the oklahoma office of emergency management said that more than 230 people have been hurt and one place the injured would have been taken was moore medical center but the hospital was in the path of the tornado when it hit town. Take a look, it sustained a lot of damage. Looks like the facade was completely ripped off. Today, dr. Sanjay gupta caught up with dr. Stephanie barnard in charge of the emergency room at moore when the disaster struck. Take a look. 
[00:50:31]



>> You were the e.R. Doc on call in a hospital that was in the middle of one of the biggest tornadoes in u.S. History, and everybody did well inside your hospital. How are you feeling about that today? 
>> I don't think it's hit me, really. I still just can't feel like i can take any credit for that. Like I said, I was just doing my job and knew what I had to do. But I can't even imagine, i can't even, you know, it is, it's very emotional because I'm like wow, everybody was, you know, did get out. Yeah. Words can't even describe, you know, how I feel. I do keep getting a lot of thank yous. 
>> Sanjay joins me now. She should be getting a lot of thank yous. We were over there earlier today. That medical center is ripped apart. 
>> The entire second floor is essentially gone. She got very little notice. She was watching television, she said, throughout the afternoon and then there was an all call that basically said it's coming. She heard it and at that point, they started to do their thing as she put it which was to take people to the center of the hospital. I think what was interesting is that they have a lot of tornadoes here so people sort of have more of a reflexive action in this sort of situation. But they were taking mattresses off the gurneyes in the hallways and throwing them on patients' heads to try to prevent head injuries. One of the biggest concerns, shrapnel flying around in a situation like that. The doctors describe people walked out without a scratch despite what you saw in the building. 
>> It is often puncture wounds and other things we don't necessarily associate with a tornado. 
>> Yeah. You have the wind, obviously, and you can get the primary force from that, but the secondary wave of injuries, shrapnel, anything, all these things behind us can potentially be a source of a penetrating injury. A third wave is when bodies are actually moving against unmovable objects like walls and things. But it's the second 
-- that secondary wave they're most concerned about. They did see people who have been impaled, who had crush injuries. Happily they didn't see as many brain or head injuries as they have in the past. 
[00:52:38]



>> It is extraordinary when you see the wide swath of this tornado, the death toll is 24 people. 24 people is a horrific death toll by any estimate, but given the power of the storm and just what we see all around us, it's kind of extraordinary. 
>> All the doctors have echoed that exactame thing. You can look at the buildings, even the hospitals as it turns out, and initially I thought it was going to be much worse. As you know, the numbers were sort of given to be much higher, as high as 51. What is interesting, I've seen this in other sort of disasters, sometimes you can literally have double counting. You have two different organizations that are both counting the dead and they're not necessarily communicating so all of a sudden, the numbers go double. 
>> I think maybe that's what happened because I talked to the spokesperson from the medical examiner last night in the 8:00 or maybe 10:00 hour. She said we have confirmed more than 50 fatalities, I think it was, or 48 fatalities and clearly, that was really double what the actual number is. 
>> Right. They were hearing from two different organizations that were basically counting the same patients. Almost double essentially so it was a bit of good news. Usually it goes the other way, where they undercount it. But in this case, if there was any good news, the numbers were a lot lower. 
>> That's certainly true. Sanjay, appreciate it. Anks. Glad you're here as well. We'll be right back. More from moore in a moment. nom. ??? The one and only, Cheerios ??? rolling.

>>> It's been a tough day here for a lot of people, for many other than yesterday, it's the worst day imaginable. For some, tears of relief. We've tried to capture that day in sound and pictures. Take a look. 
>> When we got here, what we saw was unbelievable. The debris field was so high and so far and so wide, wounded people walking around the streets. You know, they were walking wounded. They were bloody. They were people that had stuff sticking out of them from things that were flying around in the air. There were cars crumpled up like little toys and thrown on top of buildings. Buildings that were two and three stories tall that were leveled. It was devastating. 
>> There are empty spaces where there used to be living rooms and bedrooms and classrooms, and in time, we're going to need to refill those spaces with love and laughter and community. 
>> Our people can pull together. They'll find the inner courage, their strength through prayer and neighbors are out helping fellow neighbors and we'll take care of our people. We certainly have the best first responders and emergency personnel I think in the nation. 
>> It's like a battle zone. There's nothing standing, no trees, no houses anywhere around, no landmarks. You don't even know where you are, where you're standing over there. 
>> I don't think we've really processed what's truly happened. We're just trying to salvage everything we can. Basically what we can carry out. We can't get a vehicle in here. We're just trying to get everything we can carry out, pictures, keepsakes, mementos. 
>> Little kids, families with their homes gone, lot of people around here don't have insurance in this neighborhood. A lot of people do but there's a lot of people that don't. Where do they go from here? Just got to get up and figure out a way. 
>> The people of moore should know that their country will remain on the ground, there for them. 
[00:59:55]



>> This is oklahoma. When a neighbor is hurt, you don't ask what they need.

Other oklahoma tornado coverage begins now with anderson cooper who is live in moore. 
>> Good evening, everyone. It is 10:00 p.M. Here on the east coast, 9:00 p.M. Here in moore, oklahoma. We're standing in a neighborhood that is really almost unrecognizable. In a moment, some of the heroes who have done all they could due to redeem this disaster, you can see it stretches for mile after mile. The tornado was as powerful as they come. An ef-5 storm with winds topping 200 miles per hour. Stayed on the ground for 17 miles. House after house destroyed, a hospital damaged, movie theaters, stores, a bowling alley all torn up. The cost in lives, so far, 24 including 9 children, 7 at the plaza towers elementary school. Last night, the death toll was extraordinarily higher because local authorities counted the fatalities twice. 24 killed, several hundred injured. 
>> There are empty spaces where there used to be living rooms and bedrooms, classrooms. And, in time, we're going to need to refill those spaces with love and laughter and community. 
>> Mr. Obama said that oklahoma needs to get everything it needs right away to recover and pledge to do all they can to make that happen. Even as the search and the recovery goes on, we keep getting new and incredible pictures of the brutal storm, including some home video taken from the storm cellar as the funnel cloud goes directly overhead. Watch. 
[00:02:06]



>>> The photographer who took those pictures lived to post that tape and tell that story. Students had to settle for hallways and bathrooms and closets. Many survived, but some did not. Later tonight, we'll ask why aren't shelters more widespread. But, first, the latest from john king who joins us now. 
>> Reporter: Remarkably, anderson, 30, 31 hours after the storm hit moore, they say they are just about done. A FEW Is TO DOT AND Ts TO CROSS. They're essentially done with three sweeps, three sweeps through each of these communities. They've gone back and forth, back and forth. I was out with search and rescue until about 2:00 a.M. This morning. At daybreak, we met someone, we talk about the first responders, the storm cellars. Reena and paul phillips, they rebuilt their home after the 1999 tornado. The storm hit eight of them, including a 2-year-old grandchild go down into the cellar. They say when the first responders came through, they heard them screaming. Listen to a bit of their story. 
>> It was loud. And windy. And, you know, but once it was over, our cellar started filling up with water on both sides. And that's when the grand baby started panicking. 
>> Reporter: It must have been pretty scary. 
>> It was scary, but we knew we were getting out. We may have been walking in a little water, but we knee we'd get out. The people here in moore, and the people that's come in to help, they're family. 
>> Yeah, they put the come along on there and then they realized that they were trapped. 
>> Reporter: Now, they were helped out in the first wave in the first hours after the storm. That was daybreak after we saw them. And not long after that, as you know, there was a really cold, driving rain here today. It was horrible in the hours to continue the search. The search did continue. Neighborhood by neighborhood, you and I were talking on live television when we saw the search teams come back for the second sweep. No open gas lines, none of these structures were in danger of falling. And then you see pick axes and debris. Dogs with them, search dogs going in. The dogs are heroes, too. While we were talking earlier, we've seen one of them step on a nail. It is remarkable. This community, this morning, the loss of 24 of its sons and daughters. Several of them young children font. We will never, ever make light of that. When you go block by block and you see this devastation, 2400 killed. They are all but done with the search moving on out to recovery. Again, there's mourning to be done here, but it's a miracle. 
[00:04:53]



>> It couldn't be much worse. I mean, when you look around, it's stunning that it's not guilty. And thank goodness that it's not. They wanted to search three times each location, each structure, even vehicles. Once they've done that, tomorrow and the days ahead? 
>> A number of things. Still a little confusion. A lot of cell phones caught spotty. A few people still saying they haven't accounted for family members. They're going to double check and triple check. There's a few places they still want to double check and triple check. And then we move on to the clean-up part. They already think a bill yoon dollars in insurance claims. Already had folks in today. Taking pictures and walking around. So far, the republican governor has had hot prae for demonstration and fema. So you move into the difficult clean-up recovery. God forbid, if there's someone out there, they will keep searching if they get a tip on something like that. We're about to mark the two-year anniversary on joplin. Some folks are coming here for advice. 
>> Now, one of the best stories to emerge from this disaster, it begins outside briarwood elementary school. Frantic parents search for their kids. We just wanted you to watch this so that you understand 
-- and you don't need to see the video to understand what it's like for parents to watch what's happening to their children. This was in the school parking lot. 
[00:07:23]



>>> That last reunion was taken in the 8:00 p.M. Hour. Take a listen. 
>> It is so good to have you all here and doing so well. How are you holding up? 
>> Thank you. I'm doing great. I'm happy and pleased as punch with this lady right here. I think she had an intragal part in saving all the kids 234 her room. It was a miracle that the kids walked out alive of that building. 
>> Teachers do an incredible job all year with their children, but the heroism was fascinating. 
>> One of my friends said to me on her ipad that she thought it was coming. I just got all of the desks and told the kids we were going to play worms. And so I made tunnels. I said okay, we're going to get our musical instruments and play worms. I said we're going to play our musical instruments and we're going to play worms and we're going to play as loud as we can. I didn't want them to hear the roar. I didn't want them to know what was going to happen. And, so, we got under the desk, two-by-two. And my aid, on the other side, she got on one side and put her body in half and I put my body on the other half. And we started playing the instruments. We started singing jesus loves me. We started playing really loud and singing to you. I told them to sing as loud as they could. And if they got scared, they could scream. And so that's what we did. And I said when you get scared, you could scream. But keep playing. And we did it. And when it was all over, the kids told me that they thought the water fountain was leaking. 
>> That's what they thought? 
>> Yeah. And I said that might be rain. And then they were so brave and this little boy didn't cry at all. I said there might be heroes coming. One of them goes 
-- I forget which one, do you know which one said do you know what kind of heroes? Do you remember? 
[00:09:40]



>> Were you scared? A little bit? Could you hear the storm? I mean, above the sound of the music? 
>> Oh, we could hear. It was so loud. But the kids just kept on 
-- they were so brave. And this little one, he didn't cry at all. He was just playing his music. So they just kept playing their little instruments that I had. And then, finally, these people off the street just came and rescued us. 
>> What was the condition of the classroom afterwards? 
>> We didn't know because we were underneath the desks. And then men off the streets came and pulled us out and then got out first. And I was stuck and then they went one way and I went another. 
>> You had a head injury? 
>> Yeah. But I didn't 
-- I just got hit when I got out of the 
-- when i was getting out. 
>> In the video, you had actually been goi to a couple of locations trying to find camden? 
>> I had, I had. I had walked, a mile, maybe. Praise god he was alive. 
>> All 06 our teachers war so brave. It was our kids that were the bravest. They were the heroes. They listened to all of the teachers. 
>> Had you done drills like this before? 
>> We practiced all month. 
>> Oh, okay, so you just came up with the idea of the worm. 
>> Yes. That's a guideline. We practice safety procedures. The kids, we always tell them how important it is to follow safety procedures. And the kids were so good. Could you hear the storm or just your music? 
[00:11:46]



>> The storm. What was it like afterwards? Were the desks on top of you? 
>> No, the desks was in front of us. And the roof was on top of the desk. 
>> And everybody in the school was okay? That's just such an incredible blessing. And that must have been the most incredible hug when you saw camden for the first time. 
>> It was. I was so happy. I was praising her because i knew that she hept keep him safe. 
>> There's no doubt about it. Thank you so much for talking to us. I'm just so glad things worked out for you. Thank you for all the kids who just followed directions. 
>> There's a lot of people who did so many extraordinary things here. You're going to meet a woman whose house collapsed inside. Also, chad myers on what made this such a powerful and destructive storm. to take a centrum silver multivitamin every day. I told him, sure. Can't hurt, right? And now today, I see this in the news. Once again, centrum silver was chosen by researchers for another landmark study. This time looking at eye health. My doctor! He knows his stuff. 
[ Male Announcer ] CENTRUM. The most studied. The most recommended. And the most preferred multivitamin brand. The choice is clear. We are gathered here today to celebrate the union of Tim and Laura. It's amazing how appreciative people are when you tell them they could save a lot of money on their car insurance by switching to GEICO...they may even make you their best man. May I have the rings please? Ah, Helzberg Diamonds. Nice choice, Mate. ...and now in the presence of these guests we join this loving couple. Oh dear... GEICO. 15 minutes could save you 15% or more on car insurance. called. you. We're not in london, are we? No. Why? Apparently my debit card is. What? I know. Don't worry, we have cancelled your old card. Great. Thank you. In addition to us monitoring your accounts for unusual activity, you could also set up free account alerts. Okay. 
[00:15:15]



[ Female Announcer ]P AT WELLS FARGO WE'RE Working around the clockp to help protect your money and financial information. Here's your temporary card. Welcome back. How was london? 
[ Female Announcer ] WHEN PEOPLE TALK, Great things happen. 
>>> We're looking at the size of that funnel cloud and seeing the wreckage on this block. It's not hard to believe that this was a major tornado. It was, in fact, at the very top of the scale for tornadoes an ef-5. Just quickly to explain what that means and how the storm measured up, I want to check with chad myers and the weather center. Chad, explain the ranking system? 
>> When you get an ef-5, that means some building doesn't exist anymore. By the three, you're losing an outside wall, four, you'll lose a lot of walls and five you'll lose everything. That's where we are now. 200, 210 miles per hour. When that tornado was on the ground as an ef-4, this is what it looked like. Now we can look inside the storm and see how high that debris wa picked up, sucked up and inside of the atmosphere. We know now that checks, photographs were found in tulsa, almost a hundred miles away. That little part that you see there, that three dimensionality, that's the debris that was picked up in the tornado and thrown around. It went from an ef-0 all the way up to an ef-4n 10 minutes. And then it got even stronger. It got up to that 200, 210 miles per hour. And there are many homes out there that you just can't find anything. The fact that we only lost 24 people a actually a blessing considering how many homes you see with nothing left. Anderson? It is great to have you both here. When t storm was coming, how much warning did you have? 
[00:19:00]



>> I'm not quite sure. Ichs working. I got the word that the thunderstorms were coming. And then, as soon as that happened, it turned into a watch. And then, the next thing I know, I don't know what to do because my son is in high school, south moore high school and I didn't get my alert because my phone quit working. And so I stayed in the house. 
>> Where in the house did you go? I went in my living room. I had a hall closet. I went in there, sat on the floor, grabbed a pillow and put it over my head. It got so loud, I knew it was hitting. My ears started popping. I felt the suction. And, about that time, I heard my house just flying apart. The rafters came down. It was a good thing. 
>> So you were buried under your house? 
>> Um-hmm. Just that one area was the only thing that was left. 
>> How did you get rescued? 
>> Well, some guy, it wasn't first responders, he said something just made him stop. And then, after he stopped, he listened and he thought he heard something. And that's when he found me. He went and found a big rafter to take some of the pressure off of my side. And it seemed like 40 minutes, 45 minutes. 
>> How about you? 
[00:21:04]



>> I was 
-- she was somehow able to get a call through to me while I was at work. I just heard her say help me. I can't breathe. I mean, it was a hit and miss thing. Every now and then, a call would come through. So he beat the first responders out there, basically. It took six people. They could just get it up enough for one of them to grab my legs and slide me out. Finally, it just stopped. And I have the book 
-- I know how you are about the apps on your phone. I have the bull horn app on my phone. My heart stopped. I don't ever want to get another call like that again. 
>> She's right here next to you, so that's good. How long before you were able to be reunited? It took me about an hour to get to her. I finally gave up and parked and just started walking. 
>> It must have been a nightmare walk. 
>> Yeah. 
>> I'm so glad you're doing okay. How do you feel now? 
>> I still feel like I got beaten up with a baseball bat. 
>> You were missing two of your cats? 
[00:23:04]



>> Two of my cats were missing. We just found them. 
>> Where did you find them? 
>> They were buried in all of the rubble. 
>> And they're okay? 
>> They're okay. They were the two we couldn't find. That's ralphie and j.J. 
>> So you just went back to the house and they were there? 
>> No, we had been there about an hour. 
>> That's so great. I'm so happy for you. Thanks for being with us. 
>> Thank you. So many people, you know, rolled up their sleeves and did whatever they could in the moments after the storm to try to help their neighbors. Coming up, you're going to meet a heroic teacher. There is heart ache, as well. You're going to hear from a 9-year-old who wanted to talk about her today, about what she was like.

[00:27:48]



>>> One of the families in mourning here tonight is a a nine-year-old little girl, a third grader. She didn't survive the storm. I want to show you how energetic janet was. This is home video the family gave to us today. They wanted you to see their little girl happy, laughing and a big, beautiful smile. Her dad, joshua, is a veteran of the iraq war. We had a chance to speak with him earlier today. 
>> When you first saw her, what did you think? 
>> My heart just sank and i started worrying and panicking. I just needed to find my baby. I just kept waiting and hoping that I find her. I was looking through the other kids that had already gotten out. >>Hen did you get word about her? 
>> This morning. 
>> Where were you? 
>> I was at first baptist church. 
>> What do you want people to know about your daughter? 
>> She was the best kid anybody could have. She was janet. She was, you know, a bottle of energy, a bottle of love. 
>> Your face lights up wh you say her name. 
>> Yeah, that's my baby. 
>> She is all of our uniqueness. She's the sweetest thing, the bossiest thing, the most fun. 
>> Does it seem real? 
>> No, I'm just hoping for that call that says we made a mistake. I'm just praying that that's what it is. That's all I can hope for. 
[00:29:57]



>> How do you face something like this? 
>> Just have to face it. Minute by minute, day by day. We've just got to face it. Just be strong and carry on. 
>> Does it seem real to you? 
>> I know it is. But it hurts. It feels real. But then when I can laugh and talk, it's not really more than something that happened. 
>> How did you tell your daughter? 
>> I broke down and she was nearby. And I don't think she knew it was a relief sob or a pain sob. And then she asked me, am i okay. And then I told her, I'm sleepy. 
>> Life, you've just got to take what life gives you, you know what I mean? I can sit and dwell on it and let it ruin me or I can, you know, make my baby proud and keep pushing on. 
>> Hoe wants to make his baby proud. The hornsby family and all of the families are in our prayers in the difficult days, months and weeks ahead. For days, the teacher has been telling her sixth graders to finish strong this year. That was their motto. Yesterday, they and she certainly did just that. They hunkered down in a closet and other students in a bathroom. 
>> It's great to see you both here. When you knew this storm was coming, tell me what happened. 
[00:32:01]



>> I knew it was coming because mark was sending me texts. He said you need to get out of the hallways and into smaller places. We actually knew it was getting ready to hit when the lights started flashing. And that's when we all didn't just stay in the hallway, we went into the bathroom. 
>> You were watching it on tv. 
>> I was at home watching it on television. 
>> The weather guys said this is going to develop. By the time I get back into the house, it's already huge. And the reporter, the weather man was saying this thing is going to develop. It's going to drop. It's going to be a monster. If you're in the new castle, south oklahoma city area, you need to get out right now. It's directly northeast of us. I was getting in the truck to leave. As I was leaving my residence, i looked over to new castle and there was just a pencil. As I was trying to drive away, down the road, it just got thicker and thicker and thicker. 
>> And you decided to go toward the school? 
>> The radio was saying hey, this thing isn't going northeast. It's going directly east. 
>> So I started chasing it down 134th street. The lights were out and I got to the edge of the street where the houses were. I thought this is a good sign. I had to use the time to get around the polls and the wires to get into the parking lot. And I was the first vehicle that I saw there. And I'm thinking, she's gone. I lost her. There's no way that anybody could walk away. 
[00:34:18]



>> And you had been previously told to be in the hall ways, but your husband said, no, go into a closet? That's the safest place? 
>> We've rehearsed this many times. Our principal was wonderful. We got into the plaza and i pulled the door. 
>> How many kids do you have in that closet? 
>> We have five. 
>> What was it like trying to hold onto that? 
>> This is the only injury i have. And so you literally felt the door getting sucked open? I saw the roof coming off. Eventually, it seemed like it lasted forever. I think it actually covered there for a while. It lasted. It was loud. You could hear the windows crashing first. But then it got light again. So the ceiling was gone. But we were safe. 
>> Well, the one phone call i had, she asked me, do you think the closet is safe. I said absolutely. And from what I understand, she got in there and the other kids in the bathroom. 
>> So you go in there and you see the hallways destroyed. 
>> There's knee deep from stuff. All the ceiling stuff, everything is down on the floor. I pull them through and I could see the printer closet. A guy comes on top of the wall and says I'm going to try to lift him out. The kids were just scheming and crying. One of them was barefoot and the kids were trying to get out and there was still some electricity. I saw some lights. And I said I'll walk down the hall here. Keep your hands on the wall and don't touch any wires. They were crying so hard. So they started helping them out. Some more guys were showing them. To me, it was amazing. Over the 5-minute period that i was there, the number of men and women that were coming from the neighborhoods that had been dest destroyed we work our way back to where the rescue area was. And janice, when they brought her out of the room, we saw each other, I threw her jacket and she knew she needed to go find some people. I went with some other guys to see if we could clear some other rooms. I was just glad she was okay. 
[00:37:43]



>> I'm so glad you're all right. Finishing strong. 
>> Yeah, finish strong. My kids are the ones that reminded me, that's our motto. We did that today. 
>> Thank you so much. We really appreciate it. 
>>> The safest place to be was under ground. We showed it to you at the top of the program. You'll hear from him about what it was like to be inside there. And we'll take you inside another shelter just to show you what they're like and how they saved so many lives. it's customizable, just like a tablet.

>>> An incredible report capturing the tornado's fury while hunkered down. Some people like to ride out the twister reaching the shelter, ultimately difference between life and death. So many homes proved to be a match for this tornado. You can see the entire home is reduced to rubble there. Gary tuckman is here and he's outside one of those personal shelters outside somebody's home. Show us just what it looks like. 
>> Well, anderson, I can tell you, the people who lived in this destroyed home survived because they were at work. But if they were at home, they also would have survived because it's heavy steel, personal storm shelterment I want to show you how it works. It slides open. It's important that it slides open because if there's rubble on it, you couldn't lift it up. It only fits one person, so I'm going to take the camera from our photographer and I'm going to become the camera man for a second and show you what happens when you go down the steps and what it looks like. I almost tripped when I went down. I can tell you it's not a big problem because you know you're saving your life. This could fit five or six people. Right now, this particular storage unit is a closet that you would bring down. You bring down a light, you bring down refreshments and wats for the tornado to pass over you. Once it passes over you, you open up the door. In this case, the house was destroyed, but you are perfectly safe. You walk up the steps and you see the rubble and you see what's going on. I give the camera man back and with if you decide to get a shelter like this, it's several thousand dollars. One thing you have to do, if rubble, a car, a tree falls on top of it, you've got to make sure the fire department, friends or family know you have a shelter so they know to look for you. One other thing I can tell you, anderson, a lot of people asking questions, parents, students, why don't all schools have shelters like this or basements? And the reason is it's not required. It's not a law. And, for many school districts, it's not economically feasible. But to have a shelter like this or basement, the absolute safest place you can be. 
[00:44:45]



>> When the twister hit, he grabbed his camera and gave us a ground level view from the tornado at the vantage point of the shelter. So, first of all, how are you doing, charles? 
>> I'm doing all right and a little bit shaken up. Myself and fi family and all of my friends made it out all right. 
>> What was going through your mind? 
>> It was so intense. I couldn't begin to describe the feeling that I was feeling myself. I was more worried about where it was really hitting. It was basically just waiting for it to get by so that we could try and help as much as we could. Right after we got out of the shelter, we raised over to the briarwood elementary. Immediately, there were just kids screaming. There were some people that were trapped. It's just crazy. 
>> How much warning did you have that the storm was about to hit? 
>> I'd say we had about 20 minutes. There were rumors all day that we were going to have a tornado. 
>> The house made it pretty well. There's a lot of damage to the roof. Further down on the left side of the street. Everything was just completely flat. 
[00:46:46]



>> Once the tornado passed, you came out of the shelter, what was that moment like? What do you see all around you? 
>> It's like a war zone. It's ridiculous. Charles, I'm glad you'r okay and that you had the presence of mind to seek shelter. Thank you, charles. It's just incredible. Up next, dr. Sanjay gupta is going to talk about the kinds of injuries that more than 200 people in this community had sustained. We'll also talk to the doctor in the emergency room at moore medical center. No one inside that devastated hospital was hurt. American story. I'm a teacher. I'm a firefighter. I'm a carpenter. I'm an accountant. A mechanical engineer. And I shop at Walmart. Truth is, over sixty percent of America shops at Walmart every month. I find what I need, at a great price. And the money I save goes to important things. Braces for my daughter. A little something for my son's college fund. When people look at me, I hope they see someone building a better life. VO: Living better: That's the real walmart. me diabetes, I remember thinking there's a lot I have to do... check my blood sugar, eat better. Start insulin.

>>> We had to pull a car out of the front hallway off a teacher. I don't know what that lady's name is, but she had three little kids underneath her. Good job, teach. 
>> Incredible. As we've seen in the past day and a half, teachers acted heroically. Take a look at moore medical nter which was in the path of the tornado. Take a look at the remains. They moved everyone inside to a safe place. 
>> You were the e.R. Doc on call in a hospital that was in the middle of one of the biggest tornadoes in u.S. History. And everybody did well inside your hospital. How do you feel about that today? 
>> I don't think it's hit me, really. And I still can't feel like i can take any credit for that. Like I said, I was just doing my job and knew what I had to do. I can't even imagine. It's amazing. 
>> It's amazing that they were able to get everybody out okay. Sanjay joins me now: We've seen how long people can survive. I talked to the mayor and the governor tonight. They said they think the death toll is not going to change from what it is now. But somebody can stay alive for quite a while? 
>> Yes, some kind of air pocket would be the crucial point. It's been raining, there might be enough water. Recently, we heard of people surviving 17, 18 days. I haerd the same thing that you did, they think that they've accounted for everyone, but they think that's a possibility. 
[00:53:54]



>> There's a wide variety of interests. 
>> You have three waves of injuries. You've got the primary blast and then the secondary wave of injuries. They saw crushed bones, that type of thing. Something they didn't see that much which was a little bit surprising, the doctors I spoke to were brain or head injuries. The doctor, as you just saud, dr. Barnhart, they threw mattresses and blankets over them. She said that may be one of the reasons there weren't that many brain injuries. 
>> And there may have been other centers nearby? 
>> Yes, in the midst of this. They're setting up a triage to try to take care of people. And they're trying to evacuate places. They are trying to, you know, save lives and prevent injury while they, themselves, could be putting themselves in harm's way. It's quite extraordinary. She's only 34 years old. She came up and said I'm the woman who's in charge. 
>> Last night, she said they had confirmed 51 fatalities. They downgraded that today to 24 fatalities. What do you think happened? Just a mix up? 
>> It's something that I've seen before. What happens is sometimes you get a double count. This has happened twice. They just counted twice, many of those same people. Oftentimes, it goes the other day. What makes the Sleep Number store different? You walk into a conventional mattress store, it's really not about you. They say, "Well, if you wanted a firm bed you can lie on one of those. We provide the exact individualization that your body needs. Oh, yeah! Wow. Once you experience it, there's no going back. At the Sleep Number Memorial Day Sale, save on the closeout of our Classic Special Edition bed set. Now just $1299-a savings of $600. Only at the Sleep Number store. Sleep Number.

Do you keep your toys in that hair? She could keep a whole family in there. (laughing cruelly) Seriously, Muffin Head, did you choose that haircut or was your barber just blind? Stop it. Aw, I think we hurt the wittle girl's feewings. We're sorry, Muffin Head. It's not your fault you have weird hair. You probably just have a weird head. Why do you two keep teasing me? Hey, we just call it like we see it. Besides, I'm doing you a favor. Someone's got to tell you how dopey you look. This castle stinks, too. It doesn't even have a moat. Come on, let's get out of here. Aw, man! I got sand in my shoe. Hey, are you okay? Get lost! Hey, Fern, I bet you don't want to eat that pudding. 
[00:03:07]


(laughing) MRS. MacGRADY: Binky, the pudding is free. Go get your own. Hey, four eyes! Going to class? "Four eyes"? That was old in first grade. Oh, yeah? Well, how 'bout... Big... glasses... molasses kid! That doesn't even make sense. (sighs) Come back when you have some new material. Oh, Georgie! We've got a present for you. Is it a water balloon? Go ahead. Go ahead, it's really hot. I'd love to cool off. I'm not giving it to you now. Oh, come on. Please? No way, it's mine. The. Ha. (laughing) I showed him, huh? BINKY: Tough Customers, we've got a problem. MOLLY: Why couldn't we meet at the Tower of Pain like we always do? Because it's time for a change. That's why I called this emergency meeting. Plus they got kiwi soya milk froyo here. Try some. It's delightful. The Tough Customers used to get noticed. But since our school's been bully-proofed, it's like we don't even exist. So I propose we change. Change what? Everything. Our name, our attitude, our very reason for being. From now on, no more bullying! (gasps) (gulps) But what would we do instead? I don't know yet. What about menacing? Can we still menace? No. It's the same thing as bullying. Well, technically, Binks, menacing is threatening in a particularly aggressive manner, while bullying is using superior strength or influence to... If you don't zip it, I'm going to dump that froyo on your head. Was that menacing or bullying? 
[00:05:13]


MOLLY: We can't change. We called ourselves "Tough Customers" for a reason: because we're tough. And customers. Check, please. But Molly, being tough just isn't working anymore. Watch. Give me another free scoop or I'll twist you into a pretzel! (chuckles) That's physically impossible. See? RATTLES: Binks is right. We need to "re-brand." That's what companies do when they want to change their image. My dad's in marketing. Okay, so what's our new image? I've got it! (grunting) One. Check that out. What am I looking at? That. It's sheer muscle. George, say hello to The Buff Customers. (grunting) The strongest kids in school. Watch this. Binks, hand me that stick. (grunting) (grunting) Actually, hand me that other one. This one must be petrified. (laughing) What are you laughing at? Nothing, it's just... You guys look kind of silly. MOLLY: Yeah? Well, you look like a coat rack, Moose Boy. Why don't you run along and read a book? Oh, wait. I forgot. You can't read. I can read. (sobbing) That was a little harsh. Hey, I just call it like I see it. I told you the "Buff Customers" was a bad idea. She's right, Binks. We're just not cut out to be body builders. I think I pulled my latissimus. (sighs) I guess it's time we consulted a professional. It's not going to be easy; you four have terrible reputations. Mean, gross, rude, and downright peculiar. Still, there may be something I can do. All right, let's get the paperwork out of the way. Muffy Crosswire, LLC, will get 75% of all income generated from the re-branded Tough Customers in perpetuity, blah blah blah... Seventy-five percent? For what? For turning four rag-tag, talentless thugs into a global sensation. 
[00:08:11]


(shutter clicking) (blowing a raspberry) (thumping) Testing, testing... It is with great pleasure that I introduce to you the up-and-coming pop mega-stars... MCTC: Muffy Crosswire's Tough Customers! (music starts) ?????? Oh darling ?????? ?????? We're no longer tough and mean ?????? ?????? We changed our image into a pre-teen's dream ?????? ?????? We gave up our teasing and took up some pleasing ?????? ?????? And now we're what you see ?????? ?????? Four open hearts ?????? ?????? Singing for love... ?????? (sighs) ?????? In a band called MCTC. ?????? Yeah. (applause) Thank you, thank you. MUFFY: Donations, please. Molly. What's up? You didn't sing. Yeah, and I'm not going to either. This is the dumbest idea I've ever participated in. Hey! Dry cleaning isn't cheap. This is coming out of your change. I don't want your money. I just want our old group back again, doing what we do best. What's that? Getting our way. (gasps) Well, I never! Come on, James. I quit! And you're all fired! What do we do now? I have an idea. It's a long shot, but I guess it's worth a try. SLINK: We realize that noise can be a real problem in a library. That's where The Shush Customers come in. If you make noise, we shush you. Behold a demonstration. Hello? Sure, I can talk. I'm in the library. Shh! See? Instant quiet. Shh! Shh! 
[00:10:32]


(paper crinkles) Shh! Sorry. Shh! All quiet in the reading room. How about the stacks? (kids laughing) Shh! Talking is allowed in here. It's the story area. Well, no one told the Shush Customers. Would it kill you to do a little mime instead? MOLLY: Hah! Oh, please. That's even worse than Muffy's idea. At least we're trying something. Why are you so stuck on bullying anyway? Because I want respect. Come on, James, let's get away from these losers. I want to get some water. Get away! It's my turn, loser. MOLLY: James, what did you do that for? I don't know. It's what you do. Hey, we're really sorry. He didn't mean to... (sobbing) James, listen to me. It's not okay to act that way. I know I've done it, but it's wrong. I don't want you to be a bully. Can you tell her you're sorry? Well, are you going to say you're sorry to the kids you bullied? Yes. Yes, I am. MOLLY: It's a long story, why I started bullying people. I think because it happened to me, but that's no excuse. I've been mean and I've hurt some of you, and I'm really, really sorry. So I'm going to try to be better. I don't just want to be respected. I want to be led, too. And I know I have to earn that. Anyway, your friend, Molly. It feels good to all be back together again. 
[00:12:37]


And to be doing what we're good at: Being tough. Tough Consumers. (door opens) I got this one. Excuse me, sir. Did you know that this Chicken Lickin' underpays its employees? And you can get a whole chicken at the supermarket for half the price. And the fat content in those crispy dippin' lickin' sticks? And now... My name is Liam, and this is our third grade class. We are working on poems about bullying. TEACHER: What are your thoughts? What do we really want to let people know about bullying? LIAM: People can get their feelings hurt, so we're trying to stop that from happening. When you get bullied, you feel small, like a speck of dust. You feel like an elephant is sitting on you. You feel like a lion's attacking you. You feel like you're about to cry. Water starts dripping out your eye. ALL: Reach out your hand and help someone. Bullying feels like a snowman after winter. Bullying is a chain that goes on. To break the chain, you need to let it fall off. But when the chain breaks, their frowns turn back to smiles. Monsters are coming, gripping your hearts. If you like them, they're coming after you. And tigers coming to scare you. Take a risk and stand up for yourself. It makes me feel white and blank, as if I were so small I didn't exist. It makes me feel gray and hurts my feelings. It feels reassuring when I am about to black out... That someone stands up and says, "Stop it, bullying is bad." ALL: Bulling feels dark, black, purple and dark blue. You are not yourself. You are a bug and you just got squashed by a human. Bullying is not pleasant. Bullying is like being in bars in prison. It smells as bad as garbage. Bullying looks like the end of the world. Everything good is gone. Stop bullying. Bullying is bad. Be kind, be nice. Have a kind heart. And now... Lots of people I know have a hidden talent. Mine is table tennis. 
[00:15:03]


(whooshing) Sorry. Some of these hidden talents don't seem to fit with the people who have them. Like Binky. (crunching) (burping) ARTHUR: Who would believe that he's such an amazing dancer? (tango music playing) (music stops) ARTHUR: Or that Molly would be so great at giving advice? There's no shame in losing as long as you gave it 100%. Don't be embarrassed about being shy. It means you're a sensitive and respectful person. Embrace it. You don't have to chase cars. Yes, they're fast and make noise. But who's in control? You, Pal. You. (barking) But there's one person whose hidden talent I would have never guessed in a million years. It's... DW: Arthur, there you are. I was so worried about you. It's chilly out, so I brought you a hat. You have to protect that super smart brain of yours. Why are you acting so strange? Me? I'm just showing you my hidden talent: Niceness. Can I get you some juice? DW, I'm not talking about you. How about a little nappy-wappy? I'll sing you a lullaby? Stop it. You're creeping me out. (chuckling evilly) (cheering) (tapping) Checkmate! (cheering) (groans) You have grown soft, Brain. Weak. Why do you not practice more? I have no one to practice with. Pity. You could have been a worthy opponent for... Los Dedos. As it is, you will always be an amateur. 
[00:17:10]


MRS. MacGRADY: A chess club, huh? I've played a game or two in my day. In fact, in high school I was known as Checkmate MacGrady. BRAIN: That's great. I need all the good players I can get. Chess? (scoffs) Chess is boring. True. But Brain's serving free ice cream. I've always said, it's the game of kings. Well, I'll be. You've got me trussed up tighter than a Sunday ham. But I think Checkmate MacGrady still has a trick up her sleeve. Checkmate! Hmm... I guess that move should have stayed up the sleeve. Another game? I'd love to, but lunch isn't going to make itself. I'll try to come back as often as I can. You took my piece. Oh, sorry. Here, I'll give it back. Okay, and I'll just move this pawn up one. That way he's not threatening anyone. Thanks. Guys, if you never take any pieces, no one's ever going to win. That's okay; I'm having fun. Me too. (sighs) King me. You can't move like that. That's checkers. See, I told you that was wrong. Back to your own side, pointy head. Woo-hoo, field goal! (groans) If this is going to be a proper chess club, then you all have to understand the rudiments of the game. Yes, Binky? Where's the ice cream? That was just for our first session. Now, the point of chess is to checkmate the opponent's king. That means that the king is being threatened by... What if the king makes a deal with the other king? You can't. FERN: Well, we did. We prefer to settle things diplomatically. Yeah, Fern and I have a mutual nonaggression pact. That's not allowed. In chess, there has to be a winner and a loser. 
[00:19:20]


RATTLES: Unless it's a stalemate. Then the game's a draw. That's actually correct. I didn't know you played chess, Rattles. Grab a seat. Nah, I was just passing by. I didn't even know we had a chess club. Are you good? You certainly seem to know the rules. Well, I'm no Kasparov, but I can fiancetto my bishop and I've been told I have a mean endgame. Guard that queen, toots. I don't know what's going on, but it's exciting anyway. I think Rattles has him up against the ropes. Nah, you don't want to do that. That'll be mate in three. You don't want to do that either. That's mate in four. Well, then what should I do? Try moving that pawn. Checkmate. (gasps) What? You were going to lose anyway. Why prolong the agony? I got to bounce. Wait. You can't just leave. Sorry, I got to wash my hair. But you'll join the club, right? Eh, I'm not really the club-joining type. Later. (Buster giggling) (rumbling) (cheering) BUSTER: Let's do it again! (sighs) Please. I'll give you free ice cream for a month. Too much dairy gives me gas. Then I'll do your homework for you. And deprive me of my education? No, thanks. Fine, don't join the club. Just play with me. I need someone to practice with. All you need to know about chess is this: it's like the wind. Resist it, and it will break you. Go with it, and you can sail across oceans. What does that mean? I don't know, but it sounded good, didn't it? (bell ringing) Ah, it is the amateur, talking to the scruffy ruffian when you should be inside, practicing your game. I ain't a ruffian. I'm just misunderstood. This is my friend Rattles, and he's ten times the player you'll ever be. He could beat you with one hand tied behind his back. Actually, that sounds very uncomfortable. Oh, really? Well, then he can play me in next week's junior chess championship. Be prepared to be crushed by... Los Dedos! 
[00:21:43]


(laughing) (bell ringing) Who was that? Los Dedos. That's Spanish for "The Fingers." She's called that because she drums her nails when she plays and drives her opponents crazy. I've never beaten her, and I probably never will. I started the chess club so I could get better, but it's pretty much a disaster. Well, Los Dedos has just met... The Nail Clipper. Come on, I'll need help getting into shape. I might be the one playing Mighty Mountain, but all you guys got to help. Blatsky's Book of Classic Games? I've never read this one. Went out of print ten years ago. I want you to learn it by heart and be my chief sparring partner. You two will help me with my endgame. But you got to want to win. Now say it: "I want to win." (meekly): I want to win. What was that? Do I hear a mouse squeaking in this room? Louder! I want to win! (sighs) You two are hopeless. But you can still help. I want you to try to distract me while I play. Think you can do that? Ahh! Flying gophers! Duck! I'm not playing yet. But I like the effort. All right, team. Let's get started. (playing loudly) (tooting loudly) Is that all you got? Hah! Yeah, that's right. Sleep no more, because the dummy just took your knight. That move's not from Blatsky's Book of Classic Games. Oh, yeah. I just decided to do something else. Sorry, I'll take it back. No, no. It's a good move. You know, you've gotten a lot better. Thanks. I can't wait to see the look on Los Dedos' face torrow when she gets trounced. Me too. 
[00:23:56]


(doorbell rings) (rings again) Why aren't you dressed? The tournament's in 20 minutes! I can't make it. My parents had guests over and there was a lot of cheese. I knew I should have held back. (groans) I just can't resist a good Pont L'Eveque. But what are we going to do? I don't want to forfeit. You'll just have to play Los Dedos. Me? But she always beats me. Trust me, you're good enough, Brain. But there's one thing you have to remember. What? Have fun. It's a game. (groans) Now go. Play this one for the Nail Clipper. (cheering) (clock ticking) Who's winning? She just took Brain's pointy thing with her pony. (tapping) Hmm... Check! Checkmate! (cheering) That was beautiful. Now you are a worthy opponent, Cerebro Grande. That endgame? Sheer genius. I can't wait for our next meeting. And I better warn you, I've been studying up. Checkmate MacGrady is back in fighting form. I can't wait! You were never sick, were you? Well, I had a little discomfort, but I knew you could take her. So are you going to join the club? What's the snack situation like? Anything you want. Pretzels? Sure. Nah, too salty. Raisins would be nice, but only the yellow ones. 
[00:26:18]


BRAIN: You're so picky. Hey, when you're a prodigy, you can be picky, too. Hi, I'm Marc Brown. I write and illustrate theArthur books. There's a secret about the Arthur books that I bet you didn't know. In almost all the Arthur books, I hide the names of my kids: Tolon, Tucker and Eliza. This is probably one of the hardest to find a name hidden. If you look very carefully on Arthur's desk, the pencil holder has Eliza's name.

I better put this back on the plane, but... Uh-oh! Where does it go? Oh, I have to get it back together. Okay, let's see. Um... The propeller goes here. Uh... No. Oh. Okay. And, um... Uh... and that wing goes there. But wait. Uh... That's not it. Oh, maybe it fits here. Oh. Oh, no. It doesn't even look like a plane anymore. Oh, what am I going to do? BARNEY: There you go. One more, now. Whoa. All right. Yay! Oh, that was fun. Thanks for inviting us to play. Oh, yes, thank you very much. BOTH: You're welcome. I just love hopscotch. Whoa! Okay. Bye-bye, now. Oh, no! BJ's coming. Oh, hi, Riff. Have you finished playing with my plane? Um... Uh... Okay. So, can I have it back now, please? Uh, sure, Beej. Why not? Riff, what are you doing? Oh, there you go, Beej. Whoa! What happened to my plane? I'm sorry, BJ I wanted to see how it worked, so I took it apart. But then I couldn't remember how to put it back together. I shouldn't have taken it apart without asking. I'm really, really sorry. I'm sure we can put it back together again. 
[00:09:26]



( crying) 
( laughing) Uh, what? It's just so funny-looking. You mean you're not mad? No, I know how to put it back together. Observe closely. See, a wing goes on each side like this. Oh, that's how... The tail goes like that, and the propellers go on the front like this. Ta-da! I'm so glad you knew how to fix it. Oh, look, BJ, you're not the only one who brought a plane to the park today. Awesome. Oh, look at all of them. Let's all pretend to fly like an airplane. Do you want to fly with us? Just stretch your arms wide and... fly. RIFF: Whoa! Yeah! ?????? Diddupy-up-ba-da-ba-ba ?????? ??????

Hi, Allison. Hi, Barney. Hi, Barney. Barney, Barney, come see my boat. Okay. Oh, wow, that's a fine-looking boat. What kind is it? Is it a motorboat? 
[00:14:29]



( imitates motorboat) Or is it a sailing ship rocking and rolling on the wavy sea? Oh, ahoy there, matey. It's a little pretend boat I made from a milk carton. Can't you see it? Of course, Baby Bop. I meant what kind are you pretending it is? Oh, well, gee, I don't know. I just made it so it could float in the water. BARNEY: And there it goes. Gently down the stream. ?????? Row, row, row your boat ?????? ?????? Gently down the stream ?????? ?????? Merrily, merrily, merrily, merrily ?????? ?????? Life is but a dream... ?????? Oh, that is a nice boat. ?????? Row, row, row your boat ?????? ?????? Gently down the stream ?????? ?????? Merrily, merrily, merrily, merrily ?????? ?????? Life is but a dream ?????? I have an idea-- what if we sang a round? Sing around what, Barney? Not around anything, Baby Bop. But a musical round. How do we do that? Well, you and Scott start singing. Then Allison and I will start singing a little bit later. That's called a round. Okay. Let's give it a try. Whoa! ?????? Row, row, row your boat... ?????? ?????? Row, row, row your boat... ?????? ?????? Gently down the stream ?????? ??????

Oh, hi, Barney. Hi, sissy. How's it going? Hi, BJ, hi, Riff. Hi. Did you see my boat? Boy, that boat's tippity-top, Baby Boppity-Bop. Thank you. I made it myself. Isn't it pretty? RIFF: Yeah. I have always dreamed of riding in a great big boat. Maybe someday I'll get to. If you could ride in a big boat, what kind would it be? Um... well, I don't know. The kind that floats. 
[00:16:47]



( laughing) BARNEY: Floats. There are lots of different kinds of boats, sissy. Really, like what? Well, follow me and I'll show you. See you later, little boat. Stay right there. I think you'll be surprised to see how many different kinds of boats there are. Maybe we'll find one that's just right for you. Here we go. BJ: Look at that-- it's a speedboat, sissy. Oh, that's a long, skinny boat. BARNEY: It's long and skinny so it can go very fast. Yeah, a boat like that can zoomity-zoom-zoom right across the water. Oh, I don't like zooming so much. What else is there? BARNEY: Okay, let's see... Oh, here's a fishing boat. It goes slow so you can catch lots of fish. No, thank you. Too smelly. I just want to ride, I don't want to fish. BARNEY: All right, um... Oh, this is a special boat called a submarine. It goes underwater. Under the water? That's right. No, thank you. I want to stay on top of the water. Okay, well, let's see what others we can find. BABY BOP: Oh, what's that one, Barney? Oh, that's a sailboat. Those big white triangles are called sails, you see? BARNEY: That's right. The wind blows into the sails and pushes the boat across the water. I think that boat is my favorite. Hey, I just had an idea. Yeah? What if we make a big sailboat for Baby Bop? Riff, we can't build a real sailboat. We can do the next best thing, Beej. Yeah? Okay. We'll see you later, guys. Okay, bye-bye. Barney, Barney, Barney, come here. Huh? Will you keep her busy for awhile? Oh, okay. Thanks. You're the best. The white is nice, but there sure are lots of different boats. Do you have a favorite, Barney? Hmm, I don't know if I can choose just one. What about you? What kind of boats do you like? ?????? Sailing, sailing over the bounding main ?????? ??????

Ooh, do you like the sound of this? 
[00:20:00]



( plays jazzy tune) That's a trumpet, Riff, not a boat horn. Now could you please help me with this sail? Well, listen to this. 
( playing jazzy tune) No, uh, saxophones don't make very good boat horns. Riff, don't think I can hold on much longer. Ooh, lookity-look at this one. 
( deep notes play) Wowser! Wow! Look out! Beej, Beej, where'd you go? What? Let's stop playing around and I'll help you finish this boat. Oh, we don't have much time. Okay, get this off me, please.

>> And now, "bbc world news america." 
>> Reporting from washington, i am katty kay. Shock and determination in oklahoma after a mile wide tornado flattens these suburban neighborhoods. We are live on the scene. Local residents combed through the debris. Has the darling of the tech world been misbehaving? U.S. Lawmakers say apple is avoiding billions in tax welcome to our viewers in public television and also around the globe. Yesterday there was schools and houses and shops in the town of moore, oklahoma. Many do not exist anymore. A tornado that touched down for 40 minutes flattened this counity. 24 people including nine schoolchildren are confirmed dead. Joing us live from the scene. 
[00:02:58]



>> This tornado picked up cars and tossed them around as though they were pieces of confetti. That is the remains of a bowling alley. This was the highest possible strength tornado there could be. Winds of 200 miles an hour. The people are all used to tornadoes but this one was terrifying. It killed indiscriminately and flattened homes and ruined lives. My colleague has this report. 
>> It is about a mile right. 
>> This is the moment the tornado struck. It cuts down outside of oklahoma city. Tearing up everything in its way. 
>> That is a big tornado. Ripping homes apart with 200 mile an hour winds. 
>> Fires burned as power lines came down and gas leaked from ruptured pipes. They know about tornadoes here. Warning sirens have given many a chance to take cover. This family survived and emerged unscathed. There were many stories of near misses. 
>> The lord giveth and the lord taketh away. 
>> We thought we died. I got louder and exiting you now you see the last 
-- coming on door dosh coming undone and a ripped open the door. It 
-- glass and debris started slamming on us. We thought we were dead. 
>> The focus began to switch to a primary school that fell to the twister's full force. 
>> It is like you see, completely destroyed. 
[00:04:58]



>> The warning had not come quickly enough to get everyone out. Children and their teachers clung to the walls as the roof was ripped off. Any were buried by the rubble. Firefighters moved fast to free them from the debris. Some were badly hurt. One by one the emerged. 
>> All this was on top of us. Someone had to help her because her desk was on her leg. Not all had emotional reunions. This is the path that the tornado took. It is as wide as you can see and he goes on as far as you can see. Just over there amid all the wreckage is where the school once was. House after house, street after street destroyed. Cars picked up and thrown around like toys. Trees shredded amid thtangle of wood and metal. People's position scattered across the neighborhood. For the few who made it through the roadblocks, this had already started. 
>> It was really scary. I thought I was going to die there for a while. I laid in there and on the ground and held my dog close to me and waited to see what was going to happen. 
>> President obama said the focus was on rescue and also recovery. 
>> Who for all those affected, we realize you face a long road ahead. In some cases, there will be and a norma's grief that has to be of his dosh enormous grief that has to be absorbed. You will not travel that alone. 
[00:06:59]



>> As the work continued, the storm clouds were gathering again and forecasters warned war tornadoes could be on the way. 
-- More tornadoes could be on the way. 
>> Oklahoma is and what is known as the tornado alley of the american heartland. It stretches all the way from south dakota to texas. Why are there more tornadoes in this part of the country than anywhere else? Our science editor has the answer. 
>> The terrifying approach of one of the most violent forms of weather. Most tornadoes only last a few minutes and 
-- over part of a field. This one kept going for 45 minutes and headed straight for the town of moore. 
>> There's a lot of damage produced as this keeps tracking. 
>> Many pass almost unnoticed. Not this one. 
>> They prepare us for it being in the military in oklahoma. You never expect it to happen and what it does there is no preparing for it. 
>> America gets hit by tornadoes more than any other country because of its geography. Cold air collides with warm, humid air from the gulf of mexico. Triggering storms over what is called tornado alley. Tornadoes are frequent here. Let's take a look in more detail at how tornadoes form. First of the storms 
-- if the storms are large enough they pull air up from the ground. This forms a connection with the air the twist. The faster the rotation the greathe destructive power. Most tornadoes are narrow. This one was up to two miles across. All of which made it unusually damaging. America's worst struck in 1925. More than 600 people were killed. So far there is no evidence that over the past century climate change is causing more of them. 
[00:09:19]



>> With these erratic, unpredictable twisters that have ravaged wide areas of the nation 
-- 
>> tornadoes are unpredictable. The storms that freedom can be forecast but not the tornadoes one researcher has worked in oklahoma says it is difficult. 
>> We are quite good at predicting the larger scale weather patterns but as you get down to individual thunderstorms, that is a real challenge. We do not have the computer power to model the atmosphere on that sort of scale. Grace it might look as if tornadoes are becoming more frequent. They are not. More people are living in harms way. The storm th caused the tornado is not finished. There are warnings of intense rainfall and there is always the risk of more tornadoes. 
>> The search for survivors should be complete by nightfall says the local fire chief. People have been returning to their flattened homes many have put out camps. 
>> The weather as david was saying, that does not look great for the night. I know it is one thing to see these images and they do look terrible. I imagine it is a different thing to be there. As you are reporting on it. What are your impressions having covered so many natural disasters? 
>> Is completely terrifying. From the air you can see the updraft of air joining the clouds. I can see them forming across the midwest. Not all of thebecome the deadly tornadoes. You can see from the air the potential power. And it is truly post- apocalyptic. There are trees that have steel girders wrapped around them. It is the casual force of this tornado that was 17 miles long, 1.3 miles wide and had winds of 200 miles an hour. It is extraordinary to imagine. People say the noise was loud, louder than anything they had ever heard. Then you see the impact and the scenes of such poignancy. I saw a couple retrieving the body of r dead dog, crying as they lifted that dog. It is such a sad scene. Along with the extreme sadness, there is a midwestern matter- of-factness. They said on the west coast people live with earthquakes and re they live with tornadoes. 
[00:12:21]



>> Do they wish they could improve the warning time? 
>> Able have said they have 16 minutes of warning, they say that is a lot. They heard from the national weather service that their area had a warning around it. They say that was much more than they got back in 1999 when a tornado also struck this area just a mile away from where I am standing now. The questions that people are askiare about the schools. One school flattened and another damage. People have been telling me that one of the schools was a much older school and there are questions about why did they not have storm-save rooms, or ones that worst drunk enough to withstand it. There is so much sorrow and sadness over the loss of life and nine children so far we know have died. 
>> In moore, oklahoma for us. Those questions are going to carry around about the schools treated 
-- the schools. But get a look at other news that has been going on today. Apple is one of the worlds best loved brands but today today it was in the spotlight not for its latest sexy design but for its tax returns. U.S. Lawmakers accused it of shifting billions of dollars in profits offshore in order to reduce the tax bill. The chief executive was summoned to washington to explain it all. Our chief economics correspondent has been following that. 
>> It is a global brand and its devices are used in countries around the world. Apple has been hailed as an american success story. Politicians are accusing it of not paying its fair share of corporate taxes. 
[00:14:29]



>> The real issue is the billions in taxes that it is not paying. Thanks to offshore tax strategies whose purpose is tax avoidance, pure and simple. 
>> Their bosses were sworn in and mounted a robust defense of their position. /??>> we pay all the taxes we owe, every single dollar. We not only comply with the laws but we comply with the spirit of the laws. We do not depend on cap 
-- tax gimmicks. 
>> One made 33 billion dollars over years but paid no income tax over that time. Another made 74 billion in profit and pay tax on up tiny fraction of that. Ireland has long had a long 
-- low tax regime. It said it was not to lame for their level of tax payments. This was a global issue. 
>> Insofar that there is an and 
-- an international dimension, it needs to be tackled by having robust national agreements and apple is in favor of that. 
>> Whether it is apple or other big companies under fire, they sell goods and services arouvd the world and move money across borders every week. That is why many argue that no single economy on its own can tackle the corporate tax issue. The apple saga has pushed tax higher up the agenda. Tomorrow's european summit will focus on the issue. There is talk of action but concisely what needs to be seen. 
>> You are watching "bbc world news america. And" we continue with a look at ghana. It is a subject they both feel very strongly about. Saving wild animals from poachers. Prince william and his father, prince charles, are hosting a conference calling for global action. He has waned part of the problem on the world's growing middle-class for buying exotic but illegal products that reflect their press parity. Under threat, the target of poachers. Last year a conservation group estimates 25,000 african elephants were victims of poaching. For the rhino, the story is even bleaker. Their horns have medicinal value in some countries, even as a hangover cure. This is the harsh reality of poaching. Animals killed, the parts that can be sold taken and left to rot. In the unlikely setting of a royal palace, today's conference aims to find ways of ending this illegal wildlife trade. For the prince of wales, it is a long-term passion. Using his position to persuade and cajole. 
[00:17:56]



>> As a father and a soon-to-be grandfather, I find it inconceivable that our children and grandchildren could live in a world bereft of these animals. 
>> And for his n, a similar story. 
>> I sincerely hope that my generation is not the first on this planet to consider elephants, rhinos, or tigers as historical creaturesand the same allegory as the dodo. 
>> They want today's event to be more than just a talking shop area they described poaching as the work of huge organized, criminal networks that need to be stopped. 
>> Washington is not working. It is a complaint we hear frequently and the american public seems to agree. Only 15% approves of the job that congress is doing. It is not surprising that some members of congress have chosen to throw in the towel and quit. After 34 years in the senate, republican olympia snowe is one of them, she retired in 2012 saying she could no longer get anything done. She explains her decision and her new book, "fighting for common ground." You write about the failure of the political system. A system that is broken. What do you think that america is not doing that it ought to be doing if the system were working properly? 
>> In terms of the issues and focusing 
-- I think most critically to me is that america has always demonstrated the capacity to address big problems. At this time we have some consequential issues that have been long ignored and neglected. By congress and the president over the last few years. Which contributed to my own departure. If we were not galvanized to address these issues, when would we be as elected officials when it comes to the debt and deficit and tax reform and even regulatory reform that I have always been an ardent champion of as well. To lay the groundwork for more economical coverage for the americans 
-- average american and my constituency in maine. There is a disconnect between main street and wall street. 
[00:20:40]



>> Do you think america is weekend --!Weakened. This is one that I argued with my colleagues. We should have been laying the groundwork as we emerged from the recession. That would produce a stronger recovery. Not to mention the fact that we are dressing the entitlement reform questions that are lemming as burgeoning issues for the short-term future. 
>> You could not function as you needed to. Yet you say you're optimistic. 
>> I am a can-do person and i never give up. I take my fight in a different direction and that is the key for the american people to recognize and the audiences i speak to across the country. I tell them that there is a way to reversing the trend and turn the tables. That is to be engaged and to communicate with your lawmakers and change the incentives. We need to elect individuals who are prepared to engage in that kind of process. And finding out what is holding up passage of legislation in congress. What are the specific legislative options that could rake the deadlock and communicate that to lawmakers and insist and demand they work together on solutions to these problems. 
>> Thank you for coming in. 
>> Now to our ongoing series. Looking at the changing face of africa. As we reported yesterday there were some positive economic positions emerging. Donna is one of those countries writing and economic wave. Pre-k's first there were the asian tigers. Not meet the african lions. Growth rates but much of the rest of the world into the shade and donna is in the vanguard 
-- ghana is in the vanguard. They are splashing out at home. All that spending is fueling an economy that is no longer dependent on exports. Crexendo for the first time the african story is not just a commodity story. It is one of expanded income. Expanded opportunity. The growing milk last. 
[00:24:07]



>> You talk about this newfound growth, but is everyone sharing in it or are some people be left behind? 
>> We could do better as a country. 
>> Government expenditure on education not to help redress that imbalance. Spending has gone up and literacy rates with it. I went to school here probably before your parents were born. 
>> It was a little after independence, a time of unbridled optimism. Which one do you think I am? That is it. This guy here. What do you want to be? Rex I want to be a banker. 
>> You want to be a doctor. Why do you want to be a doctor? Rex I like ticking care of people. 
--

Here is the setup right now, we have southerly winds dragging moist air off the gulf. Hot, dry winds off the desert moving in a westerly direction. Then 15 to 20 feet off the surface and chilly air out of rockies, the three wind directions change with height than is called wind shear. It's a tube that spins horizontally with the surface and then the winds turn, and that jet stream helps to lift the area and that invisible tube rotates into the vertical and then it becomes a tornado.

>> Everything that surveyed the damage, where a torn reaches the ground, they have to go and look at the structure and what kind of materials are used and how the materials have been stroyed is where they come out with a maximum wind speed. We'll talk about what they came up with the ef 5. It's boiling out here with the sunshine 81 degrees, the dew point 66 degrees and winds out of the southwest at 60 miles per hour and the heat index 73 degrees. Oxford 77 and we flip to the south and east, many numbers in THE 80s HERE EXCEPT THE Immediate shore, the temperatures are only in the UPPER 60s RIGHT NOW AT THE Shore. Here is the moratorium that just came in, upgraded to an ef 5, this is the most powerful weather related system that nature can release in the world, you won't see anything that can create devastation like this, with winds of 200 to 210 miles per hour, the path of destruction with 17 miles long and as wide as 1.3 miles at its peak and yesterday they thought it lasted 40 minute, but now they bumped it up to 50 minutes. Ahead of this system, the temperatures really pumping in and in the midwest, notice the drastic fall from tulsa, omaha and international falls, a sharp difference in air mass, that is what is sparking the severe weather, it's blossoming again and eastern oklahoma, and northern texas, another round of moderate to severe weather there, with the possibility of large tornadoes yet again, as the system marches east tomorrow there is a slight risk, it's not as severe tomorrow but still large hail and damaging winds and lightning. That is not included in our area so we are safe for that in our area.

>> It's 4:30 and "action news" continues the team coverage of the tragedy in oklahoma. Including stories of close calls and cruel coincidences. We'll begin with tales of land and life. Sara bloomquist is live with more. 
[00:29:48]



>> The death toll stands at 24 killed including nine children. That number was adjusted. Initially authorities said as many as 51 people had been killed. Search teams are going systematically properly property through the construction zone making sure no survivors or victims were overlooked. The monster storm carved a path of destruction 40 miles long and 2 miles wide. The governor toured it block after block of homes and businesses destroyed and an entire neighborhood was obit rated. 
>> New search teams moved in this morning, taking over the hundreds that worked overnight. So far there is no indication that anyone is still trapped beneath plaza towers elementary school that was leveled in the storm. 
>> At this time dogs are not making any hits for persons. They will not declare that structure clear until they are down to the ground and have been through every piece of rubble in the building. 
>> Oklahoma city's mayor walked through the rubble and is amazing that anybody survived. Cars upside down and childrens school books and trees without bark. This was the storm of storms. 
>> President barack obama declared a major disaster and ordered federal aid to help the people of oklahoma in need. 
>> Our gratitude is with the teachers who gave their all to shield their children with the neighbors, first responders and emergency personnel, and with all of those who searched when darkness felt looking for survivors through the night. 
[00:31:53]



>> Doctors have treated more than 200 patients 70 of them children and dozens remain hospitalized at this hour. The national weather has people on the ground and saying that one area sustained damage consistent with an ef 5 tornado, the worst tornado, with speeds in excess of 200 miles per hour. 
>>> The nation's heartland is not out of woods yet when it comes to weather. Adam joseph is tracking the potential for round two all day long. There is tornado watches dallas and and southern arkansas, an active tornado warning east and north of little rock and a nasty line of storms moving away from oklahoma city south of tulsa about to enter the state of southern arkansas you can see the line with the very bright colors, with stormtracker 6 live 3d if there is any kind of rotation at the surface or midlevel, you'll see the tubes of rotating area with the storms and this is just an indication that there is rotation somewhere within the storms in southern or eastern oklahoma. Right now no tornado warnings or reports of tornadoes on the ground and you can see how dangerous the system is still impacting the nation's heartland. The torn came in as an ef 5, even typhoons do not reach 200 to 210 miles per hour. The energy released by an ef 5, it's the most severe can you get on planet earth, the winds coming in at 17 miles long as the damage path, the maximum amount of width and it was 2 miles wide and lasted 50 minutes on the ground. Just to give you a perspective of a 17 mile damage path, if that tornado made landfall in our area, which could never happen for that length of time. It would make landfall at norristown and travel the blue route to connect to the schuylkill expressway and make its way to center city and the walt whitman bridge. This is the path of destruction they experienced. Just to give you a visual how much real estate this wiped out in the nation's heartland. 
[00:34:33]



>>> These are just some of the devastating images coming from tornado ravaged oklahoma, the pictures burned in our hearts and mind and people average the world offer done condolences and are donating. One man lived through the lens and captured its every moment and his video is going viral. Charles cook was behind the wheel of the car when it started rolling. You see the birth of the tornado there when it starts to form. You can actually watch the funnel cloud taking shape. It stren edges and widens and cook was parked in the parking lot and turned into moore, an ef 5 with winds of 200 miles per hour, you can hear it through the phone camera and see the tornado there touching down and flattening homes and taking at least 24 lives, and another story being shared today is that of jason, the father who rushed his family into the storm shelter, he was rolling the whole time as well even the tornado was rolling towards them. You can watch this with the family as it unfolded real time on video. 
>> THE LORD GIVEth AND THE LORD Take away. 
>> They were hunkerling down below and while they were in place, the tornado destroyed their home. When they came out thiss what they found, the world as they know it, the family is safe but he says that his four kids were just terrified. 
>> They had tears streaming, they were trying to keep it together, when it finally hit, my wife said, it's here and my daughter said something about our house and before we opened the door my wife said, honey there is no house. That is their home and neighborhood today. Now to more of the images circulating social media. We see a fire burning right after the tornado touched down and the flames filled the sky with billowing black smoke, haunting ones from the elementary school. A boy being rescued by officials thereafter he was trapped beneath a collapsed wall and finally an image of hope, megan hadley from a local pet rescue pulling a kit and from a mobile home that is now just a pile of rubble. Thoughts and prayers to everyone in oklahoma today. Brian? 
[00:37:19]



>> Thank you alicia. A little more perspective on the miles per hour right now. What was savaged and what was spared may hinge on a few feet in each direction, this incredible video is evidence of that.

>> All the devastation in moore is hard because it happened there before. This is grown zero from an ef 5, once again. Some of the same neighborhood that were flattened yesterday were destroyed in 1999. Our own david murphy was there then. 
>> Different decade, same story. This is moore, oklahoma as I saw it in may 1999. In what was the worst tornado outbreak anybody had ever seen. 
>> I remember talking to people as they were coming back into their damaged neighborhoods in the wake of the torn. They were getting loss trying to find their houses because the damage was so great. And the cars would wind up on their front lawns, and they would say we don't know whose car that is it traveled so far. There was one house that was almost completely destroyed and the interior wall was there and a kitchen cabinet was open and there was a box of cereal in there. And this church, this was in moore, across from an area in 1999 that was absolutely devastated. We pointed out that other than the sign out front the only other damage we can find was a short from this telephone pole that was driven into the steeple of the church. And now the church is gone. 
>>> The tornado in moore comes almost three years to the date that a tornado hit joplin, missouri, it hit a police officer struck and killed by lightning the very next day. The people in joplin know how the victims are feeling, the city's manager says that they will do whatever they can to assist in the disaster zone. A team of a dozen police and firefighters from joplin are authorizes to travel to moore. And they will send more help if needed.

if you have high cholesterol, here's some information that may be worth looking into. In a clinical trial versus lipitor, crestor got more high-risk patients' bad cholesterol to a goal of under 100. Getting to goal is important, especially if you have high cholesterol plus any of these risk factors because you could be at increased risk for plaque buildup in your arteries over time. And that's why when diet and exercise alone aren't enough to lower cholesterol I prescribe crestor. [ Female Announcer ] CRESTOR IS NOT RIGHT For everyone. Like people with liver disease or women who are nursing, pregnant or may become pregnant. Tell your doctor about other medicines you're taking. Call your doctor right away if you have muscle pain or weakness, feel unusually tired, have loss of appetite, 

[00:23:27]


upper belly pain, dark urine or yellowing of skin or eyes. These could be signs of rare but serious side effects. Is your cholesterol at goal? Ask your doctor about crestor. [ Female Announcer ] IF YOU CAN'T AFFORD Your medication, astrazeneca may be able to help. 

[00:26:15]

We had a great spot, not easy to find, but worth it. But with copd making it hard to breathe, I thought those days might be over. So my doctor prescribed symbicort. It helps significantly improve my lung function starting within five minutes. Symbicort doesn't replace a rescue inhaler for sudden symptoms. With symbicort, today I'm breathing better. And that means...Fish on! Symbicort is for copd including chronic bronchitis and emphysema. It should not be taken more than twice a day. Symbicort may increase your risk of lung infections, osteoporosis, and some eye problems. Tell your doctor if you have a heart condition or high blood pressure before taking it. With copd, I thought I'd miss our family tradition.

>> Hi. I'm stephen jones. At robert wood johnson, we believe citizens need to be informed about the important healthcare issues affecting their lives. That's why we're proud to support the healthcare programming produced by the caucus educational corporation. 
>> Humanism in medicine, next on caucus new jersey. 
>> Funding for this edition of caucus new jersey has been provided by the russell berrie foundation. Cohn reznick, providing accounting, tax, and advisory services for more than 90 years. Fedway associates, inc. Roche. Horizon blue cross blue shield of new jersey, making healthcare work. New jersey natural gas, proud to support education in our communities. Berkeley college. And by wells fargo. 
>> Welcome to caucus.I'm steve adubato. You know, caring and empathetic doctors are absolu ly crucial to the healing process. Joining us here in the studio to discuss the importance of humanism in medicine are dr. Richard levin, president and chief executive officer of the arnold p. Gold foundation. Dr. Leah kaltman who is a general internist at the summit medical group. Leanne roberts, who is a medical student at new jersey medical school. And finally dr. Ravi munver, vice chairman of urology at hackensack university medical center. Dr. Kaltman, I got that right, did I not? 
>> Yes, you did. 
>> Let's do this. Throughout this program, you'll see web sites--several web sites up there. Pursue the information. Not just ours but connected web sites. Find out about humanism in medicine. By the way, I always say fully disclose. I'm going to disclose this. We are huge fans of arnold p. Gold. Dr. Gold-- not this studio but a couple of studios ago-- we sat down with him. And when his foundation was started, when he and sandra started this foundation, it blew us away that, first of all, there wasn't anything like it. And he was leading this effort to change the dynamics of doctor-patient communication and relationship. What is the foundation, for those who don't know it? And why is arnold gold a giant in this field? 
[00:02:36]



>> Well, arnold and sandra founded this is 1988, as you know. And he is a world famous pediatric neurologist at columbia presbyterian. And he began to notice that the trainees, who was responsible for, and residents, and his faculty were beginning to be seduced by the rise of technology and forgetting about the connections which are so critical to delivering optimal healthcare. 
>> The human connections. 
>> The human connections. 
>> Between doctors and patients. 
>> Yes. And now we'd have to say between all healthcare providers and patients. 
>> It includes nurses, who play such an incredibly important role. We're in affiliation with the new jersey nurses association. We're constantly trying to talk about the role of nurses in this process. So the foundation does a lot of important work in this regard. It's tried to change the way medical schools teach about the way patients and doctors interact, correct? 
>> Yes. 
>> Talk about that. 
>> I've been with the medical schools working as a preceptor-- 
>> what does that mean for those that don't know that term. Preceptor. 
>> A preceptor is someone who volunteers to have medical students shadow them during certain office hours. And the students are able to improve and just really practice watching somebody as a clinician. And it's now started in the first year of medical school where I have students rotating one week. It's actually a course of several months. And I think it just really helps enhance compassion, allows them to learn communicative skills. It's all changed. You know, years ago students weren't exposed until their third or fourth year of clerkships. 
[00:04:45]



>> It changes the entire dynamic. I'm going to give you an interesting setup. And you'll jump in here. I do a communications seminar in a lot of corporate and educational situations outside of my work in broadcasting. And I show a scene from patch adams.And I know you all know the scene. There's a scene in patch adams where robin williams, fake doctor and fake medical school student as well-- he's not even really a medical student--so he's in there. And they're going on rounds. And rounds are--describe rounds. Rounds. What are rounds? 
>> It's when you take usually students or residents all out to see patients and communicate with them. 10, 15 residents. They're going through. 
>> Sure. 
>> You know the scene? 
>> I don't know the scene because I've never actually seen patch adams,i hate to admit. 
>> Well, you'll recognize this. Maybe not today. But you know the scene I'm talking about? They're going through and the chief doctor--the big boss, right--he's walking them through. And they come up to this woman. You know the scene? And there she is. And she's laying there. And he says, "here we have a patient. And look at her." And her leg is all ripped up. And he said, "we have such and such neuropathy, blah, blah, blah. We may have to amputate. Any questions? Any osteomyelitis? Any this?" And they're asking all these clinical questions, right? And finally he says, "any other questions?" And there's patch adams, right? Robin williams. He turns and he says, "what's her name?" The doctor says, "what?" Says, "what's her name?" And the doctor looks at the chart. And he says, "margerie." And he looks at her and he says, "hi, margerie. How you doing?" She looks at patch adams--played by robin williams--and she says "hi." The entire dynamic changed. I know that's only a piece of it. And I belabor the point of the scene. But I thought to myself. And patch adams is part of this humanism in medicine movement. You know what I'm talking about? 
>> I get what you're talking about. But I haven't seen the movie. But I think that when you add the humanistic component with your patient, it changes the relationship and the way that you're actually viewing your patient. You're taking away that aspect of only looking at the patient from the point of their disease or their condition and actually as a human. And I think that's an important teaching point for medical students and residents and attendings. 
[00:07:04]



>> But you know, devil's advocate. Even though I asked arnold this question 100 times and sandra as well. Medicine's not personal. You can't get that personally involved. Right, doctor? 
>> Well, I think that's what people think about surgeons. And I happen to be a surgeon. And I really don't agree with that statement. Because I think if you're not involved, you take that certain aspect away from the care that you deliver for that patient. 
>> But it was important to know margerie's name. It was important to make that connection, right? 
>> Yeah. Because the problem easy to fall into is thinking that you are treating a disease rather than a patient who has a disease. 
>> She was like a piece of meat just sitting there-- 
>> she was a disease. And that causes all manner of difficulty. 
>> Forget about just her name. But here's what I kept thinking as arnold gold starting talking about humanism in medicine 15, 20 years ago with us. That the more you know about margerie--and I'm only using margerie as a metaphor for something much larger--as the more we know about that patient, the more he or she begins to trust you and will begin to believe that you actually care about her, about margerie the person, isn't she more inclined to share more with you? And are you then not more prepared to-- 
>> you know, I think in every specialty of medicine, compassion does build trust and confidence. And it's a matter of a doctor unraveling, taking the time, acknowledging symptoms. But unraveling beneath what a patient may physically show outward signs of. The time that it takes to really understand and have that sensitivity and sense what may be emotionally affecting them as well, really is a quality which we need to integrate and maintain with all the sophistication of technological advances. It's a challenge. But I think with patients, they do look to have a partnership with a doctor, not for us to be too authoritative but for us to be still professionally responsible. 
[00:09:34]



>> Now you told our producers that you have some rules about the way you communicate with your patients first of all. Is it true that you actually, physically, doctor, get down to their level? 
>> Absolutely. 
>> What does that mean? 
>> You know, the first 15 seconds of an interaction with a patient can make or break that encounter. 
>> How so? 
>> When you walk into a patient's room or walk into an office setting, shake the patient's hand, acknowledge their name, look directly at them, eye to eye. And don't look over the patient. Don't have the patient sitting on an exam table while you're standing up. Sit down. Be at their level. Be at their level both emotionally and physically. And I think that makes the relationship off to a good start. 
>> But you also said some other things. You talked about the importance of not interrupting. Well, play devil's advocate again. With all the pressures you have, you're running a business. I'm sorry to offend any physicians. But you're running a business, right? Was that a terrible thing to say? 
>> No. I think a lot of people do view medicine as a business. 
>> I didn't mean that as a negative. I mean, you are running an operation, a team. There are patients in the waiting room. If you could spend as much time as you wanted with a patient-- 
>> but humanism has to be woven into the reality of running a business. 
>> Talk about that. Because doctor doesn't interrupt. He wants people to tell their story. He wants to take time. But you have people in the waiting room. What do you build in? 
>> You build in the extra time. One on the things we must defend is the doctor's time with the patient. So as insurance companies, the federal government, whomever is screaming for more efficiency, there needs to be a stop beyond which we cannot go. Because it's the next question you ask that's going to reveal the secret in the history that! Will allow you to make the diagnosis. 
[00:11:48]



>> Explain that, "the next question." What do you mean? 
>> You've been with the patient for two minutes. The average doctor only lets a patient speak for 18 seconds before they're interrupted. 
>> Sorry for interrupting you as we're talking about interrupting. Go back again. 
>> Yes. The average doctor interrupts the patient in the telling of her history after 18 seconds of conversation. 
>> Because? 
>> Because the way we have been trained and the pressures that you've just described of being under intense pressure to speed things up result in that interruption very rapidly. Thought process is after 18 seconds, you've heard enough of that introductory commentary. And then you can hone in on what you think is going on. 
>> And you're saying that there's a very good chance that "the next question"--and more importantly the next answer-- may be a part of that conversation where critically important information is revealed that helps you make a diagnosis and ultimately care for that patient in a way that is supremely, significantly different. Am I making too much of this? 
>> No. 
>> And you're thinking what right now? 
>> Well, I think that not just coming up with a diagnosis. But just determining if your patient is compliant with medication. Let's say a patient comes into your office and you've been trying to treat their blood pressure for months. 
>> Blood pressure's the issue, right? 
>> Yes. And you notice their blood pressure has not gone down the entire time that you've been treating them. But every time they're coming in, you're chastising them for not taking their medication. But if you don't let them tell their story, you may not know that maybe them getting their medication means a $2.50 bus ride in newark to go get their medication and paying for their medication when they may have to take care of their children or their mother or whatever other economic things that they have to worry about. But you may not ever get that out of them if all you're doing is pointing the finger and doing the talking and not letting them tell their story. 
[00:14:10]



>> Now this... Is fascinating on so many levels. Because it isn't just talking about having a tremendous impact on the culture of the world of physicians, right? The arnold p. Gold foundation has been trying to change the culture of physicians for a while. 
>> Started with physicians. 
>> Right? 
>> Yes. 
>> But we're also talking about changing the culture of patients, who look to physicians to play this god-like role, if you will. I'll shut up and you tell me what to do, and I'll do it. And this doesn't sound like that. 
>> I think formerly patients really were more accepting of trusting a doctor's clinical judgment. 
>> Today? 
>> No. I think previously. 
>> What about today? 
>> Now with the internet available, patients coming in sometimes self-diagnosing themselves. It's a difficult situation because the role of the patient is now they might be more--it's very helpful for them to be more informed. Yet at the same time, we have to still work together and remember that the clinical judgment of the doctor also has to still be have a strong impact on which way we go to manage patients. 
>> Who's the quarterback? 
>> I think it works both ways. 
>> Who's the quarterback? There can only be one quarterback. 
>> The doctor. 
>> Not the patient? 
>> You know, that's a tough question. Because the quarterback might be the patient who's leading the doctor into making the final outcome of the whole story. 
>> Is the answer "it depends" here? 
>> I think it does depend. 
>> Depends on the patient. 
>> It changes. 
>> But have you found, doctor, that patients who tend to be older--i don't want to generalize and be unfair here-- but that older patients tend to want to engage less in this back and forth and are looking for you more to be the quarterback, take the ball, and control the process? 
[00:16:25]



>> For me, I don't really see that. 
>> You don't see that? 
>> I don't see that it's really age dependent. I think it depends on the individual patient. But to what leah was saying, i really think it's the patient who's the quarterback. At least for me. Many patients come to me with a diagnosis. 
>> Give us an example. 
>> They're coming for a service. A patient comes in. Their internist diagnosed them with a mass on their kidney, tumor, a cancerous tumor. The patient comes in. They're coming in for an operation. They already know. They've done the research. They know what needs to happen. But they're here to engage in a dialogue about how it's going to happen, what to expect, what are their chances of cure. 
>> But wait a minute. They're also coming in with tremendous anxiety and fear and confusion and misinformation. And by the way, isn't it also important that a lot of times the patient come in with someone else in this process. Right? 
>> Right. 
>> No? 
>> Yeah. Yeah. And we have to go back even further. And we have to talk about education, k-12 in the united states, and whether there is a place in the curriculum to teach the role of the patient. Make sure that every citizen has a voice in this circumstance when he or she becomes a patient. Because 21st century healthcare is largely going to be team care. And many people believe that the patient will be the captain of that team in most circumstances. 
>> So let me ask you. In terms of humanism in medicine, you are saying that for all the years we started doing this with dr. Gold, much of the conversation was about physicians and changing physician culture and medical schools and curriculum. You're saying the way this conversation around humanism in medicine has morphed, evolved. It's much more engaged around the discussion of the role of patients, right? 
[00:18:35]



>> Absolutely. 
>> Schools. Other players in this. You can't just put this on doctors. 
>> No. It's the entire healthcare team. The robert wood johnson foundation, not far from here, has a program which they've begun called open notes. 
>> I've heard of this. 
>> You know about this. It's the idea that the health record belongs to the patient. The patient ought to be able to see it and to modify it in real time. And so far, the experience with this has been extraordinary. Because both the patients and the physicians involved in this, both want to continue. 
>> By the way, when you log on to our web site--by the way, not just that web site, team. But put up our web site and then link it to the robert wood johnson foundation who happen to be one of our underwriters for some other programming. And I know that they have that program called open notes. It's important. Because in terms of being an advocate for yourself, you need to know what this program is. Because those notes are yours about your medical records. We have five minutes left. I've been thinking about another piece of this whole equation-- humanism in medicine. As technology continues to advance very quickly, isn't it hard for people who are constantly going on the internet and thinking, "hey, I'm keeping up with things. I'm getting all this new information. And that's my job is to constantly get out there and do that." Can't patients also get confused out there on the internet, rit? 
>> If you take a patient who, let's say, has had diabetes for a very long time, they may know a lot about their illness. And they may be very educated about what diabetes means to them. But the vast breadth and the scope of diabetes and its impact on other systems in your body-- they may not have that understanding because they haven't had that training. But I think the information that is available electronically and that patients can get a hold of is in a sense empowering to that patient. And we need to utilize it more to allow patients to be really involved in their team decision in how their healthcare should be delivered. 
[00:20:55]



>> I was thinking that one of the things physicians can do is also help patients navigate the internet and help them understand how to use it more effectively. One of the other things I was thinking is that we keep talking about what humanism in medicine does for patients. Improved outcomes, improved relationship between physicians and patients. What does it do for physicians? Humanism in medicine done well. It's not an incident. It's not-- it's part of your dna. It's part oyour life, your approach and philosophy. What does it do for you? What has it done for you? 
>> Exactly. So humanism and medicine-- I don't really consider it in medicine. I think it's humanism in general. We take what we do at work. We bring it to our friends. We bring it to our families. 
>> How? 
>> Because it's a way of life. 
>> Give me an example. Make it real. Bring it down to a real level. 
>> Ok. So we're talking about empathy, compassion. All right? Empathy and compassion. You should be empathetic toward everyone, toward my children, toward my friends. You should be compassionate. You should be respectful. 
>> And that's humanism in medicine. 
>> I believe that respect is one of the real key elements. 
>> I hear you. Here's the thing. I kept asking myself. A--can you teach this? Empathy and compassion. Obviously some people are more inclined than others. It's more natural for them. Others, I think it's very hard. Others are on the fence and they may be more teachable. You hug, though. No one taught you to do that. You just do this. 
>> I often for patients, I walk into a room and I say hello. I've known them. I give them a hug. Patients sometimes are tearful in the office for not even a reason that they came in for the office visit. But it is something that I just feel that I want to embrace somebody. You know, let them know that i hear your pain. And just comfort them into letting them know that it will be ok. You know, sometimes patients need that, a tight hug. You know, tissues, a follow up phone call to many of my patients. 
[00:23:06]



>> What does that do? 
>> It just makes me feel like i care. And I think they get the message that I'm thinking about you. It's just very important to build that connection with patients. I see a lot of my patients not just as a patient. They're an individual. And it's just part of, you know, working with somebody. And it's touching to see how they're affected as well. 
>> How rewarding is your work? 
>> I love what I do. It's very rewarding to me. I think all of us here feel that way. 
>> One minute left. She's the poster person. But here's the thing--is humanism in medicine--does it work because of people like this and/or you've got to get other people who may not be naturally so inclined to understand it and live it both? 'Cause there's not that many. Frankly, I'm sorry for embarrassing you. They aren't that many people who are naturally like the two of you. 
>> Well, these three are exemplars. But the approach is that everyone should have this. And I'll tell you that it's the rare medical student who enters medical school without these characteristics and strengths. 
>> So medical schools are looking for it? 
>> They're looking for this in their admissions process. These certain personality traits and qualities in the process. 
>> Well, let's do this. A few seconds left. First of all, I want to thank all of you for joining us. You are a credit to the profession. You're going to be great at this. And most importantly, I have a feeling dr. Arnold p. Gold would be very proud of all of you and I think all of us. Thank you very much. 
>> Thank you. 
>> Thanks for watching. Now let's continue the conversation about this and other important topics and issues on facebook. Visit my page at facebook.Com/steveadubatophd.

>> Rose: Welcome to the program. Tonight we take a look at the middle east with ben wedeman of cnn ander if as in fassihi of the "wall street journal." 
>> Many syrians you they find the means of the regime distasteful over the years, over the decades. But they realize if this regime falls that the floodgates are open for some of the worst elements in syrian society to take revenge. And it will be very nasty. And I think that there's no great love for bashar al-assad or the ba'ath party or the alawites among those that are loyal to the regime. It's fear. 
>> Rose: We conclude with nobel laureate michael spence and former hong kong chief executive tung chee hwa. Their new report looks at u.S./China relations over the next ten years. 
>> In so far as level of trust is concerned, I think we need to look at it two ways. They are individual companies. Both sides who are unhappy with their treatment and therefore the trust is much less. But then if you look at foreign direct investment going one way or going the other or the portfolio investment going one way or the other, there's plenty of trust. So my view is that on the whole things are moving well but the areas of discontent we need to manage them, lo at them squarely face them, the most importantly to look at the future wrote where is it going to be the next ten years. 
>> Rose: The middle east and china. What's next? Captioning sponsored by Rose communications from our studios in new york city, this is charlie rose. 
[00:02:52]



>> Rose: We begin with a look at the changing nature of the civil war in syria. Amongst the rebel forces islamics are taking an increasingly powerful role. Last week they lost control of key areas in the country. It's reported that president's bashar al-assad forces are taking back a city. The war is taking a toll on neighboring turkey and lebanon and jordan as well. After meeting with turkey's prime minister last week, president obama rejected any unilateral u.S. Action. Joining me are two correspondents to who reported on the effects in the region. Ben wedeman is cnn's international correspondent and he originally reported from turkey's border with syria where ten days ago over 50 people were killed in two car bombings. He's in new york to collect a peabody award for his effort covering the war. Farnaz fassihi is a deputy middle east bureau chief for the "wall street journal." She has reported on the impact of the war in lebanon. I am pleased to have both of them here at this table. Welcome. 
>> Thank you. 
>> Rose: And congratulations, sjr. 
>> Thank you very much. 
>> Rose: Just tell me where we are today. We've seen ebbs and flows in this. We've seen increased participation, it seems by people who are on the outside, whether it's saudi arabia and qatar or whether it's hezbollah. And iran. 
>> Well, I think what we're seeing is that bashar al-assad has gotten his second wind and i think from the beginning we tended to underestimate the extent that many syrians actually do support the regime and I think they've managed to sort of bring in those who do have an interest in seeing this regime continue and putting them in the field to fight effectively against what is increasingly very divided opposition. I've read that as many as 300 individual groups compose the opposition, the armed opposition. And they seem to be running into some serious resis difference a regime that I think is starting to push back. 
>> Rose: Clearly that would be true about the alawites. I mean, because they have got so much invested there. And the other groups that make up the 
-- supportive of bashar al-assad, is it primarily not loyalty to him and the government but a fear of what would happen if he's overthrown? 
[00:05:12]



>> Of course. I don't think 
-- many syrians will tell you they find the means of the regime distasteful over the years, over the decades. But they realize that if this regime falls that the floodgates are open for some of the worst elements in syrian society to take revenge. And it will be very nasty. And I think that there's no great love for bashar al-assad or the ba'ath party or the alawites among those that are loyal to the regime. It's fear. 
>> Rose: Do we expect to see, you know, a slogan 
-- slog, as they say? Or are do we look at anticipation of some events that could change dramatically the velocity of the world. 
>> I think situation is incredibly fluid. I think that if something dramatic doesn't happen like an assassination or some sort of intervention, a military intervention that we're looking at a slow slog of war. 
>> Rose: Over several sgrerz 
>> over a stretch of years perhaps or 
-- you know, every year we think this is the last year and it continues. This said, you know, the more this drags on, the more complicated the situation gets. The harder it gets to intervene militarily or politically. The more difficult it gets to also build syria after the eventual fall of assad. So I think there is a stake to see whatever is supposed to happen happen as quickly as possible. Also the situation of refugees is quite dire. There are millions of refugees in bordering countries in turkey in lebanon, in syria. Imagine if they're going through several other winters that way i think there will be international pressure building up on that front as well. 
>> Rose: Do what? To have a conference or to intervene? 
>> That's a good question. I think this is a dilemma. Do you intervene or try to put pressure or talk to iran and china and russia? Particularly iran and russia which are supporting mr. Assad. 
[00:07:24]



>> Rose: But I thought they were in favor of a conference. Or not? 
>> In favor of a conference? They're in favor of a conference but they're not in favor of assad's removal from power. 
>> Rose: As a condition to a conference. 
>> As a condition to a conference. And the opposition say we will not 
-- we can't imagine a future where assad or his government are part of a transitional government. So I think this needs to 
-- this block needs to be overcomed for the to find some sort of a solution. 
>> Rose: You both have been on the border. How bad is it, these refugee camps? 
>> They're bad. Now 
-- I was just there just a week ago and the weather is nice and I think that makes a huge difference. Obviously there's camps in jordan on the border out in completionly exposed territory. It's been two very rainy winters in a row in the middle east. It's muddy, there aren't enough health facilities, there's not enough in terms of keeping people busy. 
>> Rose: And speaking of the jordanian camps, what is the threat to that to the jordanian government? 
>> Well, let's keep in mind that jordan has had over the deck wades wave after wave of refugees. First the palestinians who make up well over 50% of the population. Then there were the iraqis. Now there are the syriansand we've seen estimates that at this point the syrian refugees in jordan make up as much as 10% of the population. This is a small country of four and a half to five million people with very limited resources. They desperately need the help of the international community just to keep people housed and clothed and fed and now it's 
-- 
>> Rose: Why is that hard? Mef money. 
>> Rose: Well, there's the bureaucracy of actually getting the money and the help to refugees. We've seen this. I saw this in afghanistan in iraq and now 
-- 
>> Rose: There's also the question of 
-- what is the level of participation? We know where saudi arabia is and we know where qatar is. We know where iran is and we know where 
-- but is there is there any commitment to say look we 
-- as a humanitarian choice we have to do something. 
[00:09:45]



>> Well, I think if you look at jordan which is a strategic friend of the united states they cannot afford to let syria just blow the regi off the map. Just the instability. So they understand that jordan is a country, a regime, that needs to be protected at very high cost if necessary. I don't think that the americans are going to let the monarchy fall ove this. But it's 
-- it shakes. It feel it is tremors from syria whether it's the refugees, the military situation, the political situation because we have to keep in mind that the middle east for two and a half years now has been shaking, a constant earthquake. Libya, egypt, it is, syria. It's shaking 
-- tunisia it's shaking the foundations of the whole regime system. 
>> Rose: I want to come back to, that especially egypt. Let me stay with the composition of the rebels and how many groups there were and the composition of 
-- how powerful 
-- I mean, I think I'm right in saying that the most influential fighters may be al nusra? 
>> Yes, I mean, they're gaining ground, charlie. They're very well funded and some of the funding is coming from private individuals in places like 
-- some places like saudi arabia and kuwait. 
>> Rose: This is all about religion and about sunni versus something? 
>> Sunni versus shi'a. It's about the rise of the salafi version of islam that we've also seen gain ground in egypt. So they're very organized, they're getting money and they're good fighters because a lot of them have experience fighting in places like libya and afghanistan and chechnya. So they're all coming in and the question is what are they going to do after? 
>> It's said that some of the other forces are joining them because they have weapons and they're more effective fighting forces therefore this is kind of saying, look, they're doing better and I want to help them. 
>> You go with the winner. 
[00:11:45]



>> Rose: Go with the winner is the better way to put it. 
>> What I saw in aleppo was despite all of that there is a real gap between the people of the city and the salafis who've come in from the country side. 
>> Rose: A little bit like al qaeda in iraq? 
>> To a certain extent, yes. Maybe not quite as stark but there's resentment. There's fear. There's a feeling among many people in aleppo, for instance, that one form of dictatorship has been replaced with another which may be even more dystasteful. So I wouldn't rule out the possibility as time goes on that the differences between city people and al nusra become more and more stark. 
>> But they're not going to disappear. 
>> No, no. 
>> They will have a presence in post-assad syria and they might continue fighting with the alawites. They might stage suicide bombs the way we see in iraq. 
>> Rose: Is this too far gone create any kind of unity among forces fighting and is it too far gone to have some 
-- 
>> it's very, very difficult. Even among the non-islamists. Even if you take the opposition that's non-islamist that's secular minded that their vision is to create some sort of a democracy after assad, even those sides are divided. There's a lot of rivalry amongst them andack stabbing. So it just seems like a hodgepodge on the ground. 
>> Rose: 
>> And I think it's all these divisions which have strengthened the assad regime. P.M.C. How divided, how ideologically they're all over the map and they don't want everyone 
-- 
>> it's becoming a self-fulfill prophesy for ira and hezbollah and you see a shift in the way that iran and hezbollah are now actually acknowledging that they're helping the assad regime because there's al qaeda fighting there. Because they're islamists, because the shi'as are under threat, the alawites are under threat. Whereas a year ago it was very covert that they wouldn't publicly come out and say yes, because they were embarrassed to say they're supporting an oppressor. But events on the ground have shifted to such a large degree that they're no longer ashamed of saying we support assad. 
[00:14:03]



>> Rose: And what role are the russians playing? 
>> WELL, THERE'S IS-300s. But I think more than anything i think the russians realize that they've seen their friend in libya fall. Syria is really central to the middle east. Whoever controls it. And for russians to lose their friend in damascus and have it replaced with god knows what they don't want to do it. I think they're willing to spend politically, militarily, economically what it takes to keep this regime in power or some grand bargain to ease it out. But I think that that's 
-- 
>> Rose: Something to replace it it would not be the rebels. 
>> Some hybrid transitional government. But it doesn't work in these situations. 
>> I think the same is true for iran. I think iran put all its stakes into keeping assad in power: Money, weapons, fighters and it just wasn't to see this regime go because its influence in the region will be significantly diminished. 
>> Rose: All these reasons are why assad seems to be doing better right now. 
>> Exactly. He has friends. Powerful friends and this is why he's managed to stay in power, i think. 
>> Rose: And then there are chemical weapons. And what's the fear today. We obviously know about the stories that came up about a red line and the use of what a level of chemical weapons by the regime 
-- I assume that's been proven and everybody accepts that now? Or not. 
>> Not necessarily. It's sort of all anecdotal and spread all over the place and the use doesn't necessarily 
-- chemical weapons are by their nature a weapon of mass destruction. If you're killing two people here, three people there, it doesn't necessarily make a lot of sense and what we saw, for instance, in places like libya is that when the rebels would overrun a base they ransacked the place. They don't know what they're touching, what they're looking at. I mean, I'm 
-- you know, I think that we have to be skeptical about these claims until solid proof is presented. 
[00:16:08]



>> Rose: What is your assessment of what circumstances that bashar al-assad would use them? 
>> It would really be desperate sort of berlin bunker scenario. 
>> Rose: There was an assumption when he first came to power that he certainly was not his father and he was not even his brother. 
>> Yes. I think that his image has been completely tarnished. I don't think that he can ever say that I'm not responsible for the killing of the 80, thousand plus have that have died so far in syria. Or that he didn't order the bombings. He is at the end of the day the president of syria and with that comes sort of responsibility. 
>> Rose: Well, the other part of that is people have more respect for his toughness, is my point, too. 
>> Do they have respect for his toughness? His supporters might. I think his supporters probably think his toughness is a good thing in the twisted way that the middle easterner things that 
-- I remember in iraq people would say "we need a light saddam." 
>> Rose: Saddam light. 
>> A saddam light, right. We need another dictator to sort that out. Saws so there is a sense because it's a tribal society. They're always used to answering to one person, having a sort of 
-- 
>> I think it's important to keep in mind that there is a consensus within the top leadership behind him. It's not that he's an absolute dictator who can snap his fingers. He has to consult with his generals. 
>> Rose: His fati was. 
>> Even him. You have to have the agreement of your top intelligence military men before you take any course of action. 
>> Rose: And share analysis of the problem. 
>> Yes. An he's sort of the figure head but I wouldn't call him an absolute dictator in the sense that 
-- he's not 
-- 
>> Rose: But not a figure ned the sense that people ma imagined he might be in the beginning. 
>> Yeah. 
>> Rose: Lebanon. What's going on in lebanon? 
>> Lebanon has remarkably stayed away from the syrian conflict in terms of seeing, you know, a renewal of civil war or sunni fighting but there are plaerups of violence all over. There's been pillover violence in the northern border of lebanon. The government's been very unstable. The prime minister just recently resigned and they named a new one. So syria has had a profound impact on lebanon. 
[00:18:26]



>> Rose: You can say that again. (Laughs) 
>> the worst is still to come. The economy is devastated because there's not 
-- it's not coming. A lot of refugees 
-- 
>> Rose: Syria's becoming lebanon? 
>> Lebanon 
-- the roles are reversed. Syria always used to host the lebanese refugees escaping from war, now it's the reverse. 
>> Rose: Now let me move to egypt. We now have the president appointing more islamists. Anything surprise you about what's going noncairo? 
>> I think a lot of people are surprised because during the era of mubarak people looked at the muslim brotherhood as opposition real opposition that had sort of stuck by its guns and gone through prison and been tortured and what not and they had been able to carry on all the way through. And people expected them to do a bit better than they did. 
>> Rose: At governance. Because they were organized? 
>> They were organized and the top leadership tends to be western educated, very sort of modern in their thinking. 
>> Rose: But why weren't they? 
>> Well, I think that first of all they're paranoid. They don't trust the army. They don't trust the police. They don't trust intelligence. 
>> Rose: They changed the top of the army, didn't they? 
>> Yeah, but that's just the guys at the top. What egyptians like to tell you about the deep state, the real state with interests 
-- not the rank-and-file but the bureaucratic corporate interests of the state which will not be touched. So the brotherhood is paranoid about them. Yes, they removed the top generals. But the officer corps is still there. They can't touch the intelligence services. They know the police are unhappy. So on the one hand they're worried about the state, the deep state. On the other they know there's constant unhappiness with their performance economically. The young revolutionaries, those who haven't become completely depressed are constantly agitating against the brotherhood, against mohamed morsi. So they have sort of a siege mentality that have is not helping the day to day running of the country. And we see the economy is just in constant freefall. The egyptian pound reached a historic low the other day. And confidence in the government is eroding daily. But --. 
[00:20:59]



>> Rose: So is there a reflection point? At some point they say the center cannot hold? 
>> But you have release valves that didn't exist before. You do have elections coming up. And so I think people are looking to those elections as an opportunity to change and opinion polls have shown that a lot of the people who voted for the brotherhood say they won't vote next time. 
>> Rose: Will not vote or will not vote for the brotherhood? 
>> Will not vote for the brotherhood. But then you always get back to the fact that the brotherhood has sort of given up on a lot of the urban areas: Alexandria, cairo, and have always focused on organizing, patronage in the countryside. And they're very good at on election day getting federal reserve this village, that village, on the bus go vote and 
-- 
>> Rose: There was a great hope in the begin by some who suggest that having power would moderate the brotherhood. That they would understand that it's one thing to engage in rhetoric but it's something else when you've got to 
-- you know, educate and pave the streets and do all the things that 
-- and raise revenue and do all the things that a government has to do. That have that would in a sense cause them to moderate. Didn't happen? 
>> It didn't happen. On the other hand, I think that sometimes we listen too much to the fluent english speaking intelligentsia who's highly critical. A lot of egyptians say "i don't care who runs the country at this point. Just please run the country." 
>> Rose: (Laughs) that's why we like having you here. We won't get wrapped up in what all these pundits say. We want somebody who's been on the ground and talked to real people. Iranian elections are coming up. Rafsanjani is in. 
>> Rafsanjani is in. Tomorrow they're going to announce which one of these candidates made it through the guardian council's vetting system. 
[00:23:05]



>> Rose: Who might not make it? 
>> There's ahmadinejad's right hand man and very close aide. There's a lot of talk he might not make it. 
>> Rose: If he doesn't make it, it's a slan at ahmadinejad? 
>> But I don't think the fight will be over. I think ahmadinejad will do everything in his power, including spilling some political secrets, threatening to resign. 
>> Rose: That's the kind of man he is? 
>> That's the kind of man he is. He's equally provocative at home as he has been abroad. 
>> Rose: What about the former nuclear negotiator? Is he going to run? 
>> He's running. I'm sure he's going to be accepted. 
>> Rose: Some say he's the ayatollah's favorite. 
>> He's probably going to be the ayatollah's favorite. It's between him and a man who used to be a foreign minister seasoned a now khomeini's foreign advisor. So it's between 
-- 
>> Rose: So they will choose between the two of them? 
>> I think they might both run and depending on how voters 
-- 
>> Rose: If there's a runoff 
-- 
>> right. But it's going to be very interesting because we're really for the first time seeing just infighting out in the open. 
>> Rose: Where are the moderates? 
>> The moderates 
-- 
>> Rose: Under house arrest? (Laughs) 
>> the moderates are under house arrest. The two leaders are in prison. That seems to be where most of the reformers are. In terms of voters I think that bringing rafsanjani in was actually very clever by the part of mr. Khamenei because it will excite voter base here. 
>> It brought anymore? 
>> Without his approval rafsanjani would not have come out. He's a cleric and he's by no means a reformer but he's more of a pragmatic person and i think that he will excite the voter base. He will bring the boycott crowd. The reformers who won't going to come. 
>> Rose: They will support him? They'll think he's better than the alternative? 
[00:25:09]



>> Exactly. 
>> Rose: Ands where the revolutionary guard? 
>> They have their hands in from oil wells to the telecommunication to anything. You name it, they have their hands there. What's happening, foreign policy? Syria, they run the show. Their candidate will be whoever khamenei sports. Homony. 
>> Rose:. 
>> Rose: Is there no link between the revolutionary guard and 
-- 
>> whoever becomes the president it went make a difference between iran's grander policies. The nuclear negotiations, talking to the u.S., What happens in syria. These are determined above the presidential level by the revolutionary guard and mr. Khomeini. 
>> Rose: One solution that fascinates me is qatar. 
>> Qatar and the saudi royal family have a rocky relationship going back many years and i think they realize the only way to maintain their independence, maintain their sovereignty is to really throw that money out there, buy the influence, whether it's financing the muslim brother heed part of the syrian revolution just to make sure they maintain 
-- 
>> no matter who wins they've got 
-- 
>> Rose: They've got a stake. 
>> And I think that explains it because otherwise, yes, it's the mystery of the modern world, a tiny country basically buying itself a big seat at the table. 
>> Rose: If someone said to you-- as I'm saying now-- so wither the arab spring. Who would you say? 
>> If you asked me that question two years ago I would have given a cautiously optimistic assessment. Today I'm much less optimistic. I see that the momentum that we saw, tunisia, egypt, libya has hid a brick wall in syria. And the whole sectarian issue-- which has always been out there but started in iraq following the american invasion-- has really come to the fore. And so you find this absurd situation where dipl dictatorships in the gulf say they're financing democracy in the rest of the world arab is laughable. And I think that's where the contradictions become obvious. Where is it going? God only knows. I think that we are at a historic turning point much like after the fall of the ottoman empire and the aftermath of world war i. I think all those artificial borders that were written up by the british and the french are evaporating or under threat at least. The differences in syria 
-- and I think that as the situation deteriorates in places like libya, places like egypt, places like tunisia I think there will be a secular backlash and there will be disillusionment with the islamist tendency which for decades enjoyed sort of a glow of purity. They were thought of as the people who were uncorruptible. Well, we've seen in places like egypt, in gaza where hamas runs that they are just as susceptible to the temptations of power and money as everybody else. 
[00:28:30]



>> Rose: No surprise there. 
>> And I think you're starting to see in egypt little glimmers of disillusionment with this and it may take years. So on the one hand you have to sectarian conflict. On the others, secular versus religious. It's getting very messy. 
>> But middle easterners have a long-term view. They have several thousands of years in history in most places so they see, I think, that ultimately it might be messy, as we've seen and experienced with the iranian revolution. And it might take decades to sort out but perhaps ultimately in the next00 years maybe the arab spring will be a good turning point because these countries need to go through islamists, they need to go through shifts and changes in order to come out 
-- 
>> Rose: A lot of blood 
-- 
>> 
-- differently. To have a democracy. 
>> They're going through their terrible twos. 
>> (Laughs) that's a good one. 
>> Rose: Finally this. Is the united stat relevant? 
>> I think that the arab spring has given a sense of empowerment and then they look at the places where the u.S. Intervene, like in iraq and affidavits. And they saw they left behind a mess and ten years on you still have sectarian problems in iraq, you still have car bombs blowing people up everywhere. And in some sense I thinkhat the u.S. Does is not as relevant as perhaps a decade ago because, you ow, people don't have as much stock in u.S. Foreign policy being able to improve things for them on the ground. There's a sense of disillusionment. 
>> Rose: Do you believe the iranians, if 
-- believe that the americans and the israelis or some combination thereof would attack if they thought iran was within months of having a nuclear capability? 
[00:30:31]



>> I think that they do. 
>> Rose: They do take that seriously? 
>> I think they take that very seriously and I think a lot of the crackdown inside iran, a lot of the positioning we see with iran positioning militarily, the military air shows that they have, the persian gulf presence that they've increased and even their involvement in syria i think is a signal to say that we are 
-- we are a force and if you me and attack us and mess with us we're gwing to put up a difficult fight. And you see in the past year or so as sort of the israel and the u.S. Officials have increased the rhetoric on iran, iranians have come back and pretty much regularly iranian media there are comments from security officials saying "we will attack u.S. Interests in iraq and in afghanistan." We will make america pay. So I think tha they do take it seriously charlie. This is the one big fear and i think this will more than the sanctions will force them to concede. I think the threat of the military strike and perhaps a threat of the regime somehow being upended is very real. 
>> Rose: Most of all they want to stay in power. 
>> Exactly. I think even if they are and i don't know about their nuclear program, but even if they want the know how I think it's more survival. 
>> Rose: This is so a cheap trick. What's the one question that you would most like to see answered in the middle east? What is it that you 
-- you know 
-- 
>> I think the thing that I find most vexing-- and we haven't touched on it-- is the arab 
-- the palestinian/israeli conflict. Why on earth can't this be sorted out? 
>> Rose: I do, too. 
>> It's gone on forever. 
>> Rose: It's in everybody's 
>> it's all about process, not about peace. And secretary kerry is pushing again. We see that he's very interested. 
[00:32:36]



>> Rose: Do you think that's reason to believe there can be movement? You? 
>> All other things being equal, no. No. I think that there doesn't seem to be on the israeli side much inclination to really sort of stop what they're doing and reconsider. 
>> Rose: You mean the settlements? 
>> Settlements. And the palestinians have no cards in their hands. THEY HAVE A BUNCH OF 2s. 
>> Rose: It's a pleasure to have you here. 
>> My pleasure. 
>> Rose: And you, good to see you again. 
>> Thank you. 
>> Rose: Back in a moment we'll talk about china and the united states. Stay with us. 
>> Rose: Before we turn to our next segment on china we have this interesting development. After the interview you are about to see took place, we heard from the white house that they have scheduled on june 7 and june 8 in california a bilateral meeting between the president of china and the president of the united states. Clearly what they will talk about are many of the things that we talk about in the interview you're about to see we did not know that meeting was going to take place until after we finished the interview and the two guests had left the building. Here is a conversation taked earlier today. The relationship between china, the united states is widely considered the most important bilateral relationship in the world. They are the world's largest economies and each of the second-largest trading partner. While there are significant economic opportunity there is's sizable challenges ahead for both. A new study charts a forward path. It's called "u.S.-China:2022, economic relations in the next ten years." Michael spence teaches at the n.Y.U. School of business. It was conceived by tung chee hwa. He was formerly chief executive of hong kong. I'm pleased to have them both at this table. Welcome. 
>> Thank you. 
>> Rose: So what's the genesis of this study? Is this you or michael? Or both? What did you think was necessary c.Snvplt 
[00:34:39]



>> what do I think is necessary here? I think we have had this economic relationship which started from being totally non-existent to becoming what it is today. A reasonably important economic relationship. 
>> Rose: Reasonably important it? That's what you would describe it as? Reasonably important? 
>> It's going to be 
-- 
>> Rose: Your report does not say "reasonably important." (Laughter) 
>> well, charlie, what we tried to do was look at that relationship, how often benefit each of us have received, united states or china, look at some of the difficulties that have arisen since the economic relationship becoming broader and deeper. You can almost say some of it would be inevitable. 
>> Rose: How would you measure the level of trust? 
>> And then in so far as the level of trust is concerned, think we need to look at it two ways. There are individual companies, both sides, who are unhappy with their treatment and therefore the trust is much less than what it is. But then if you look at the foreign direct investment going one way or going the other or the portfolio investment going one or the other, there's plenty of trust, you know? So my view is that on the whole things are moving well but the areas of discontent need to manage them, look at them, squarely face them. But most importantly to look at the future. Where is it going to be the next ten years. And that's what mainly we're trying to do. 
>> Rose: This is from the "new york times" today. May, 19, 2013, yesterday. "Three months after hackers working for a cyber unit of the chinese people's liberation army went silent amid evidence that they had from scores of american companies they appear to have resumed their attacks using different techniques according to computer industry security experts and american officials. The obama administration had bet that naming and shaming the groups first in industry reports and then in the pent develop's own detailed survey of chinese military capability might prompt china's new leadership to crack down on the military's highly organized team of hackers or at least urged them become more subtle." That's a problem. It's a problem when the united states believes that the most deep and pervasive spying against him, as well as hacking, come from china. 
[00:37:15]



>> I think, charlie, the chinese government and the military have time and again denied their involvement and emphasized that china herself is a victim to hacking andanting to work with the united states to find solution to this problem. China does not deny there are individuals in china who could be doing these things and we need to be getting on top of it. So from that point of view I'm pleased that during secretary kerry's visit in april to china there was extensive discussion on this subject and the fact is that in the strategic and economic dialogue there is going to be a special working group looking at this. They are meeting in july in washington and before that lots of preparation will go on. 
>> Rose: Michael, do you think this is enough? 
>> I think this is an issue we have to get under control bilaterally because it that has potential to contaminate the rest of the relationship on the business side, on the intergovernmental side. So I think c.H. Is right. The authorities on both sides are going to have to take it seriously. 
>> Rose: The report says it really is an urgent call to action. An imperative to act now. Why do you say that? 
>> Because both economies face very large challenges. They're different. But ours is out-of-bounds struggling to find a sustainable path of growth that deals with employment and the distribution, the last facts of our pattern of growth and the chinese have been 
-- 
>> Rose: And drawing down our debt. 
>> And drawing down our debt is part of that, for sure. Over a sensible time path so we don't kill the growth. And the chinese have made very substantial massive structural change coming in their economy. If it's $6,000 per capita income they aren't going to be the low-cost competitor in a number of industrys so that's just the trade in the economy. So what we believed after we spent some time with each other is that the old relationship is changing very fast and what we needed to do was to bilaterally understand the challenges in both economies and then go after the places where we can make a material positive difference. 
[00:39:55]



>> Rose: You once said to me that america understands china less than china understands america. 
>> Rose: 
>> China do not understand america well enough. And I always make the point america understands china even less. As a result of this, you know, the mistrust goes both ways. But the relationship is now so important. Both countries the leaders of both countries understand this we need to really work on this issue. We need to work on this issue. And we almost have to start from the bottom, you know? There are now 130,000 chinese students in america. I think it's a wonderful thing. The two administrations agree that there should be over the next five years hundred thousand american students in china. Which we hope we can achieve those targets. And then on top of that the business to business thing we're talking about, these the areas where really trust building can 
-- 
>> Rose: Three areas: Science and technology, trade in additions and rebuilding a u.S. Infrastructure in which chinese investors can provide funding. 
>> Yes. 
>> Rose: That's possible? All of that have? 
>> Yes. 
>> Absolutely. 
>> Rose: When you look at your relationship 
-- 
>> charlie, there's one other piece. The estimates of the chinese middle-class is that there are 230 million rising to 630 million 
-- 
>> Rose: By 2022. 
>> Yeah. This is a gigantic market. 
>> Rose: For everybody. 
>> Including us. 
>> Rose: You know, the rise in middle-class in china is a net plus for everybody because it provides a market and will enable china to turn its economy from an exporting model to a domestic consumption model. That part of the five-year plan, how is it going? 
[00:41:56]



>> Well, it's already started. 
>> Rose: Right. 
>> It's going. The first year seemed to be going well. I think you know, if you look at all these five-year plans and this next one coming, 7.5% growth, the challenges are many, many the restructuring of the economy is a huge task. If you look at the last 30 years, the chinese government has gone through much more difficult challenges. Challenges all the time. They succeeded in the past and i have to believe they will succeed. But europe is staggering. But I think we would be able to manage it. But charlie, let me say this on this middle-class issue here, the number of things which is very important to notice is that china in the next ten years will be the largest importing nation of american goods we will replace canada as number one importing american goods because of the potential of consumption. And that's one. The other is that there are firms in china like wal-mart, like general motors, they're all at the top end of the market share anyway. Think of the benefit they will have because of the growth of the middle-class in china and then on top of that I think it's not just multinationals. What we need to be doing for both countries, how do we get a median small-sized businesses to get involved in this economic activity? And that may be through the likes of ali be be or amazon or something. We need to be thinking about these things so that it not just goes to the multinationals but to people all over the place. 
[00:44:05]



>> Rose: I'm told that china is lessening the advantages of state-controlled enterprises. Much to the pleasure of non--state enterprises in china. Is that true? 
>> Well, the chinese state-owned enterprises 
-- 
>> Rose: Have huge advantages. 
>> Have huge advantages. They have 
-- they have essentially controlled state-owned enterprises and local controlled state-owned enterprises accounting for 35% to 40% of the economy. It has declined quite a lot. So the private sector has now gone up to about 60% of the economy and this will continue to be the trend growing. 
>> Rose: Let me interrupt you. If that continues, how will it change china? 
>> You know, the key part of 
-- so the state-owned enterprises probably won't be privatized any time soon, but they will be subjected to competition. 
>> Rose: Right. 
>> And the competition will increase the innovator in the economy. So china's economy 
-- this is just a crucial component of innovation anyway, charlie. So the chinese economy will start to generate important innovations that then drive not only that economy but get shared in the way innovations always die do. 
>> Rose: You were advising a standing committee-- and maybe you do-- what should they be worried about? Where is 
-- where are the land mines for china? 
>> The one that worries me the most-- and I think some of the policymakers there-- is not the supply-side. Because it's a flexible, dynamic economy. It's the demand side. This is an economy in which household income is below 60% of national income and the savings rate is 30%. So that's an economy where most of the estimates of consumption are below 40%. Now 
-- 
>> Rose: Is the savings rate 30% because there is no social safety net? 
[00:46:07]



>> In part. And there may be a cultural element. 
>> Rose: Cultural, too. 
>> So this is not going to work if you want to build a big domestic market really quickly. Now, I'm not saying anything the policymakers-- and a lot of smart people there-- don't already know. But transforming the demand side of the economy fast enough to generate this domestic 
-- 
>> Rose: How do they do that? 
>> Well, they've got to move the income around. Now, they've got a tail wind, charlie. 
>> Rose: Redistribute it? 
>> Partly that, but the wages are going up. 
>> Rose: And if wages go up, what 
-- what's the threat of that in terms of china? If wages rise 
-- 
>> if wages rise without productivity you have inflation and this is where the challenges are over the last five years the wages have doubled. Over the next ten years wages will be doubled again, okay? So five the last five years inflation seems to be under control. Now the next five years, let's see what happens. This is the plan. 
>> Rose: China has a huge investment in africa. China wants its voice to be heard. We heard that from xi jinping said in the speeches at the time of his taking the presidency. Did we not? 
>> Yes. But, charlie, you know 
-- 
>> Rose: He says that to the company, "charlie, you know --" 
>> 600 years ago when ming dynasty was in china, china had 30% of the g.D.P. Of the world. 
>> Rose:30%? 30% of the g.D.P. Of the world. The center of the world. But china never tried to flex its muscles overseas. They did send fleets of ships all over the place, but always for trading and so on so forth. Never take 
-- never took territories. 
>> Rose: It was not imperialistic. 
[00:48:07]



>> They're not imperialistic. 
>> Rose: Take these three issues: Cyber security which is a big issue and recognized by both governments. Intellectual property protection. Is there progress there? 
>> Yes, I believe there's progress there. For a number of reasons, the chinese authorities are taking it seriously and, two, there's domestic intellectual property being produced that will require protection. 
>> So in other words 
-- 
>> Rose: The other thing that comes up with respect to 
-- with respect to the 
-- china's attitude about us is that some people you talk to in china believe that the united states wants to contain them. Is that a deep feeling? Is that a feeling of the leadership? Or is that a feeling of sort of the population in general? 
>> I think they are 
-- like in every other country they always 
-- there are always groups of people who believe certain things. There are certain people in china who believe america is out there to contain china. 
>> Rose: Do you think that's the view of the military leadership? 
>> Not necessarily. Maybe. But I want to tell you that this 
-- it happens, for instance, when you say I'm coming back to the pacific and that 
-- so people read this, why are you coming back to the pacific? You're trying to contain china? I think there is this sort of feeling on the other hand that the two leaders of the two countries and the senior government officials of the two countries, they are talking with each other a great deal but they understand each other very well. I think that is important, you know? And we need to keep on talking to each other and making sure that the proper messages are out there. 
[00:50:11]



>> Rose: Other than the president and the secretary of state, who do you think is the principal official in the u.S. Government who has the "china card"? Is it tom donelan? 
>> I think, you know, 
-- you would be surprised over the last four years of 
-- the last administration. I ministerial level meetings, there were 63 ministerial level meetings. 
>> Rose: Including national security? 
>> Including national security. 
>> Rose: Especially national security. 
>> There were many, many of them. And now you know, for instance, that the minister in charge of climate change, he is very much involving direct dialogue with administration here. The science and technology minister directly involving dialogue. They're all over the place. 
>> Rose: That's an interesting question in terms of those kinds of issues that are across the spectrum of anybody who is a big player in the world today it is the ability to deal with those issues that transcend national borders. Like environmental issues, like climate change. 
>> Absolutely. 
>> Rose: Is china prepared-- and we might ask are we we prepared-- to have a common mission? To do something about those issues because of the power of the two countries? 
>> Can I just say this to you, what I learned recently? You know, china, united states, we are the two largest producers of energy and consumers of energy. We are also the two largest emitter of greenhouse gases, okay? So we just have to work together to improve energy efficiency, to use more renewable energy, less carbon. We need 
-- we just need to do all these things if we are going to solve the overall problem. And there is now a real desire, I believe, on both governments to do this. Now very little notice but, again, secretary kerry was in china in april. There were discussions on this subject. At the end of the discussion there was a joint committee that was issued on this particular surgeon general about energy, about climate change, committing to work together to move forward together and put this on the july agenda. 
[00:52:50]



>> Rose: Stephen colbert made a graduation 
-- commencement speech over the weekend at the university of virginia and as you may have noted, he said with a sense of humor, said to them "you owe a lot not to your parents but to china." As a reflection of the u.S. Debt. What role does that play in terms of the relationship between the two countries? 
>> Well, from my point of view it's relatively small. I was going to mention before, treasury is a very important player in these bilateral discussions because of the international monetary system, exchange rates and capital flows I don't have any doubt that the chinese holdings go along with the perception that the responsible management of these is terribly important both for the united states but also china. This is almost mutually certain destruction if you mismanage it. So it's true that it's a gigantic amount of money. 
>> Rose: It is! Are they slowly trying to reduce the amount of the debt that they hold of american debt? 
>> I think it's not a slowly trying to reduce but what is going to happen is that that as the world trade increases some part of the world trade will be done in currencies other than u.S. Dollars. 
>> Rose: Right. 
>> And this sort of thing could happen. This sort of thing could happen. 
>> It also moves into riskier asset, charlie. They don't have to hold us in sovereign debt. 
>> Rose: Like what would they move into? 
>> Equities, infrastructure. 
>> Rose: Okay, right. 
>> Foreign direct investment. 
>> Rose: I wondered how much risk you were talking about. 
>> But, you know, charlie, i will say this to you that the future is so much bound together BETWEEN TWOeOUNTRIES AND FOR America, shell gas is a guam changer. You happened to restore fiscal discipline. I think the current account deficit will be gradually under order. And this is 
-- really, this 
-- i hope I'm not talking out of tune. I think this is a game changer for you. 
[00:55:19]



>> Rose: Yeah, well, you're not the only foreign say that. Americans say that as well as others. This report is called "u.S.-China economic relations in the next ten years: Towards deeper engagement and mutual benefits." Thank you. Good to see you. 
>> Thank you. 
>> Rose: Michael, thank you thank you for joining us. See you next time.

Ha ha ha ha ha! I think I've got it! No, no, I've got it! I've got it! 
[00:02:16]


[Gasps] hey, you said you had it, cleo. Sorry, t. B-b-but look. Ruff! Ruff! Ruff! Ruff! Ruff! What is she wearing? I can't believe she went out in public like that. What is that thing anyway? It's no big deal. It's just a cone collar. They help to keep you from scratching so that a sore, itchy spot can get better. Well, it's her own fault then. She wouldn't be wearing that awful thing if she hadn't scratched so much. Uh-huh. If I ever found out I might have to wear one of those things, I'd stop scratching completely. I'd do anything to keep from wearing one of those. I mean, just look at her. That's really sad. [Sighs] it is sad, isn't it? I'm glad it'll never happen to me. Or me. I think it could happen to any of us. [Laughs] oh, no. I would control myself and just stop scratching. Me, too. ?????? Ooh dum dee dum do do do do do ?????? I think we should stop talkin' about itching and get back to playing. Come on, you guys. Let's go play. I win! I win! [Sighs] you always win when we race, clifford. Let's play something else now. Oh! How about de-and-seek? I'll be it! You guys go hide! Ok! Let's go! 1, 2-- what's the matter, cleo? Do you have an itchy spot? Oh, uh, itchy spot? Me? 
[00:04:34]


[Laughs] no, no, no, no, no. Don't be silly. I was just--i--i-- uh, checking my paw. Well, looks great. Gotta hide now. Bye. 1, 2... 3, 4, 5! Ready or not, here I come! Ah-ah... Ah-choo! Hooray for me! It's clifford I see! Hooray for me! It's mac I see! Hooray for me! It's cleo I see! Cleo? Are you ok? T-bone, you found cleo. I know that. But cleo doesn't seem to know it yet. Cleo? Cleo? Cleo? Cleo? Cleo? Cleo? Uh, heh heh. Uh, hooray for t-bone! He--he found me. Cleo, do you have... An itch? A-a-a-an itch? No, no, no, no, no. Uh, I was just, you know, heh, knockin' the leaves out of my fur. Heh. Ow! There's a big red spot behind your ear, cleo. You'd better stop scratching, cleo, or you're going to end up in a cone. A cone? Y-y-you mean, like the one that other dog was wearing? I can't wear a cone! It'd be too awful! Oh, then just stop scratching. I will! I--i--i mean, I won't. I--i--i mean, I will stop, and I won't scratch. Good for you. You're strong enough to control yourself. Right. I'm not sure you can make yourself stop. When you have an itch, you scratch. You should go see dr. Dihn, cleo. She can help make your itch go away completely. I don't need it to go away. I just need to stop scratching, and everything will be fine. Uh-uh-uh. Unh! Right. Stop scratching. Well, it's almost time to pick up emily elizabeth from school. I'll see you guys tomorrow. Good luck with the not scratching, cleo. Thanks, big guy. I am ready for some serious diggin' today, clifford. Me, too. I can't wait to feel the dirt moving beneath my paws. Look, there's cleo. 
[00:07:46]


Clifford: I hope she's in the mood to do some digging, too. Cleo's always in the mood for diggin'. Hey, cleo. Cleo. Uh, cleo's not here. Cleo, it's us. Clifford and t-bone. Come on out. Uh-uh. Then we'll come to you. No! Are you ok, cleo? I'm ok. I'm just kind of busy right now. I'm, um, uh, counting my squeak-toys, and, um-- oh, I just lost my place. I guess I'll have to start over. We could help you. No! I mean, this could take all afternoon. I have a lot of squeak-toys, you know. You guys go on ahead and dig without me. Hmm. Uh, cleo? Are you wearing a cone? Uh-huh. I look terrible, don't i? No. Not at all. I tried to stop scratching, but I just couldn't. You were right, clifford. When you have an itch, you have to scratch. I'll bet that dog yesterday tried really hard not to scratch, too, and I bet she was really glad when she finally got to see dr. Dihn and got some help make the itching stop. Is that what happened to you? Uh-huh. Now I feel terrible that I was staring at that other dog and saying she looked awful. It's hard to really know what another dog is going through unless you go through it yourself. Is the cone as bad as you thought it would be, cleo? No. It's just kind of hard to run and play the way I'm used to doing. Well, maybe you have to try running and playing in different ways. Right! Let's try playing ball. 
[00:09:58]


[Squeak] I said I had a lot of squeak-toys. Here it comes! Ohh! Hey--uhh! Well, that didn't work very well. Try again. You'll get the hang of it. Nose it over here, cleo. Ok. Here goes. All right, cleo! Yes! Ruff! Throw it to me again! Uhh--whoa! Ha ha ha ha ha! I've got it! I've got it! Whoa--uhh! I've got it! Ok, t-bone. Throw it back. Right in the old cone-basket. Look at that ball go. Heh heh heh heh. [Bonk] uhh. [Gasps] mac? Cleo! You've got a cone. Uh-huh. And you're out in public. Yes, mac. I am wearing a cone in public. I had an itch I couldn't stop scratching, so dr. Dihn put it on to help me get better. Now, if you've got a problem with that, you can just go and play with somebody else. Ok? Well, i-- I mean, you-- I mean-- do you want to play with me or not? [Sighs] yes. I want to play with you. Hee hee. Good. Then let's plaaaay ball! Over here! I've got it! Throw it to me! Heh. Got an itch, mac? Don't worry about a thing. You're gonna look great in a cone. 
[00:12:34]


Emily Elizabeth: Clifford! It's story time. You want to hear a speckle story, don't you? Ruff! Ruff! Heh heh. I thought so. He's your favorite. Today's story is speckle and the slumber party. "It was nighttime at speckle's slumber party, "and everyone was ready for bed, "but ravi couldn't fall asleep. "He was afraid of the dark. "Well, everyone knew what that felt like, "so, speckle lent ravi his special teddy bear "to keep him company throughout the night. "Darnell shared his favorite blue blanket. "Luna offered her snuggly stuffed doll. "Reba even put her night light right by ravi. "Snuggling with his friends' gifts, "ravi felt wonderful and ready to sleep, "but now no one else could sleep. "They missed their bedtime buddies. "Then ravi said there was enough room under his blanket "for everybody, "so, they all piled in together, "and with their bedtime buddies close by, "and with the bright, full moon shining on them through the window, "the gang happily fell asleep. The end." That was a great story. Isn't reading fun? Ruff! Heh heh. Oh, mr. Bleakman. Thank you so much for your help. Those flowers are just what I needed to make my annual garden party perfect. Oh, there's nothing prettier than a perfectly planted petuni yeah! [Slurps] yum. Chocolate. No, no, cosmo. If you lick all the batter, there won't be any cake. The guys with the extra tables and chairs are here, mom. Oh, good. I'd better go talk to them. No, cosmo, not the flowers. Yeah. Pretty. Oh, cosmo. We're gonna have to call a sitter for you, or I am never gonna be ready for this party. You don't need to call a sitter, mom. I can watch cosmo for you. Oh, I don't know, jetta. He's quite a handful. I can do it, mom. Besides, you'll be right here if I needou. Well, all right, dear. Call me if you need help. Don't worry, mom. Cosmo and I are gonna have lots of fun. 
[00:15:25]


[Laughs] come on, cosmo. Let's go play. [Cosmo laughs] Cosmo: Good horsey. Horsey, go! Horsey, go! [Sighs] [gurgles] again! Uhh. Wasn't that fun, cosmo? Again! Again! Again! Again! Again! Again! Mrs. Handover: Is everything all right, jetta? Yes, mom! Everything's great! Hi, jetta. Woof! Ruff! Hi, guys. I'm sorry I can't play today. I'm watching my brother while my mom gets ready for her party. Would you like some help, jetta? We love playing with cosmo. Uh, no, thanks. I can handle it. Oh! Again! Again! Again! [Sighs] ok. Here we go again. Jetta, maybe you could try and get cosmo to do something quiet to calm him down a little. Like read a book, or something. He's too young to read. Again! Again! Besides, cosmo needs action. Yeah! Well, clifford can't read either, but he loves it when I read to him. I'm as active as cosmo, and I love it when my dad reads to me. [Cosmo giggles] [groans] ok. It's worth a try. Let's read cosmo a book. Here's a good one. Far-flung fairy tales from far off lands. There are tales from africa, asia, europe. This one's called the shell boy. 
[00:17:36]


Cosmo: Cosmo! I think we have a winner. Emily Elizabeth: "Long, long ago "and far, far away, there lived a poor fisherman and his wife." I am so hungry. I hope my husband returns soon with lots of fish from the sea to eat. [Boat approaches] [sighs] here he is now. Oops. Sorry, wife, but I have returned from the sea with my catch at last. I hope you caught lots of fish. I'm starving. I'm starving, too. Look! A treasure chest. Maybe it's full of fish. Nope. No fish. Wait. [Sighs] look, a clam. Great. I'll make us clam chowder. Manhattan or new england? Hello, mother! What is it, wife? It's a boy. A real boy. Well, we can't eat that. Wait! Whoa! Whoa-oh-oh! What? Don't you see, husband? We've been blessed with a son. Hi, daddy. He is kind of cute. He's our own little shell boy. Shell boy? He needs a more distinguished name that that. Ok. How about fisherman phineas flounder's one and only amazing abalone seashell boy from the lost lagoon? Not bad. That's a name that will take him far. Emily Elizabeth: "And the fisherman and his wife "came to love the little shell boy very much. "It wasn't long before the little fellow grew up "into the bravest and strongest young man on the island, ready to head out into the world to seek his fortune." More, emily elizabeth! More! More! "So, fisherman phineas flounder's "one and only amazing abalone seashell boy from the lost lagoon "set out. "He went to a small village in the heart of the island "and entered the shop of the local shoemaker, ready to make his fortune as a shoemaker's helper." Um, you're not an elf by any chance, are you? I don't hire elves anymore. I am fisherman phineas flounder's one and only amazing abalone seashell boy from the lost lagoon. It's a name that will take me far. 
[00:20:24]


[Snoring] hey! Um, sorry. Does that mean you're not an elf? Uh, yes. Yes, you are an elf? No. No, you're not an elf? Yes. Yes, you are an elf? Look, do I get the job or not? You look like an honest kid. Ok, you're hired. Yes! How much do you pay? Pay? I never paid the elves. What? Oh, I suppose I could pay you on commission, although we do have major cash flow problems. Mind if I pay you in shoelaces? Aw, forget it. Emily Elizabeth: "So, fisherman phineas flounder's "one and only amazing abalone seashell boy "from the lost lagoon "left the shoemaker's shop, "and once again, he set out to seek his fortune. "This time, his quest led him to the castle of the grumpy old giant." Whoa. Grumpy giant! Oh, wow. Look at that. There's nothing prettier than a perfectly planted petunia. Fee, flea, a cup of tea, I hate soup, and soup hates me. Hey, uh, mr. Giant. Huh? Down here! Ohh! Go away and stop tugging my pants. Wait! Wait, mr. Giant! Please, uh, I want to talk to you. Huh? Whoa! [Coughs] are you still here? Excuse me for noticing, mr. Giant, sir, but, you know, you seem a little grumpy. Well...! I can't help it. I didn't have my nap today. Oh, I get grumpy when I miss my nap, too. 
[00:22:34]


[Sighs] I used to go to sleep to the sound of my magical, musical sleepy-bye mobile, but the batteries ran down. I knew I should've bought rechargeables. [Mobile plays slowly] ok, ok, ok, I get it! Just make it stop! You know, uh, you're kind of nice. Are you an elf? No, I am not an elf. So, who are you? I am fisherman phineas flounder's one and only amazing abalone seashell boy from the lost lagoon. [Yawns] that's quite a name. Makes me kind of sleepy just to hear it. What is it again? I am fisherman phineas flounder's one and only amazing abalone seashell boy from the lost lagoon. [Snoring] [WHISPERS] It's a name that will take me far. Emily Elizabeth: "The shell boy's long name "put that giant right to sleep, "and the giant was so grateful "for the good and restful sleep, "that when he woke up, he gave the shell boy "a wondrous, giant chicken "that laid eggs of the purest gold. "So, the fisherman's wife was right. "The name fisherman phineas flounder's "one and only amazing abalone seashell boy from the lost lagoon "did take the shell boy far. The end." Well, look at this. You've done a great job of looking after cosmo, jetta. Thank you. Oh, it wasn't hard, mom. Especially after emily elizabeth and charlie came to help. I'll take cosmo now, so you kids can play. Uhh! No go! No go! More stories. Yeah! Yeah it's ok, mom. He can stay here. We all want to hear another story. Woof! Well, ok, honey. What story would you like to hear now, cosmo? Cosmo want shell boy again. Again? Now jetta read shell boy... Please? Oh, ok. Shell boy it is... Again. 
[00:24:52]

This must be clifford's new toy. Let's see what it can do. I don't know, cleo. That toy isn't ours. It's clifford's. I don't think we should use it without asking him first. How would you feel if someone used your favorite toy without asking first? Hmm. I wouldn't like it. Ok. I'll wait till clifford comes back and ask if I can use it. Hi, guys. Hi, clifford. We came to see if you could play and saw your cool new toy. Can we play with it? Sure. Thanks for asking, cleo.

>>> Continuing to rain and thunder and lightning here is making it a miserable day in moore for the rescuers and searchers who are out there combing through the rubble trying to find anyone who is still missing. Chad myers, give us an overview of what the weather is like and what it will be like for the next 24 hours. 
>> It will get better for you. There is still a little lightning in your area. I'll show you where the lightning strike was. It wasn't far from you. Most of the weather will be down south towards shreveport and little rock today. Oklahoma city there is moore. The lightning strike was about four miles to the next northwest of you. The northern part of central texas. Other than that we are about done for where you are at this point. The u.S. Has more tornadoes than any other part of the world, cold air in the mountains, a warm gulf of mexico and dry air out of the mountains. Let me show you this picture yesterday at about 3:40 local time. Here is oklahoma city. Here is the debris ball, the debris in the air that the radar was seeing thinking it could be rain. We looked at it and we knew it wasn't rain but it was debris from the tornado. We are going to put this into three dimensions. You can see 17,000 feet, the debris flying through the air circulating around the tornado and falling back to earth due to gravity. An amazing shot of what this tornado looked at. We are not looking at hail or rain. We are looking at debris in the air as it was sucked into the sky. We had reports yesterday in tulsa that they were finding post cards and pictures from this tornado almost 100 miles away, things getting sucked out of the storm into the sky and blown down wind 100 miles. 
[00:05:19]



>> And that debris, it is so dangerous, so deadly. Here is a bowling ball, one of the many bowling balls laying around here from this bowling alley. You can imagine what would happen with this being picked up by the storm. An emotional moment involving navy reservists in the middle of the debris with an american flag. We'll show you that ahead. 
>>> I had to hold on to the wall to keep myself safe because i didn't want to fly away in the tornado. 
>> We had to pull a car out of the front hallway off a teacher. I don't know what that lady's name is but she had three little kids underneath her. Truth is, over sixty percent of America shops at Walmart every month. I find what I need, at a great price. And the money I save goes to important things. Braces for my daughter. A little something for my son's college fund. When people look at me, I hope they see someone building a better life. VO: Living better: That's the real walmart. ] advisors process, it's easy to follow the progress you're making toward all your financial goals. A quick glance, and you can see if you're on track.

>>> You can find all sorts of items and possessions amidst the debris. Some are personal possessions that can bring hope or joy to an individual or family. Some are personal possessions. Ta a look what navy reservists found last night amidst the debris. 
>>> I'm anderson cooper live in moore, oklahoma. Just behind me what is left of a bowling alley, one of the buildings that stood in the way of the tornado. Rescue teams are digging through the rubble. The fire chief spoke about this rescue operation. 
>> We made it through I will say most of the structures, most of the homes. The ones that we didn't make it through yesterday we will make it through today. We will be through every damaged piece of property in this city at least three times before we are done. And we hope to be done by dark tonight. 
>> At least 24 people including nine children were killed here. Rescuers are not giving up hope, not by a long shot. They will go through things three times. So far more than 100 people have been found alive amidst the acres of destruction. That is an incredible number. More than 100 people found aalive. President obama spoke a short time ago pledging urgent government help for what he is calling one of the most destructive storms in the nation's history. 
[00:10:37]



>> We don't know the full extent of the damage from this week's storm. We don't know the human and economic losses that may have occurred. We know that severe rumblings of weather, bad weather through much of the country still continues and we're also preparing for hurricane season that begins next week. 
>> More coming to us. The devastation two miles wide. One I reporter captured the terror from the ground. Take a look. Learned national weather service says the peak wind speed was 190 miles per ur. Once it hit the sheer size of this tornado ripped up everything in its path, buildings, home. You can see the debris whipping around the car in the video. It is incredible there. Our john king is in a different part of moore. He has been talking to survivors all day long. What have you been hearing from people? 
>> I understand it is remarkable. I was in the early morning hours when it was pitch back. Residents were not allowed then. Residents have come back today. The family who lives here was back a short time ago trying to find anything. You see the random things left behind. You look this way I can see completely devastated. You can see this kitchen. Families have started to come back. We are about three quarters of a mile from here and we met an elderly woman who says she tried to come back and was turned away. Most important when she tried last night and there today to try to find her beloved jackson, boo, her dog. 
[00:12:56]



>> The only thing I lost is my dog. 
>> Dog and a cat? 
>> Yeah. 
>> And the dog was a present from my kids for mother's day. 
>> It was on top of my bed. 
>> What were you able to get out? 
>> We found some jewelry. He is just digging around. I told him we have to stack it until it dries up and we can get cars where my other kids can help get it out. 
>> Renee myers told us her dog would stay in a kennel. He is capable of kicking the door open. She said the dog would run to the door when she gets home from work. Her son was sifting through the rubble. He got to a point where he couldn't move heavy things. I went in to help him. We managed to move heavy debris and we found the kennel. It was the first time she said she smiled because the kennel was empty and the door was open. The wreckage was everywhere. There is a distinct possibility her dog passed away and is buried in the wreckage. Because it was open she had some hope that after she left for cover she was unable to get her dog because she was leaving for the school she was working she was hopeful boo escaped and was looking through the neighborer health department hoping to find him as many residents are. 
>> We saw a video of an elderly lady who did find her dog alive in the rubble while she was being interviewed. Are people staying with friends or at a shelter? 
>> She stayed with her son. He lives in norman. He lost his home in the big tornado back in 1999. Some stayed in shelters. When I got in last night I was at one local church. There was a very fitting sign out front. They put signs. You drive by them every day. It said when you have had enough and you have had more than you can stand, kneel. There were some people stay in that church. Some went to shelters. Many went to families. The first thing they tried to do at day break 
-- people were trying to get back in the neighborhood and the authorities wouldn't let them. Today as they try to come back and the weather stopped raining at the moment, the weather complicating what is obviously a very, very difficult day for people as they get back. Anderson you have been talking about it all day and you saw it last night. Many went through it in 1999. They are going through it again today. They are resilient and their community has pulled together remarkably. Even though it looks like this most people we have met say they want to stay and they want to rebuild. 
[00:15:56]



>> We have heard that time and time again. I appreciate it. As the tornado descended on this city of moore, people only had a few minutes, up to 16 minutes to figure out whether to get in their vehicles and try to outrun it or hunker down where they were and get to a storm shelter if they had it or their bathrooms. A lot of people took incredible video capturing the storm's terrifying size. Take a look at this. 
>> Please, dear god. Very large and deadly tornado. Kevin, get the pictures, man. I'm getting the video. I have never heard a roar like that before. It's going just to our north. Very large heading into moore, oklahoma. Hold on. It is going to our north. We're completely fine. 
>> Get in the car. Get in the car. 
>> I'll jump in when you guys are ready. We need to go. We need to go. We have lots of debris coming down. Go north back behind it. 
[00:18:04]



>> Going back through the debris field. 
>> This is the damage path right now. Houses are completely levelled. 
>> It is unrecognizable. 
>> Houses are levelled. 
>> This doesn't look like it was ever a development. 
>> It doesn't. 
>> This 
-- >>o my god, guys. 
>> Look at those people. We have to help them. 
>> Pul over right here. This is like a daycare or school or something. Look at all of the kids. 
>> It is so hard to believe. There is a strange silence here today. You hear generators and trucks backing up. You hear heavy earth moving equipment kind of moving some debris, people walk by having quiet conversations. But there is a silence. It's almost like a stunned silence. A lot of people kind of standing around. Some are taking pictures. Some shaking their heads. They don't know exactly what to do or where to go. What step to take first. If you want to help more oklahoma you can visit our impact your world pag at cnn.Com/impact. We will have more from a nearby neighborhood. John king is in a neighborhood and stephanie elam is in another one. your... type? A or B positive?? Have you eaten today? I had some Lebanese food for lunch. I love the Lebanese. I... I'm not sure.

>>> Welcome back to moore, oklahoma. The cleanup is going to be long and hard here in moore. There is going to be a lot of hard days ahead, a lot of hard weeks. Piles of debris, homes scattered for miles really. You can see the destruction in all directions. Our stephanie elam is in one of the neighborhoods that took a direct hit. Some of the things you have been seeing throughout the day, people, I always wonder what is the first step that people take to try to start to rebuild? 
>> Reporter: It's unbelievable what these people are coming in and finding, anderson. A lot of them are finding out that most of the walls of their homes are gone. We did find one shelter here that would have been underneath their car but they were at work. They would have been in here but they were in here. Look what happened. If you look at where I'm standing their entire garage blew away. The entire foundation is gone. They came back. This couple got married in august. Her wedding dress was gone. Many things were gone including their dog. This is sugar. They are looking for their dog, sugar. This is the story of a lot of people out here where they are looking for their loved ones and a lot of times it means the furry ones. People calling for their animals hoping that they can find some ort of idea of where they could have gone. It is very heartbreaking for a lot of these people. 
>> No doubt about it. People are trying to really pick up the pieces as best they can, take whatever they can find and then they are going to stay somewhere else. One of the things you keep seeing and it takes time for your eyes to adjust to what you are seeing. You look at something and try to piece together what it is. I took pictures of some vehicles that are just actually about a block or so from where I am standing right now. Vehicles, that vehicle has been totally crushed. That is another one that has been completely crushed there. A couple of these vehicles are like fused together. They have been slammed together with such force they have melded into each other. At plaza towers elementary which we have been focusing on about 70 students and staff members road out the storm. At least seven of those killed in the tornado were students there. Emergency personnel continue to scour the rubble of the elementary school. Students were days away from summer vacation. Brier wood elementary you can hear the chaos as parents and teachers search for their children. 
[00:26:01]



>> Where is she? She's out? Okay. 
>> All fifth graders right here. 
>> Step over the wires. Fifth graders. 
>> Everyone at that school has been accounted for. Everyone. Up next, the mayor says he is optimistic they are going to find more people in the rubble. Brian todd has new information as cnn's special live coverage. We will be right back. 
>> His teacher is in the hospital. His teacher saved his life. 
>> Who is his teacher? 
>> I have no doubt they lifted a wall off of these kids, several kids. 
>> Was there a wall on your son? 
[ Male Announcer ] ALONG WITH SUPPORT, Chantix (varenicline) is proven to help people quit smoking. It reduces the urge to smoke. It put me at ease that you could smoke on the first week. 
[ Male Announcer ] SOME PEOPLE HAD CHANGES In behavior, thinking or mood, hostility, agitation, depressed mood and suicidal thoughts or actions while taking or after stopping chantix. If you notice y of these stop taking chantix and call your doctor right away. Tell your doctor about any history of depression or other mental health problems, which could get worse while taking chantix. Don't take chantix if you've had a serious aergic or skin reaction to it. If you develop these stop taking chantix and see your doctor right away as some can be life-threatening. Tell your doctor if you have a history of heart or blood vessel problems, or if you develop new or worse symptoms. Get medical help right away if you have symptoms of a heart attack or stroke. Use caution when driving or operating machinery. Common side effects include nausea, trouble sleeping and unusual dreams. With chantix and with the support system it worked for me.

>>> welcome back here. We are live in moore, oklahoma. There has been a lot of confusion over the last many hours over the death toll. Last night state medical examiner told me on the air that the death toll was about 40 or so. That has been downgraded. Now they are sayg 24 is the confirmed death toll. Brian todd was at a press conference a short time ago with an update on rescue efforts. What is the latest on how rescue efforts are going? 
>> Reporter: They do still consider this a rescue effort and not a recovery effort just yet. Much of this is still a rescue effort. One of the officials, the fire chief of moore told us a short time ago that they are going through every single piece of damaged property at least three times. And they haven't finished doing that yet. They are sending dog teams in. They are sending all sorts of specialists into every house searching every damaged house and building at least three times looking for survivors. This still very much a rescue effort and not just a recovery effort. You mentioned the death toll that was revised down this afternoon to 24 at the moment. Nine of them children. Seven of the nine were in that plaza tower elementary school that was levelled. The figures are the latest we know about casualties from this tornado. Another significant piece of information that has come up this afternoon at this news conference, the police chief of oklahoma city at one point overnight last night and into this morning they had about 48 people reported missing but the police chief said right now just about all of them have been accounted for except he said a few people in moore. There may be a few people in this town that was so hard hit by the tornado who are still missing but that figure revised down, as well. 
>> So we may not know this because there is confusion about locations of people, all of the kids woo were at that elementary school that has been the focus, have they all been accounted for or are there still some missing? 
[00:33:01]



>> They are still searching around that area of the elementary school from what they tell us. As far as all of the children being accounted for from that school they are giving indications that all of them have been accounted for but again they are still searching. They a hedging it a little bit. They want to make sure that they have combed through every piece of debris, every pocket of debris. As you know you have been in haiti. You have been in japan. In these situations after earthquakes and hurricanes and tornadoes you have crevices in buildings and among rubble that you think there is nothing there, where they may be a pocket where someone could be possibly alive. They are still sending in k-9 teams. We were in a very devastated area of town a short time ago. They still have search and rescue dog teams combing through there. They are using infrared to get through structures and vehicles that are damaged heavily. Still very much an on going rescue operation. As far as accounting for people they say just about everybody has been accounted for. They are saying not until we go through every piece of damaged property at least three times. 
>> I understand it's important to be as thorough as possible in searching things three times. The weather has let up here. That is a little bit more good news. The rain and lightning and thunder has stopped. That will make the rest of the day light hours a little easier. Dr. Sanjay gupta will join us live next and what kind off urgent care is needed. Our special coverage continues in a moment. people question: How old is the oldest person you've known? We gave people a sticker and had them show us. We learned a lot of us have known someone who's lived well into their 90s. And that's a great thing. But even though we're living longer, one thing that hasn't changed much is the official retirement age. ??? ??? the question is how do you make sure you have the money you need to enjoy all of these years. ??? ??? go school, you deserve more than just flexibility and convenience.

[00:37:57]



>>> I'm anderson cooper live in moore, oklahoma. You can see what the moore medical center looked like a little more than 24 hours ago. Today the hospital building is half of what it used to be. It is unrecognizable from what it is on the website. It took a direct hit. No one was killed inside which is incredible. Look at the structure. E front of it, the facade has been stripped away. Two story building is now just one story. No one can be inside at this point. Three other area hospitals have had to step in. Our chief medical correspond, dr. Sanjay gupta joins me now. You don't hear about hospitals getting direct hit. 
>> We have heard about it twice, in joplin the hospital was in the path of the storm. It is remarkable because they are trying to hopefully be able to care for people who have been injured by this and they themselves become part of the storm. 45 bed hospital. I was talking to some of the doctors working there at the time. Tla did all of the things you expect them to do which is move patients away from glass. You have so many other considerations, oxygen, for example, radio graphic equipment. Nobody was even really injured as a result of the efforts. 
>> When you see the images of the tornado it's not just the funnel cloud itself, it is all of the debris around. There is pieces of wood here. Something like this becomes a deadly projectile. We are by a bowling alley, bowling balls all around here. If this gets picked up by the wind this would kill somebody. 
>> You hear about primary injuries the force from the tornado causes the injury. Fast winds can cause injuries to the intestines without external injuries. 
[00:39:59]



>> The wind? 
>> As a result of the force and pressure differences. And then you have the shrapnel and impalements, puncture wounds. And then the bodies are moving through the air and into something else. At the big trauma center around here, a level one trauma center those are the exact types of injuries they have seen. One thing they pointed out is they didn't see the same number of brain injuries or traumatic head injuries that they would have expected. They did see spinal cord injuries, crush injuries and other injuries. A little good news there. Exactly what you would expect as a result of this. 
>> To empty out a medical center and bring folks to another hospital 
-- 
>> in the middle of a storm. I'm always stunned. They have to take care of people. We saw this after sandy, for example, as well. At the same time that they could become patients these health care providers and nurses and doctors are trying to evacuate patients. 
>> There is also still a continuing danger you have wind and water. You have the rain. You have all of these search and rescue personnel going through the debris. That is pretty risky. You can step on nails. You can easily get injured. 
>> I was reading a study about this area in 1999 when they had a string of tornadoes, at least half of the tornado related injuries took place in the few days after the tornado. Some of them minor but still significant people were getting electrocuted. People were turning on generators getting carbon monox side poisoning. These are caveats that people know it is hard to get back to the home. 
>> Authorities have been telling people do not come to this area unless you absolutely have to, unless you have a home here or a loved one here. We will have more throughout the day. 
>>> Up next we speak with someone who survived the storm by sitting in her car at wal-mart. She became a first responder. This is cnn's special coverage live in oklahoma. ???

>>> Back live in moore, oklahoma. The storm carved a trail through the area as much as two miles wide, 17 miles long. The peak wind was 190 miles per hour. Finding survivors in the rubble seems almost impossible. More than 100 people have been pulled out of the rubble alive. Joining me now is the mayor of moore, oklahoma, glen lewis. 
>> We are still looking for survivors. We have two areas pretty much like this mostly in residential neighborhoods that we are seeing and going through with the thermal imagers and the dogs. The fema people are on scene. They have over 100 people to assist us with the dogs and cadaver dogs. 
>> Fema search and rescue teams 
-- 
>> fema is on the ground. The director of fema is already here. They have established contact with us. We have had a meeting with them. We are fixing to go into cleanup mode as soon as we get done with the rescue effort. 
>> Do you have a sense of a time table? 
>> As far as cleanup? 
>> Yeah. When you are able to go into cleanup mode? 
>> We will wait a couple of days for insurance people to take photographs. We will start immediately. If you go across the street we have rooms that are getting the debris out of the streets. We have graders making sure the roads are clear. This is the area you can get to. Over by the school the lines are still down. 
>> I didn't realize how thermal imaging equipment is at each fire station. 
>> We do. We have that through the department of homeland security. They have been really instrumental especially at night. That's how we got so many people out of the rubble. Back in the '99 tornado we didn't have that available. We may have missed some people. I think this time we have done a pretty good job of searching. We have had so many people help. When there is children involved you get volunteers from all over. We have multiple municipalities helping us. We are getting calls at city hall about one a minute. 
[00:47:51]



>> What is the situation at the school? 
>> All of the kids are accounted for. They told me. As far as I know that is what i was told a while ago about 20 minutes ago. So they are still going through looking for anybody that might have been left from a housing addition. We know that or think two of the people that were killed actually the lady who was picking up her child at the school, taking him out of school and got caught in the tornado. It was out in a field across from the school. Other than that I think everybody has been accounted for now. There was a report that there were quite a few unaccounted for because the rolls at the school were lost when the tornado hit. 
>> I talked to the state medical examiner last night and they had double what the death toll is now. They may have miscounted. 
>> I don't know. I can't explain that. 
>> It is good news. 
>> I am glad that it is down in half. 24 from 51. Five of those were in oklahoma city and the rest here in moore. 
>> When you look around this is the bowling alley. You survived in '99. How does it compare? 
>> This is a little bit more devastation. The tornado in '99 was actually stronger. It was 317 miles per hour winds. We had the highest recorded wind speeds on earth here in moore, oklahoma. This was right at 200 miles per hour. You can see the devastation. This hit diagonally across the city. It is a lot more cleanup. 
>> Do you think things need to be built differently? Is there a lesson? 
>> The last time we did it we made them attach hurricane clips to the structures as we built them. That is about as strong as you can get. Those with hold 100 miles per hour winds. A lot of people have purchased safe rooms after the '99 tornado. This time we will probably require them in new houses. That is something that we have talked about but we have never done because it is big brother thing. I would like to say thanks to the president and the governor they sent tons of help.

>> I wish you the best. 
>> Thank you very much. Appreciate you coming out. It is cold and rainy. Thanks for coming.

>>> Search and rescue efforts continue here in moore, oklahoma. John king is here. 
>> Reporter: We want to show you live pictures, the moore fire department have come in to help them. They are here moments ago. You see a cadaver dog coming into the picture. Moments ago a haz-mat team came through to make sure there were no open gas lines and no severe structural damage so if the guys came through a building would fall on them. You heard the fire chief promised to do a second and third swing through all of the homes. You see the homes are devastated. They were marked off last night or early this morning with the first wave through. They are picking through the debris. There are three or four dogs with this team in this neighborhood. I have two of them in my line of sight now. This is the meticulous difficult painful work. We have been out here for a while. It was a cold driving rain not that long ago. That rain has stopped which has made this work I would say more bearable. It is painful and difficult and most of the fine gentleman are exhausted. The neighborhood is devastated and the dog just stepped on a nail. This is what you see happening. God bless the first responders and these brave animals. That one you see in the shot just stepped on a nail and his care taker is trying to make sure he is okay. This is the day after. They are hoping against the odds probably to find someone, to find someone and at least if they can't find anyone alive to help narrow down the list of those unaccounted for. 
>> And some dogs are cadaver dogs and others are trained to find people who are still living. Could be a mix. We don't know at this point because we are seeing different groups all throughout. There are a lot of different search and rescue teams here, some trying to find the living, some trying to recover anybody who may still be underneath the rubble and to at least bring them back home to their families. Has that area been searched before? I know the officials here are saying they want to search at least three times every piece of debris. 
[00:55:39]



>> Reporter: Every house in this neighborhood was marked last night. You can see if anyone watched the coverage of tornadoes notices the red markings. You make a key point about the ! Dogs. Some of them have search dogs and some have cadaver dogs. You can see straight ahead here chris turnere our photo journalist is working hard today. They are picking threw are the rubble. Where there is a storm basement they look in. Where there isn't one you try to get a head in there to listen to see if you hear anything. Sometimes you hear them shouting things to see if anybody shouts back. We have been in the neighborhood. All of the homes were checked once but in a very preliminary way and they didn't have as many people in the immediate minutes and hours after the storm. So they are coming through now that people have come in from all over the country to help them out. They are coming through to make a second wave and a third wave as they go through it. It is difficult work. They are exhausted and it is hazardous because of all of the debris. There is broken glass, nails, buildings as you can see are mangled and destroyed and worse. The teams are doing pretty thorough job going through now. They just came into the neighborhood a short time ago and have pick axes, the animals and the work will take hours if not days. 
>> It's gotten a little easier in the last 30 minutes now that the rain has stopped. The thunder and lightning has stopped. It was miserable for about a two hour period. Let's hope the weather holds so it helps the first responders in their work. I appreciate the report. Jake tapper talked to a family whose 11-year-old daughter was evacuated. Next.

>> Yes. 
>> And in your vehicle when the storm basically hit. 
>> Yes. I didn't really have much of a choice. I couldn't get out. The wind was too strong. It seemed better just to stay where I was rather than brave the wind and chance getting blown away. 
>> What kind of vehicle do you have? 
>> An accord. 
>> Not like a big vehicle. No. It could have gotten blown away if the wind was stronger. 
>> You were just hoping that the storm wouldn't hit. 
>> Hoping and praying. There was a second funnel cloud sort of toward me. Clouds were coalescing into this mass and they got sucked into the larger tornado which is what scared me, which I was hoping would just go the other way. You know, just hoping

>> The amazing thing, though, is allot of people would have just gone home. You were on your way home. You saw a guy in the road handing out gloves. You pulled over and asked if there was anything you could do to help. 
>> It seemed like the right thing to do and I would like to believe that anyone in that situation would have done the same. 
>> You think from then on you were going around the neighborhood trying to do whatever you could. 
>> Yeah. There was a residential area behind the highway and a lot of homes were leveled and there had to be people trapped.

>> People in distress, it was difficult to realize that there were some people you couldn't help, you know. You had to wait for professionals. You just had to tell them it's okay. You know, there will be help on the way. And then there were others that you could get to easily and it was just you had this feeling of guilt for leaving the people. That you couldn't get to.

>> Over at the school, if you stop and think about it, we had a small area of building that was completely devastated. We can't put people on top of the debris because we know little people are under the debris. So we are trying to meticulously pick up stuff. 
>> It was pandemonium with children crying everywhere and teachers and so forth. But very quickly things started coming together. Everyone worked together to get the kids reunited with parents. At least for the kids at that school things worked out for the most part real well.

>> It is like a battle zone. There is nothing standing. No trees or houses. Landmarks, you don't know where you are. 
>> We are getting hundreds of requests to check certain addresses and officers can't find the street or the block. There is no reference points. There is no addresses. So it's almost just kind of going area by area and searching those areas. 
>> Our prayers are with the people of oklahoma today. Our gratitude is with the teachers who gave their all to shield their children, with the neighbors and responders who helped as soon as the tornado passed. And all of those who searched for survivors through the night. 
>> The president speaking earlier today. Some of the many survivors we have heard from so far. There are so many more stories to tell. This is still very much an unfolding situation here. Our coverage continues throughout the day and the night. I will be back at 8:00 eastern

(Peter Sagal)Equal protection under the law is guaranteedby our Constitution. The laws of the nationshould apply to everyone. It's such an important part of how we understand ourselvesas Americans. (Peter)But in our quest for equality have we gone too faror not far enough? We should have the same right todrink out of a water fountain or to marry each otheras anyone else does.

(Rachel Maddow)The Constitution...(Pat Buchanan) You haven'tread the Constitution... This little document-- it means everything to us. It's like the Big Bang. It's the most momentous thing to happen in the modern world. 

[00:02:01]


(Peter)The Constitution has been aroundr more than 225 years. But many of us don't haveany idea what it says. Of course,that's never stopped us from arguingabout what it means. I'm Peter Sagal, and I am takinga journey across the country to find out how the Constitutionworks in the 21st century. We should have the same right todrink out of a water fountain, to drive a car, and to marryeach other as anybody else has. (Peter)In this episode...we are all created equal. That's one of our nation'sfounding principles and one of our highest ideals. But it's notin the Constitution, at least notas it was drafted in 1787. It took another 80 years,a bloody civil war, and a constitutional amendment before equality becamea written guarantee. The 14th Amendment, it's so important, it's such an important part of how we understand ourselves as Americans. (Peter)For more than a century,the 14th Amendment has also been at the centerof every fight for fairness. We are here,and we ain't gonna let nobody turn us around. It's at the heart of almostevery hot-button issue of our time, Includinga few that may surprise you. (Peter)So you think you're sort ofstrangely civil rights pioneers. Strangely, yes. (Peter)But not everyone feels likethey're being treated fairly. The city made a race-based, conscious decision to discriminate against our civil rights I served my sentence,I came back to the community,they still wouldn't let me vote. (Peter)In our struggle for equality, have we gone too far...or not far enough? Let's do it! [motorcycle motor purrs] [guitar, drums, bass, & pianoplay in bright rhythm]

 ??????
Hello. Citizenship class isupstairs? (woman) 2nd floor. Thank you so much! (male teacher) So when wasthe Constitution written? (class) 1787. (teacher)1787, okay, and what doesthe Constitution do? (class) Sets up the... (teacher) Sets up the government. (Peter) Like me, these people are learningabout the Constitution. But they're doing it in orderto get something I already have. They want to become citizensof the United States. (teacher) What is an amendment?(cla) A change in the... (teacher)Yeah, a changeto the Constitution. And how many amendments, howmany changes have there been? (class) 27.(teacher) 27, okay. (Peter)Before they can qualifyfor citizenship, these students willhave to pass a test. But they do get the chanceto practice first. What do we callthe first ten amendments? What is the supreme lawof the land? What's one or right or freedomfrom the First Amendment? Speech.Yup, speech, good. Can I interrupt for a second? Let me just say, I'm supposed to know this stuff, and I would be so terrified sitting across from you I don't think I'd know anything. I always tell the students that I could go outon the street right now and ask anybody these questionsand 9 times out of 10 they wouldn't be ableto answer them. And they're American citizens. Okay, I'm game. Let's see how I do. I did highlighta few here. What year was the Constitutionwritten? Ah, 1787. What's one power of the federalgovernment? Ah, making war. Declaring war. How many voting members are inthe House of Representatives? Ah, I was gonna say 500, but that's in the Senate, I just want to say again that just you going into this mode, my anxiety level just skyrocketed. It's crazy how that happened. (Peter)I'm feeling the pressure,and I have nothing at stake. They have a lot moreriding on this. But the prize is worth it. They tookall kinds of different paths 

[00:06:03]


from all over the worldto get here to this room in Chicago,but in the end they are allafter the same thing. (male teacher)The first three wordsof the Constitution? (class) "We the people"... (teacher)"We the people," right. (Peter)Three little words-- for these aspiring citizens,becoming an American is really aboutbecoming part of the "We." They want to be able to lookat that phrase and know that they're included. But when the Constitutionwas written in 1787, a lot of people-- women,African Americans, and Native Americansweren't lly included. And joining "We the People"has been a little more complicatedthan just getting a passport. In fact, the story of Americais really the story of a struggle for inclusion a strugglefor equality, for fairness. And we can pinpoint the exactspot in our Constitution where that struggle shiftedinto high gear. It's the 14TH Amendment. Akhil Amar, who has studiedthe Constitution his whole life, doesn't think the 14th Amendmentsimply changed the document. He thinks it remade our country. Our modern Constitutionis the product not just of the founding andnot just of the Bill of Rights, but of the 14th Amendment. It's the most importantprovision in the constitution. How did it change the country? How did it change how we the people saw our rights? It takes the deep ideaof Declaration of Independence that all men are created equal and now puts itin the constitution. And now it's at the heartof the Constitution, at the foundationof the whole enterprise. (Peter)So the 14th Amendmentis a very big deal. In fact, it's been citedin more court cases than any other amendment. But to understandwhat it's all about you have to go back toa crucial moment in our history. In 1865,the country was emerging from the ashes of the Civil War. 

[00:08:03]


And it was time to deal witha Constitutional problem that had been left unsettled bythe founding fathers-- slavery. (Akhil)Slavery isthis basic contradiction at the heartof the Constitution. Most people have all theserights and liberties and yet, slaves have none. Slavery is this cancerin the Constitution and it grows and it growsand it grows. And eventually,the system breaks because of this contradiction--it fails-- the Civil War. The canceralmost kills the patient, and when we finally cut it out,we can begin to heal. (Peter)To help the patient recover,a new set of "founding fathers" came forwardat the end of the war. Many of our original Founderswere slaveholders, Washington and Madison included, but the so-calledRadical Republicans of the 1860s were staunch opponentsof slavery, Congressional firebrands likeCharles Sumner, John Bingham, and Thaddeus Stevens--they actually called him "Thad the Rad." They were ready to remakethe nation to punish the Southfor its rebellion, and remove the stain of slavery. They would do itby amending the Constitution. The 13th Amendment wasspearheaded by Lincoln himself in the last months of the war and near the end of his life. It abolished slaveryonce and for all. With its ratification, four million slaves weresuddenly free. But that wouldn't be enough. No sooner had the war ended, than the old regime in the Southretained power, and passed laws to restrict the rightsof their former slaves. The Republicans would have totake extraordinary measures to insure those rightsto make certain that African Americans would berespected as citizens. But the Supreme Court, in its infamous Dred Scottdecision of 1857, had declared that black peoplecouldn't be U.S. citizens. Chief Justice Roger Taney wrotethat they were considered 

[00:10:03]


"...so far inferior thatthey had no rights which the white manwas bound to respect." That decision had to be undone. (Akhil Amar)The first sentenceof the 14th Amendment, it makes everyone bornin the United States a citizen on the day of his or her birth. Was that intended specifically,for African Americans, for former slaves, to make themcitizens, ka-boom or was it, there wasa larger purposen that? It was both about making sure that African Americans were citizens on the day of their birth, but it's written in broader language. Ultimately, it's about us all-- black or white, male or female, Jew or gentile; whether your parents are citizens on the day that you're born, or whether they're not. Everyone born in America is born a citizen. That means that they're born an equal citizen. (Peter)The key word there is "equal." The 14th Amendmentguaranteed everyone "equal protection of the laws." That was unprecedented. But even today,a century-and-a-half later, not everyone feels equal. [motor purrs] Kristin Perry and Sandy Stier make their home in BerkeleyCalifornia, with their sons. Kris and Sandy have beena couple since 2000, and for the past decade they've been ridinga matrimonial roller coaster. So you two got together when? We met in 1998, no we metearlier than that. Right, we met in 1997.We met in997. You're smiling, you're not gritting your teeth, you're smiling. No, I am smiling!It was a fun meeting! It was a fun meeting. (Peter)In 2004, when the mayor ofSan Francisco announced that he would give out marriage certificatesto same-sex couples, Kris and Sandy practicallysprinted down to City Hall. They were among the firstto get married. But when they got backfrom their honeymoon, 

[00:12:04]


they found that the city'saction had been overturned, and their marriage wasnull and void. Did you have to give backthe gifts? No. We didn't do that,but it had an effect on us in a more lasting waythan we knew at the time. It was upsetting for all of us, and just sort of oddlyhumiliating. You know, here we had this greatcelebration with all our family and friends-- and thento have it taken away? (Peter)Then, in 2008, California votersapproved Proposition 8, a ballot initiative amendingthe state constitution, to declare that marriagewould only be legal between a man and a woman. But "Prop 8," as it was called,soon faced a legal challenge. Kris and Sandy filed suit, and the case would end upin the U.S. Supreme Court. Becoming plaintiffs in a federalcase, is a pretty big deal. That must have been a difficultdecision to go ahead with. It's been incredibly differentto take on a public role versus just privately suffer. That's what it's been like formany many years, since 2004 we've just sort ofivately suffered, feeling like we'll never getto be like other people. What about the idea that these guys are like, hey, this is my state, we had an election, I voted my conscience, my side won. And then you're gonna take away the results? I mean, isn't that undemocratic-- what about their rights as voters, as citizens of California? We don't believe they had theright to take away our rights. We didn't thinkthe voters should haveeven voted on the issue. You can vote in anything youwant if enough of you want to. That doesn't make you right, it just meansthere were more of you. So if you're a minority,and you're never going to be the majority,you will never win your rights. This is, that's whythere's a Constitution. I imagine you guys have had occasion to read the Constitution. Have you read the preamble-- "We the People?" What do you think of when you read that? Oddly enough, because I've beengay my entire adult life, I have had a hard timefeeling like it includes me. (Peter) Really?Yeah. So you're like "we the people."and you're like, not me. "We the people,"and then in parentheses, 

[00:14:06]


I wish I were part of this. I aspire to be "we the people,"part of th"We," and for me this fight for marriage equalityis like entry into "We." And without I don't believeI belong, I mean, I don't. The Constitution, and we've been reading it, doesn't say anything about marriage-- gay, straight, or otherwise. So how can you say thatthere's a constitutional right to do something you want to do,just 'cause you want to do it? Equal protection... it's about equal protection. Because whether it's marriage or something else, we should have the same right to drink out of a water fountain, to drive a car, and to marry each other that anybody else does. So that's what we're really, really fighting for. That's what our case is based on. (Peter)Of course, Equal protection is guaranteedby the 14th Amendment. And in fact, there wasa landmark case that linked marriageand the 14th Amendment. That was back in 1967. And the case was appropriatelynamed Loving versus Virginia. It involved a couple namedMildred and Richard Loving. At the time,the state of Virginia had an anti-miscegenation law,banning interracial marriage. The Lovings were found to bein violation of the law, and they were orderedto leave the state or face a year in prison. I think that marryingwho you want to is a right no man should haveanything to do with. It's a God-given right I think. (Peter)The Lovings suedthe state of Virginia, and the Supreme Courtruled in their favor. The Supreme Court says that marriage is one of the basic civil rights of man. Under the Constitution, the Court held today, unanimously, the freedom to marry or not marry a person of another race resides with the individual and cannot be infringed by racial discriminations. (Peter)The Court based its decision on the equal protection clauseof the 14th Amendment. So if the Supreme Court hasruled that the 

[00:16:07]


Constitution protects the right to marrysomeone of any race, it should also guarantee the right to marry someoneof any gender. Right? Legal scholarRobert George says no. We're meeting atthe Princeton University chapel a popular site for weddings,both gay and straight. You had a fundamental problem with anti-miscegenation laws and that's they were just rooted in a system of racial subordination and oppression. The whole purpose of 14th Amendment, the whole purpose, was to undo that kind of racial discrimination, and that's why the Court was entirely right in my view in using its 14th Amendemnt powers to overturn state anti-miscegenation laws. Well, you know that advocatesfor same-sex marriage, marriage equality, are sayingit's an analogous case. The reason that doesn't work isthat they're helping themselves to the very conclusion that they need to prove. It's true that sometimes you have laws that are clearly rooted in bigotry, and we should be able to say that that's true when that's true. But people who have conservative ideas about sex and marriage are not bigots. No one cooked up the conjugal conception of marriage, which emerges from a deephistory, and in many traditions, on the basis of bigotry. That's that's just false to the historical facts. And now, they can have a view, that's, that's fine. They can compete for their view,and if they can win a majority of their fellow citizens in a fair debate, then their views should prevail. But people on the other sidehave exactly the same right. And if they can persuade a majority of their fellow citizens, then they should prevail. What we shouldn't be able to do, Peter, either side, is to go into court to short- circuit the democratic process. 

[00:18:07]


(Peter)Whether or not you agreewith Robert George, he's right about one thing-- the 14th Amendment is not ablanket guarantee of equality. History has shown that ourgovernment draws distinctions between different groupsof people all the time and treats them unequally. You have to be a certain minimumage to get a driver's license-- that discriminatesagainst the young. And you have to havecertain abilities-- blind peoplearen't alive to drive. Or how about taxes-- your taxbracket and the rate you pay vary dependingon your income level. That's a kindof discrimination, too. And even when the Courtsconsider Equal Protection cases, they don't always come down onthe side of "more equality." Take poverty--the Supreme Court has ruled that because poverty is not what it calls"an immutable trait" a permanent characteristiclike race, the Equal Protection clausedoesn't provide much protection. And what about voting? You might think that'sa fundamental right for all Americans, protectedby the 14th Amendment. But the 14th leftvoting rights up to the states. For freed slaves it took anotheramendment the 15th to declare that no one could be prohibitedfrom voting because of race. And of course,that didn't cover women. They would have to fightfor their own amendment, the 19th, to give them the vote. Native Americanswere made citizens by an act of Congress in 1924, but they still had to winvoting rights from the states. And in 1971 at the heightof the Vietnam War there was yet anotherconstitutional amendment to extend suffrageto everyone over 18. So providing equal protectionhasn't been a simple process and it hasn't been quick,even for the group that was most in need ofprotection after the Civil War. The 14thand 15th Amendments merged the Declaration of Independenceinto the Constitution. Thomas Jefferson'sbeautiful poetry about all men 

[00:20:09]


being created equalfinally had the force of law. But just becauseequality w now written into the Constitutiondidn't make it real. There were still a lot of peoplein this country who were less equal than others. (Peter)African Americanshad been freed from slavery and given rights, but thoseexisted mainly on paper. For another century afterthe Civil War, state laws, especially in the South, keptmillions of African Americans out of the voting boothwith property and poll taxes, and mandated segregationin public places. Black citizens remained .second-class citizens. For anyone who daredto defy the rules, the penalties could be brutal. It would take a long struggle toovercome deeply-rooted racism, and rouse the conscienceof the nation. When the architects of5??our republic wrote the magnificent wordsof the Constitution and the Declarationof Independence, they were signinga promissory note to which every American wasto fall heir. We've come to cash this check-- a check that will give usupon demand the riches of freedom andthe security of justice. [loud cheering] (Peter)Finally, the Civil Rights Actof 1964 reinforced the 14th Amendment'sguarantees of equality, outlawing racial discriminationin public accommodations. And very next year,Congress passed another bill, the Voting Rights Actto make sure that the voices of all Americans would be includedin the democratic process. You might think thatwith all that struggle, the right to votewould today be sacred, enjoyed by every Americanwithout exception. You'd be wrong. In some states convicted felons are deprivedof the right to vote, 

[00:22:10]


and getting it backcan be difficult or impossible. One of those states is Kentucky. Tayna Fogle knowsabout that firsthand. I need to let you know right nowthere is 243,000 people, plus, that have in Kentucky that has lost the right to vote. 240,000? A quarter of a million people in Kentucky, cannot vote. (Peter) The reason they can'tvote is built into, of all places,the 14th Amendment. It stipulates that states candeny the vote to anyone guilty of "...participation inrebellion or other crime." The "rebellion" partreferred to ex-Confederates. But the "other crime" part can apply to anybody convictedof a felony. And today that keeps morethan five million Americans from casting their votes. The laws varyfrom state to state. Maine and Vermont allow felonsto vote even from prison. But in a dozen statesthey can be barred for life. In Kentucky,only an executive pardon can give them back the vote. Tell me Tayna, why this issueis so important to you, this issue of felonsgetting the right to vote. Well um, the main issue, and the reason why it's so important to me because I'm an ex formerly incarcerated person. And so I know how hard it is in order for someone to get their voting rights back because I went through that process. (Peter)Tayna played as a star forward on the Universityof Kentucky basketball team. But a few years after collegeshe was in prison for drug traffickingand writing bad checks. As a convicted felonshe lost the right to vote, and she worked hardfor 13 years to get it back. What do you say to peoplewho say that's the law-- if you don't if you want tovote, don't commit a felony. Don't be a criminal, why shouldwe let these criminals, you criminals, you know,exercise their franchise . How can we trust you? Well, here's the deal. Once we're released and we've served our time in this community, then that shouldn't be a lifelong sentence. 

[00:24:12]


I served a 10-year prison sentence. I'm not saying that I shouldn't have been charged. I'm not making any excuses. I'm saying I did exactly what the judge told me to do. I served my sentence, I came back in the community, started contributing, stoppedtaking from the community, became a model citizen, and theystill wouldn't let me vote. A lot of my people died for the struggle, to give me the right to vote. [with emotion] When my mom first took me down to sign up, she told me how important it was to have a voice. And she said if you don't do anything else, make sure you go to the poll. And I remember going to the poll the first time with her, and so ah... ever since she took me to the poll, even though I've had things happen in my life, it was something about pulling that lever, it was an empowerment. I've held th dear to my heart,even though I made bad choices that landed me where I was landed, but that's in the past, God has seen something in my future, and he has given me ability to speak out and not be afraid. (Peter)The 14th Amendment was intendedto expand and protect rights. It's ironic thatit deprives some people of their rightsand their voices. Michelle Alexander argues thatit ends up coming down hardest on the very group it wasoriginally meant to help. The problem is,is that we live in the era of mass incarceration. You know, in the past fewdecades, we've quintupled our prisonpopulation, and in cities like Chico, more than half of working ageAfrican American men now have criminal records. In the United States today if you have been labeleda criminal or a felon 

[00:26:13]


you are deemed ineligible for many ofthe basic civil and human rights that were supposedly wonin the civil rights movement and that so many of ustake for granted. If you have to check the boxfor the rest of your life on employmentapplications asking have you ever been convictedof a felony, you're unable to get housingeven aess to public housing, you're not ableto even to get food stamps, and if you say it's okayto deny all of those folks their basic civil and humanrights, what you're doing is creatinga new second-class status. If we're going to be of,by, and for the people, it should includeeach and every one of us. So what's the failure here? Has the Constitution failed or have we failed it in this regard? The words of the Constitutionitself um, are a promise that has yet to be fully fulfilled. It's not up to the lawyersand the judges alone, to make those words meaningful,it's up to all of us. If we want the 14th Amendment to guaranteeequal treatment for all, it's going to takea movement of ordinary people defining what equal treatmentreally is. (Tayna)Raised my grandchildren, we sentthem off to school every day. This is my sister Margaret . Pleasure to meet you. Nice meeting you. (Peter)These days,Tayna Fogle is working to change Kentucky's state laws, to make it easier for ex-felonsto regain their rights. We're building a placefor everybody who has served out their timeand who has a right to vote to become fullholistic citizens. (Peter)Michelle Alexanderand Tayna Fogle will tell you that the struggle to achieveequality is far from over. But there are others who saythat our efforts can go too far. Affirmative action programsbegan in the 1960s, in the wakeof the Civil Rights movement. They're intended to giveminorities a leg up, and to increase diversityin hiring and education. 

[00:28:16]


But giving preferentialtreatment to one group may take awayopportunities from another. Here in Connecticuta few years ago, a group of firefighters fileda discrimination suit. They said they were being judgedon their race, and not on their skills. I said, skills? What skills?You go to the burning house, you spray water on the glowyparts, what skills do you need? So these guys showed me. You gotta be prepared for everything, and that's what firefighter safety and survival is about. Let's do it. ep breath. (Frank) You're up Peter. Straight through the wall thisway to make sure nothing's on the other side of the wall--as hard as you can. There you go. You're hired. All right man.Where's the fire? [Frank laughs] (Peter)Frank Ricci is a 15-year veteran of the New HavenFire Department. Not long ago he wasmade a Lieutenant. Throughout your whole career you prepare for promotion. It's like studying for the Bar Exam. I studied up to 13 hours a day. While workingas a firefighter? While working as a firefighter.How do you manage that? You don't carve pumpkins with your kids, you don't do the birthdays, you simply study. (Peter)But in this case, all thatstudying seemed to go to waste. After Frank Riccitook his exam, the city of New Haventhrew it out, along with the testsof all the other candidates. The city decided that not enoughAfrican American firefighters had qualified for promotion, and feared it couldface a discrimination lawsuit. So to avoid that risk,it declared that the test was flawed,and invalidated all the results. And then the city was sued--by Frank Ricci 

[00:30:17]


and 19 of his colleagues,all of them white or Hispanic. They contended that they werethe victims of discrimination. 20. They say they weredenied promotions the city will now be decidedby the U.S. Supreme Court. We undertake this actionfor firefighters across the countryand for public safety. The city made a race-based,conscious decision to discriminate againstour civil rights. Tell me whatthe Constitutional argument is. Equal protection-- it's very simple-- equal protection under the law--the laws of the nation should apply to everyone regardless of race. So did you feel at that time,well, discriminated against? Well, I think that America fails whenever we take peopleand put them in racial groups. The government, because ofthe equal protection law, and because of our Constitution,has no role in dividing people upin racial categories. (Peter)It would be up tothe Supreme Court to decide whether New Haven's actionwas justified, or whether it was guiltyof reverse discrimination. Did you come to understandin any way, I mean, not necessarily agreeing, but maybejust seeing the point of view, why they city did what they didin that regard? No, because it when someonecalls 911 they don't care if the person who respondsis white, black, or Hispanic. They only care that the persongets there quickly, is competent and respectful,and can do the job. (Peter)In the end the Supreme Courtfound against the City. It said the Civil Rights Act'sprohibition against racial discriminationapplied to all races. And the Fire Department had toaccept the results of the exam. Which meant that Frank Riccifinally got his promotion. 
  ??????
Maybe we still haven'tfigured out how to make good on the heady promisesof the 14th Amendment. After all, it was designed to fight discriminationagainst freed slaves. Now, ironically,Michelle Alexander says it discriminates againsttheir descendants. And Frank Ricci complains thatour efforts to fight injustice 

[00:32:18]


lead us to discriminateagainst whites! So in spiteof the 14th Amendment, or perhaps because of it,there still seems to be a lot of disagreement aboutwho is protected and who isn't. [marching band plays] 
 [people cheer]       ??????
Friday night, Tyler, Texas, the Homecoming game--What could be more American? (Peter)Everybody who's anybody in Tyler is here tonightto see the big game, with their favorite team, theJohn Tyler High School Lions. They take their footballseriously here in Tyler. And nobody's more seriousthan the Lopez family. So who here attended this high school? That one and this oneand those two down there. You went to JT, didn't you? We grew upon the other side of town, by downtown, about 7, 8 miles. My parents still live there. When JT and Lee would play,when our kids were younger, we'd make the game, and it was a big time rivalryeven around the house. They'd go downwith their rebel flags, Yeah, it was ah, it was ah,it was something to see. (man)Touchdown, John Tyer! [cheering] (Peter)The Lopez family,quintessentially Texan, which meansquintessentially American. But that wasn'tthe case 35 years ago. In Texas today testimony beginsin a federal court in a case challenginga state law that prohibits funding of education forthe children of illegal aliens. (man)Every night hundreds of Mexicansenter Texas illegally. Texas schools containat least 10,000 children of illegal aliens, and officialsfear more will come. Their presence is becoming a major sourceof dilution of resources. 

[00:34:21]


(Peter)Back in the 1970s, the Lopez familywas among those illegal aliens. Jose came first,crossing over from Mexico. He found work in Tyler,and a few years later his wife Lydia joined himwith their four children. But when they enrolled Alfredo,Faviola, and Noe in the local public school,they ran into a big problem. Tes had just passed a lawrequiring that parents prove their kids were here legally,or pay $1,000 per student for the privilegeof attending public school. Jose and Lydia Lopez couldn'tafford to pay. So they risked exposure anddeportation by going public, to join a class-action suit against the local school board. (man)Alfredo, how would you feelif you couldn't go to school? I would feel terrible because I would need an educationto get a job somewhere. Eventually the case madeits way up to the Supreme Court, where it would become a test,not only of immigration policy, but the meaningof the 14th Amendment. It will make a mockery ofthe law if the Court suggests that the 14th Amendmentextends benefits to people illegallyin the country. (Peter)The Justices that theTexas law was unconstitutional. The reason? Accordingto the 14th Amendment: equal protection isn't just forcitizens, but for "any person." So state governmentscan't pass laws that apply onlyto one class of people. That means that even thoughillegal immigrants aren't citizens, they'reprotected by our laws, as persons, on an equal basis. Texas had to provide a publiceducation for the Lopez kids, just as it did for the kidsof American citizens. If we lost the case, we wouldhave had a bunch of illiterate kidsrunning around here. But I still say "wow!" (Peter)Everybody wants kidsto get a good education. But if the 14th Amendment evenmade illegal immigrants part of "We the People,"where do we draw the line? 

[00:36:25]


[motor purrs] This amendment was a huge leapforward for America, but It's been a real struggle to apply its simple idealsto our very complicated world. The 14th Amendment doesmore than tell us who is includedin "We the People." It lays out the privilegesof membership: defining what rights will be protectedand who will do the protecting. Most of the amendments writtenbefore the Civil War were designed to place limitson the federal government. (Akhil Amar)Note how the Bill of Rightsbegins-- First Amendment: "Congressshall make no law..." Buthe ReconstructionAmendments have this very different feel. 13th amendment, last sentence--"congress shall have power." 14th amendment, 15th amendment,last sentence-- "Congress shall have power." Power to do what?--Power to end slavery; to provide for equality; to provide for fundamentalhuman rights against states. The original Bill of Rightsprotects Americans only against Congress, onlyagainst the federal government. Because they had justfought a revolution against a central government. They were worried about abusesby the central governmen But after the Civil War,it becomes clear that states can misbehave too,that we need a Bill of Rights, a second Bill of Rights,in effect, against states. Who's gonna enforcethat second Bill of Rights? The national government. The 14th Amendment issweeping power to enforce a visionof liberty and justice for all. So in effect, what it'ssaying is, no state can mess withfundamental freedoms. Now the question is what's a fundamental freedom,and who decides that? It doesn't say you have a rightto have a pet dog or to play the fiddleor to wear a hat or to enjoy conjugal happinesswith your spouse, but of course you have thoserights, this is America! (Peter)Yeah! This is America! I can enjoy conjugal happiness while wearing a hatand playing a fiddle. And my pet dog can dance a jigat the foot of the bed. 

[00:38:26]


Maybe we'll leavethe dog out of it. But still, as long as I dowhat I want in the privacy of my bedroom it's nobody'sbusiness but mine. Right? Well, it sounds right;we assume it's Constitutional. But how do you find outfor sure? Well, You talkto an expert on the subject while shopping for bedroomfurniture in lower Manhattan. We wanted to talk to you herebecause what do they have here but beds and bedrooms,and this is, we understand, your specialtyas a law professor. Well, when you teach Constitutional law, you spend a lot of time talking about bedrooms. You do really?Does that like come up amendments and the bedroom clausesand stuff like that? Well, so much of the Constitutional law that's important today that we argue about, that we think about, has to do with right to privacy. The really early cases dealing with the right to privacy had to do with the marital bedroom in particular. (Peter)This is really such a powerfulsymbol of privacy, I guess. Everybody thinks like, this ismy business, in my bedroom, you know, everybody thinkseverybody is basically an adolescent boy,it's my bedroom-- stay out! Is there some sortof invisible force field that keeps the federalgovernment from getting involved in whatever we chooseto do in our beds? There's no constitutional right to do whatever you want so long as it's in your bedroom. There's a Constitutional right to do certain kinds of things, and when it starts out in the early 1960s, we're talking about married people using contraceptives. That's associated with the bedroom. (Peter)Jamal Greene is referring toa 1965 case about birth control. The Supreme Court struck down a Connecticut state lawthat prohibited contraception. In a groundbreaking decision,Justice William O. Douglas said that the law violatedhe right to marital privacy." He argued it was a fundamentalfreedom built into our culture even if it's not explicitlyspelled out in the Constitution. Giving married couplesthe right to contraception seems uncontroversialtoday, just like the general proposition that the Government can't snoop intowhat you do in your bedroom. But in a lot of privacy cases 

[00:40:27]


dealing with more divisiveissues like homosexuality or abortion the Court venturedinto the heart of the storm. In a landmark ruling, the Supreme Court todaylegalized abortions. (Peter)No privacy case has been morecontentious than Roe v. Wade. That 1973 decisionstruck down a Texas law that prohibited abortions exceptto save the life of the mother. Again the Justices wentstraight to the 14th Amendment when they said that a womanhas a right to privacy and a right to chooseto terminate her pregnancy. That decisiontouched off a battle that is stillbeing fought today. It's not a fetus, it'sa human life! It's not a dog. It's not your choice! (Peter)The two sides on these issues seem to havestarkly opposing views of where the zone of privacybegins and ends. The words libertyand equality are obviously in the 14th amendment, butthe words abortion are not, the words homosexuality are not,the word sodomy, or contraception,or any of these things we're talking aboutare not in the Constitution. So how do you decide? If we'retalking about the liberty to do something, especially ifit's a liberty to do something that the founders probablydidn't envision. This is, the $64,000 question-- how do you decide? You have one set of people who say look to the-- what did the framers intend, when they put this language in the Constitution, other people say well, the framers lived in a very different world, very different set of values, a very different technology, totally different world, so we have to look to what our own understanding is today of what liberty really means. And so that's always going to be the battle on the Court, that's the battle over abortion rights, that's the battle over same-sex intimacy, that's the fight that people are having. (Peter)Given how sensitivesome of these issues are, it's no wonder that they'reso difficult to resolve. Curt Lash believes thatwhen the courts get involved, it only makes matters worse. Some scholars interpretthe 14th amendment as a period of time whenwe actually gave power 

[00:42:27]


into the hands of the courts,to define liberty, however the court thinksliberty ought to be defined. And from its framers'perspective, that isn't what they were trying to dowith the 14th amendment. They wanted to carefullydelineate certain rights and libertieswithout opening the door to judicialor legislative tyranny. It's the supreme courtthat then goes beyond that and begins to come up withexpansive ideas of liberty that havenothing to do with rights actually enshrinedin the constitution. The question is,how can that be a problem? How can expansive visionsof liberty be a problem? Well, they're a problemwhen they interfere with the people's decisions about what kind of policiesthey want to enact, and when they wantto enact a policy that they have never intendedto constitutionalize. When you constitutionalizesomething you actually take it outof political debate. You constitutionalize, you make it sort of part of the constitution as readinto it you can't change it. You can't change it!No matter how much political majorities might wantto go back and forth on it, you've actually endedvoting on the matter. You've endeddiscussion on the matter. (Peter)The Court just can't seem toleave the 14th Amendment alone. It's been interpreted andreinterpreted, as Kurt Lash says,to "constitutionalize" rights that aren't mentionedin the text. But unlike privacy, there'sanother right that's spelled out more clearly in theConstitution, economic liberty. And it was reinforcedin the 14th Amendment to protect the rightsof former slaves to do what they had been unableto do before: earn their own breadby the sweat of their own brow. But our notionof economic liberty has evolved over timeand sparked fierce debate. The current quarrels about it can lead you to placesyou might not expect. [dee resonant ring of a bell] About an hour north of NewOrleans is St. Joseph Abbey. It's a place of prayer and contemplation,reflection and serenity. 

[00:44:29]


[loud whirring] Well, so much for serenity! These monks have foundan unusual calling. They've added carpentryto contemplation. But they are stillpreparing for eternity. Come right in. Sure. Oh, so thisis your showroom. Howluxurious! It's not very large. casket. People usually choose this modelfor their loved ones. This isn't much of a, this isn't much of a showroom in terms of like, you know, retail "zing." No. No. You need a slogan.We do. Like, how about St. Joseph's Caskets-- Make it a Habit! [laughter] There you go. And you started making thesefor yourselves, right? We did, we have been makingcaskets for ourselves for as long asthe monastery's been here, which is over 100 years. And it's only recentlythat we began to market them. How many of these do you sell these days? We're averagingabout 20 a month. And so this, this business, to the extent that it is a business, really existsonly to support the monastery. That's correct.It's to help us to meet particularly the healthcareneeds and the, of the elderly, and the educational needsof the younger men coming in. Why would anybody have a problemwith you doing this? Well, we askedthe same question in 2007. When we initiatedSt. Joseph Woodworks, I receiveda cease and desist letter from the State Board of FuneralDirectors and Embalmers, instructing us that we were in violation of a state law,which we had no idea about. (Peter)The problem was this: If you want to sell casketsin Louisiana, you have to be a funeral director,licensed by the state. That's the law, and it givesLouisiana funeral homes a monopolyon the casket business. The monks have nothing againstfuneral directors, but they'd like to be able 

[00:46:30]


to sell their ownnice wooden boxes as well. And their supporters insist that they should havethat right, because the 14th amendment guaranteesthem economic liberty. The monks of St. Joseph aren'tthe only ones who've been fighting against government-sanctioned monopolies. So are hairdressers in Utahand cab drivers in Denver. When you started this fight, did you see it as a constitutional issue? As I got to know moreabout the issue and worked with our attorneysat the Institute for Justice, I began to realizeand to see that it was, is a constitutional issue. And we as a community of monksreally became committed that we're not only fightingfor our right to sell caskets but for the right of othersto sell caskets or to share any formof economic freedom that we feltwe were being denied. So it became more of aconstitutional issue for us all. I can only imagine, I don't know what life is like at the monastery, but I assume you don't really deal with legislative and political issues all that much in the course of your day. We don't. Ever!But um, this time it really affectedwhat we do, basically do, and that is our own craftwork. So you think you've, sort of, strangely, civil rights pioneers. Strangely,yes. Not a role you saw for yourself.Not something we ever saw. (Peter)When the monks' case made itsway to federal court, they won. The judge said that Louisiana'scasket monopoly had no rational basis--it didn'tserve any useful purpose, except for the benefitof funeral directors, and the monks had a rightto make and sell their wares. So the monks could getback to business and enjoy their economic liberty,courtesy of the 14th Amendment. As we've seen, the 14thAmendment is a big toolbox. It provides the means to doall sorts of things, like expanding equality, protectingrights enhancing liberty-- 

[00:48:30]


the basic stuffAmerica is made of. The 14th Amendment, it's such an important part of how we understand ourselves as American. And it's not supposed to be easy, we have disagreements about things, those are often good faith disagreements. The great legacy that the framers have left to us is a framework. And I don't know of any way to work out disagreements other than through a process of give and take. (Peter)So the 14th Amendmentdoesn't solve every problem. And it doesn't guarantee that everyone getswhat they're after. Kristin Perry and Sandy Stierrecognize that fact. It was going to go to you! (Kristin) It's all arm, Sandy,it's all arm. (Peter) Let's say, cause I know your case is being appealed, and it'll be in front of the Supreme Court. Let's say that they rule against you. That they find no Constitutional right to same-sex marriage-- would you accept that? Well, we would haveto live with it, and we wouldn't agree with it. But we would live with it. I think what you do is,you accept the life you've been given and the lifewe've been given is, we don't get to be married. I've done thatmy entire life already. Not every country has aconstitution, I feel like, fortunate to live ina country that does have one. Um and, I feel like I've got a great deal of faith in it. Despite all the things thatpeople do and don't agree upon. The one thing that we all havein common is the Constitution, and it's the one placewe can all go to find out how to solve problemsor how we're connected. (Peter)For Akhil Amar, that connectionwe all share is expressed most vividly in the openingwords of the 14th Amendment. (Akhil Amar)The first sentence makes everyone bornin the United States a citizen on the dayof his or her birth. We push a reset button every generation. So even if your parents weren't here legally, you're born here, you're one of us. And I think that's pretty amazing. Now, cards on the table, maybe I feel that way 

[00:50:32]


because that's what makes me a citizen. On the day that I was born, my folks aren't citizens, they're not even Grn Card holders. They weren't here illegally, butthey were here just as students. And thez were supposed to have to go back, but because of this Constitution, I'm a citizen on the day I'm born. It's this great gift that this country gave to me, and I spent the rest of my life trying to pay that gift back by giving my life to this Constitution. (Peter)The gift of birthrightcitizenship is a rare thing. Among developed nations only the United Statesand Canada offer it. But, of course, that's notthe only route to citizenship. If you want to make the effortand if you pass the test you can becomea naturalized citizen. And that is a big draw. In the past century and a half,millions of immigrants have gone through the processof naturalization including my grandparents. Today here in Chicago,a brand-new batch of prospective citizensis waiting to be sworn in. It's always been my my greatestwish to be an American. This is my place,this is where my family is, so this is where I want to be. You thinkabout the Constitution,does it mean something to you? Yeah.What doesit mean? Freedom of speech, freedom of religion. That's great.What's the first thinyou'regonna do when you're a citizen? I would like to register to vote. Toy I'm gonna be a citizen, I'm really happy about it. (Peter)They came herefrom Africa or Asia, from Latin America,the Caribbean. They all haveone thing in common-- they made a conscious decisionto become Americans. (woman)I hereby declare on oath... (all)I hereby declare on oath... (Peter)In a few seconds they'll have something elsein common. Wait for it... (woman)You are now citizensof the United States. Congratulations to you all! [cheers, applause, & whistles] Congratulations,we're glad to have you. Congratulations. Thank you so much sir. 

[00:52:32]


You're very welcome. and I really feel grateful for what I have today. That's great.What are you gonna do now? Ah, take my dream to another level. There you go! (Peter)These new citizens havetraveled a long way to become partof " and our march to equalitycontinues. Because America has alwaysbeen... a work in progress. 
  ??????
Our Constitution has endured for over 225 years. This document isn't just about what happened in 1787, but what's still happening. (Peter)But is it up to the challeesof the 21st century? So we just walkedthrough an entire congressionaldistrict in one block! Or is it time for a makeover? Your constitutional provisionsare no match for me!

Oh... Captioning sponsored by Nbc/universal Ooh, ah! Narrator: George was enjoying his absolute favorite dream. (laughing) It put him in the mood for grapes. Man: Grapes! Grapes! Get your big, green, juicy grapes right here. Ooh! (chuckling) (hooting wildly) Ooh! Ah! It's a new farmer's market, George. You ready to do some shopping? Uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh! Great. (gasps): Ooh! Ahh... (Hundley grumbles) (chatters excitedly) Hey! (barking angrily) Hundley was not enjoying all these people messing up the front of his building. Okay, George, here's the plan. George? Right. You disappear. I'll do the shopping and catch up with you later. Man: Grapes, get your big, green, juicy grapes right here. 

[00:04:05]


(chatters inquisitively) Want to sample my grapes? Oh! Sorry, Georg But try some. They're extra juicy. (exclaims) Man 2: If you like juicy, there's nothing juicier than actual juice. Try the most delicious drink you'll ever drink, courtesy of me, Juicy Jay. It's got five fruits and vegetables. Oh. Plus a special secret ingredient. (exclaims) That was the best drink George ever drank. (chatters "Two more") Here you go. George, wait'll you see all the stuff I bought. (chatters "Here, here, here!") Well, okay, but just one sip. I'm not very thirsty. Hmm. (slurping, gulping) Ahh! Whew! Can I have two more? You sure can. Oh! (whirring) That's some juicer you've got there. Second best invention in the world. The first is my tasty health drink. (chatters "Thank you") (slurping) (continues slurping) I know these are delicious, but we should save the rest for later, George. Well, okay. I think that's later enough. (George laughing and shouting) (both slurping) Mmm. Boy, that was tasty! 

[00:06:06]


Uh-huh. Are you thinking what I'm thinking? Huh. (hooting wildly) Right, let's go. (gasps) Hey. Where'd everybody go? Everybody packed up and left already. Huh? But don't worry. They'll be back next week. Huh? Huh? (moans) A whole week without juice? What was George going to do? You know, George, if we had our own juicer, we could make the drink ourselves. (gasps, chatters excitedly) There's a kitchen supply store right around the corner. Let's go! Yeah! Oh, boy. I have no idea how to use this. But when in doubt, read the... instructions? Hmm. I guess there are no instructions. Oh. Well, don't worry. Between a smart man and a smart monkey we should be able to figure it out. (phone ringing) Hello. What?! I'll be right there. Sorry, George. Professor Wiseman needs me at the museum. They're picking a new shade of yellow for the main hall. I'll be back as soon as I can. (chatters "Okay") (door closes) Ooh. George figured a smart monkey all by himself should be able to work this thing. (whirring) (hoong) Now, what did Juicy Jay say he put in that drink? It's got five fruits and vegetables, plus a special secret ingredient. Five fruits and vegetables. All of them seemed to be red. Hmm. Apples are red. 

[00:08:08]


And peppers. And strawberries. Ooh. And watermelons. Ahh! George didn't know what cabbage was, but it was the last red thing in the fridge. Five red things. Oh... Now, all George needed was a special ingredient. (exclaims) (sniffing) Hmm. A red fish? Why not? (whirring) (hooting happily) (gurgling) Okay. So maybe raw fish is not a special juice ingredient. George decided he'd try again, and make a fish-free juice. He started with one of everything: one apple, one strawberry, one pepper, one piece of watermelon and one whatever this was. (whirring) (humming) (groans) That wasn't it at all. He had the red ingredients. Hmm... What could be the problem? (blender whirring) (Hundley whines) George decided to experiment with different amounts of each ingredient. He used a big piece of paper to keep track. 

[00:10:11]


(blender whirring) Hmm? Ahh... (sniffs) (barks) Not berry enough. So George added strawberries. Ugh. Too sweet. George added more peppers. (both sputtering) It still wasn't right. And it certainly didn't pass the Hundley test. (groans) Maybe George needed more of... these things! Close, but George thought more apples might help. Yay! George's juice was perfect. Well, almost. It still needed a special secret ingredient. Huh... Where could he find one of those? Ah! Pisghetti: Hello, Giorgio. Say, can I interest you in today's special? Special? That's exactly what he was looking for. It's eggplant piccata, with extra amounts of piccata. Oh... Oh, those are radishes. Try one. Try one. Oh... Oh, but careful. Radishes are a little, eh... speziato. That means "spicy." (coughs) Radishes were spicy. But spicy might be good in a drink. Ooh. (chuckles) I know. Help yourself, Giorgio. (hooting) 

[00:12:11]


Just the radishes? Uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh. Bye-bye. Bye-bye. George hoped that one radish would do the trick. Ah! George had done it. His juice was just as good as Juicy Jay's. Better, even. George. Oh, no. Hi. Oh, have you been making juice? Uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh. Mmm! Oh, oh, my goodness, this juice is amazing. (both laughing) Yeah! George thought his juice was so delicious he decided to give it away at the next farmer's market. Get your "George Juice." It's made with apples for strong bones, cabbage for Vitamin C and a bunch of other healthy stuff. (hooting) Oh, thanks. Oh! This is fantastic! Can I get the recipe? Sure. George started with your juice, but added a few new ingredients. Uh-huh, uh-huh. A radish?! Oh, that is brilliant! A revolution in juice-making. To George and his delicious George Juice. Yahoo! Girl: George is a monkey. Girl: George is a monkey. He used different amounts of ingredients to make his own really good juice. Today, we are making juices out of different fruits and vegetables. This is a juicer, similar to what Curious George was using. Boy: I'm making spinach juice. Girl: Oh, yuck! Oh, yuck! Oh, yuck! Girl: Patrick is using a simple squeezer. The juice goes through these holes. Patrick: These juices have vitamins, 

[00:14:12]


minerals, and other healthy stuff. Girl: Each kid is coming up with their own recipe. For this recipe, I'm going to use only green and brown juices. Four scoops of lime, one scoop of spinach, four scoops of celery, two scoops of apple. It tastes sour, and it tastes really bad. (kids laughing) Fourscoops of carrot, five scoops of tomato, and two scoops of spinach. It's really good. (hiccups) Girl: It's healthy, and it's yummy. Narrator: Of all the birds George loved to visit at the aviary, the Cerulean Warbler was his favorite. (excited chatter) Which is why today was so important to him. Well Director, here's the book. Everything you ever wanted to know about the Cerulean Warbler in just 1,400 pages. (hooting) Very impressive. Uh-huh, uh-huh. I want everyone to know that the Warbler is endangered. There aren't many left. Hopefully, this will do the trick. Oh, a book like this will help get the word out. How's it selling? Uh, not so well. We were hoping you could give them to all the bird lovers who come here to the aviary. Uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh. Sure. How many? Um, just a... few... hundred? Well, it's a very important topic, so I'll see what I can do. Thanks. Man: I have another plan for spreading the bird word, George. I'm meeting today with Lance Libro. He owns a big chain of book stores. And you know what I'm going to say? Huh? "Mr. Libro, the Cerulean Warbler needs your help. 

[00:16:13]


You must carry my book." (excited chatter) Oh, boy. Narrator: Later that morning, George was still thinking about the Warbler... (imitates bird trilling) ...and the fact that their bathtub was filled with books. Steve: Lemonade. Get your free lemonade. Huh? Ah! Say, can I have another? Mmm, gosh, this is wonderful. The best ever! (exclaims) Hey, George. You know why they call me the "The Lemonade King"? Uh... uh-uh. (smacks lips) Mm-mmm. Ahh... Free samples. Once people try this stuff, they're hooked. They can't get enough, and they bring back their friends. Mmm, this is the best ever. I'll take two, please! Wow. Sure. Ah... Oh! That gave George an idea. If people got free samples of the Man's book, maybe they'd give some to their friends, too. That'd be a great way to spread the bird word. Ooh. ahh... What you got there? Ah, The Man's Warbler book? (exclaims) With each lemonade you're going to give a free book? In business, we call that a two-for-one. Can't miss. (laughing) (hoots "Thank you") But not everyone who wanted lemonade wanted a book. Either it didn't fit on a bicycle... (gasps) Ew! ...or it was too yellow... Aw. ...or they didn't know how to read. (groans) (coins rattling) Another great sales day for the King. 

[00:18:15]


How'd you do? (unhappy chatter) Hmm. Looks like you need to reach more people. You should advertise! Huh? It means show what you got, so people know you're here. Check out my sign. Hmm. Hey! (hooting) That's the idea. You just need to put the sign where a lot of people can see it. Hmm... huh... (hoots excitedly) Now you're talking. People will see that for miles. Want some help? Yeah! (chuckles) Okay, so we need to paint something that'll really grab people. A picture with pizzazz! Boring. Boring. Super boring! Mega boring. (hoots excitedly) Bingo! Now for the paint. Sheesh, that billboard is kinda high. Uh, George, how about you paint and I'll supervise from here, okay? (chatters "Okay") Don't forget the picture. (chatters "I know") (pulleys squeaking) 

[00:20:18]


When George got close to the billboard, he could see things he couldn't see from far away, like the fact that the billboard wasn't just one big sheet of paper, but six sheets glued together. Hmm. (chuckles) That's it. Start from the center! Neatness counts. I'm here for ya, buddy. Go, go, go... Score! (George chatters) Hey, George. Are you done? Uh-huh. Uh, George... Huh? Did you paint the picture on the billboard the same size as this? Uh-huh, uh-huh. Oh, that explains it. You painted too small. I'll show you. You can't see small stuff from far away! Oh! So George resolved to paint big. (exclaims) He'd cover every last inch of that billboard. (snoring) Ha! Huh?! Who?! Oh, hi, George. How'd ya do? Huh? It looks like you painted only part of the picture. Did you run out of room? Uh-huh. George wondered how he could get a small picture onto a big billboard. Then he noticed something. Hmm. Huh? Hey! The fold marks on the picture were just like the rectangles on the billboard. Aha! (chattering) 

[00:22:21]


Oh, I get it. Match the rectangles here with the rectangles there. That'll work. Here, I'll make it easier. Six rectangles. Paint one at a time, and you're good to go! Ha! This time George was sure he'd get it right. What?! George! Come down here, quick! (hooting) (chattering) Look! You're painting the rectangles out of order! (George gasps) (groans) Let's put the pictures back in order. Uh, okay, that looks good. But how do we keep them in order when you're up there? Aha! George remembered that numbers were a good way to keep track of things. You're numbering them? (hooting) Good idea! To keep everything straight, George numbered the rectangles on the billboard in the same order. Lookin' good, George! (groans) Boy, talk about a slow news day. Hey, the's a monkey painting a billboard. I wish. There's a monkey painting the billboard! Pull over! Are we rolling? This is a special report... today... live. One monkey. One billboard. One story you'll never forget. 

[00:24:21]


Mr. Libro, won't you please reconsider? My book is very important. Yeah. But is it funny? Well, no. See, that's a problem, 'cause I like funny. Hey, what's everybody staring at? Is that a monkey?! What's he doin'? Oh, no. I know that billboard. What? (Libro laughs) Look at that! A monkey painting a goofy guy with a bird on his... Wait a minute. You're the guy. Yup. It's me... and my monkey. Brilliant advertising campai! If your book is half as brilliant as that billboard, then I'm sold! I've never seen anything like it! This book is selling like hotcakes! Well, George deserves the credit for that. (laughs) It made me laugh, it made me cry, it made me wanna donate half the proceeds to the Warbler Foundation. And there you have it-- one book, one monkey, one recipe for sales success! Reporting live from Lotsa Libros. Don't forget, save the Warbler! And try Steve's lemonade! Hey! (chatters) Boy: George is a monkey. He figured out how to make the picture much bigger. Woman: I wonder how we're going to make this map of South America big enough so that it can go on this wall. Boy: People can make different parts of it. This is called a grid. When you see a pattern like this, where's there's lines down and lines across, it's a grid. We've got our grid of South America. Each of you is going to get one part of South America to make. This small square is going to become this big square. She gave us a paper, and it has a little square 

[00:26:22]


to tell you which part of the map you're doing. Everybody's going to have a partner and do a part. Boy: We're going to put it all together, and it's going to make a big South America map. (applause) What do you think? It looks like South America! Yes. (cheering) Abracadabra! Announcer: Pbs kids is planning a playdate so big, so gurrific it's gonna last a whole week long. Let's go camping! Announcer: Get ready for playdate week on "daniel tiger's neighborhood." Hiya, toots! I'm here to play!

Oh... Captioning sponsored by Nbc/universal Ooh, ah! Narrator: George was enjoying his absolute favorite dream. (laughing) It put him in the mood for grapes. 

[00:02:01]


Man: Grapes! Grapes! Get your big, green, juicy grapes right here. Ooh! (chuckling) (hooting wildly) Ooh! Ah! It's a new farmer's market, George. You ready to do some shopping? Uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh! Great. (gasps): Ooh! Ahh... (Hundley grumbles) (chatters excitedly) Hey! (barking angrily) Hundley was not enjoying all these people messing up the front of his building.

George's juice was perfect. Well, almost. It still needed a special secret ingredient. Huh... Where could he find one of those? Ah! Pisghetti: Hello, Giorgio. Say, can I interest you in today's special? Special? That's exactly what he was looking for. It's eggplant piccata, with extra amounts of piccata. Oh... Oh, those are radishes. Try one. Try one.

BOY: The juice goes through these holes and then the pulp can't go through the holes 'cause it's too big. These juices have vitamins, minerals and other healthy stuff. Girl 1: Each kid is coming up with their own recipe. Girl 2: One half of a banana, three scoops of lemon and four scoops of papaya. For the banana recipes, we have to use the blender because the banana doesn't work well in the juicer. It tastes a little bit sour and a little bit sweet. For this recipe I'm going to use only green and brown juices. Yummy! Four scoops of lime, one scoop of spinach, four scoops of celery and two scoops of apple juice. It tastes sour, and it tastes really bad. Girl: That's four scoops of carrot, five scoops of tomato and two scoops of spinach. 

[00:14:07]


It's really good. (hiccups) It's healthy and it's yummy. Narrator: Of all the birds George loved to visit at the aviary, the Cerulean Warbler was his favorite.

Ah! Say, can I have another? Mmm, gosh, this is wonderful. The best ever! (exclaims) Hey, George. You know why they call me the "The Lemonade King"? Uh... uh-uh. (smacks lips) Mm-mmm. Ahh... Free samples. Once people try this stuff, they're hooked. They can't get enough, and they bring back their friends. Mmm, this is the best ever. I'll take two, please! Wow. Sure. Ah... Oh! That gave George an idea. If people got free samples of the Man's book, maybe they'd give some to their friends, too. That'd be a great way to spread the bird word. Ooh. ahh... What you got there? Ah, The Man's Warbler book? (exclaims) With each lemonade you're going to give a free book? In business, we call that a two-for-one. Can't miss. (laughing) (hoots "Thank you") But not everyone who wanted lemonade wanted a book. Either it didn't fit on a bicycle... (gasps) Ew! ...or it was too yellow... Aw. ...or they didn't know how to read. (groans) (coins rattling) Another great sales day for the King. How'd you do? (unhappy chatter) Hmm. Looks like you need to reach more people. You should advertise! Huh? It means show what you got, so people know you're here. Check out my sign. Hmm. Hey! (hooting) 

[00:18:10]


That's the idea. You just need to put the sign where a lot of people can see it. Hmm... huh... (hoots excitedly) Now you're talking. People will see that for miles. Want some help? Yeah! (chuckles) Okay, so we need to paint something that'll really grab people. A picture with pizzazz! Boring. Boring. Super boring! Mega boring. (hoots excitedly) Bingo! Now for the paint. Sheesh, that billboard is kinda high. Uh, George, how about you paint and I'll supervise from here, okay? (chatters "Okay") Don't forget the picture. (chatters "I know") (pulleys squeaking) When George got close to the billboard, he could see things he couldn't see from far away, like the fact that the billboard wasn't just one big sheet of paper, but six sheets glued together. Hmm. (chuckles) 

[00:20:11]


That's it. Start from the center! Neatness counts. I'm here for ya, buddy. Go, go, go... Score! (George chatters) Hey, George. Are you done? Uh-huh. Uh, George... Huh? Did you paint the picture on the billboard the same size as this? Uh-huh, uh-huh. Oh, that explains it. You painted too small. I'll show you. You can't see small stuff from far away! Oh! So George resolved to paint big. (exclaims) He'd cover every last inch of that billboard. (snoring) Ha! Huh?! Who?! Oh, hi, George. How'd ya do? Huh? It looks like you painted only part of the picture. Did you run out of room? Uh-huh. George wondered how he could get a small picture onto a big billboard. Then he noticed something. Hmm. Huh? Hey! The fold marks on the picture were just like the rectangles on the billboard. Aha! (chattering) Oh, I get it. Match the rectangles here with the rectangles there. That'll work. Here, I'll make it easier. Six rectangles. Paint one at a time, and you're good to go! Ha! 

[00:22:13]


This time George was sure he'd get it right. What?! George! Come down here, quick! (hooting) (chattering) Look! You're painting the rectangles out of order (George gasps) (groans) Let's put the pictures back in order. Uh, okay, that looks good. But how do we keep them in order when you're up there? Aha! George remembered that numbers were a good way to keep track of things. You're numbering them? (hooting) Good idea! To keep everything straight, George numbered the rectangles on the billboard in the same order. Lookin' good, George! (groans) Boy, talk about a slow news day. Hey, there's a monkey painting a billboard. I wish. There's a monkey painting the billboard! Pull over! Are we rolling? This is a special report... today... live. One monkey. One billboard. One story you'll never forget. Mr. Libro, won't you please reconsider? My book is very important. Yeah. But is it funny? Well, no. See, that's a problem, 'cause I like funny. Hey, what's everybody staring at? Is that a monkey?! What's he doin'? 

[00:24:14]


Oh, no. I know that billboard. What? (Libro laughs) Look at that! A monkey painting a goofy guy with a bird on his... Wait a minute. You're the guy. Yup. It's me... and my monkey. Brilliant advertising campaign! If your book is half as brilliant as that billboard, then I'm sold! I've never seen anything like it! This book is selling like hotcakes! Well, George deserves the credit for that. (laughs) It made me laugh, it made me cry, it made me wanna donate half the proceeds to the Warbler Foundation. And there you have it-- one book, one monkey, one recipe for sales success! Reporting live from Lotsa Libros. Don't forget, save the Warbler! And try Steve's lemonade! Hey! (chatters) Boy: George is a monkey. He figured out how to make the picture much bigger. We're gonna do something that George did. I wonder how we're going to make this map of South America big enough so that it can go on this wall. People can make different parts of it. This is called a grid. When you see a pattern like this with the lines down and lines across, it's a grid. We've got our grid of South America. Each of you is going to get one part of South America to make. This small square is going to become this big square. Boy: We're going to copy everything on our small square onto a big square. She gave us a paper, and it has a little square to tell you which part of the map you're doing. And we are having lots of fun. Everybody's gonna have a partner and do a part, and they don't have to make it the same color. They can do all funky stuff 

[00:26:14]


like me and Luke did. Boy: And you can make your own bright colors. South America's a continent, one of the seven continents. Girl: There's lots of different countries in South America. We're going to put it all together, and it's going to make a big South America map. (kids cheering) Boy: It looks like South America! Teacher: Yes! (kids cheering) Abracadabra! Announcer: Pbs kids is planning a playdate so big, so gurrific it's gonna last a whole week long. Let's go camping! Announcer: Get ready for playdate week on "daniel tiger's neighborhood."

>> ?????? But dear, old mrs. Pteranodon said... ?????? 
>> oh, this is your family, and I'm your mom. You may be different, but we're all creatures. All dinosaurs have different features. Come on, buddy. We'll take a vacation. I'll get us a ticket at pteranodon station. We'll travel the world in sunshine and rain and meet all the species on the...

>> ?????? Dinosaur train ?????? 
>> ?????? dinosaur train ?????? 
>> ?????? dinosaur train ?????? 
>> ?????? dinosaur train ?????? 
>> ?????? we're gonna ride ?????? 
>> ?????? ride, ride, ride, ride ?????? [whistle blows] 
>> ?????? the dinosaur train ?????? [roaring] [captioning made possible by the jim henson company] 
>> [squawks] hurry, mom. We don't want to miss the dinosaur train. We told petey peteinosaurus we'd meet him on-board for a play date. [Train whistle blows] 
>> hey! Hey! 
>> Hey, there he is! 
>> Hello, pteranodon family. 
>> Hey! Buddy and tiny! 
>> Hi, petey! 
>> Made it! Triassic-tastic! 
>> Hello, mr. Conductor. 
>> Ha ha ha ha! All aboard! 
>> And on my way here, I saw all kinds of birds. Tons of birds, and they all had wings and a beak, just like you and me, tiny. 
>> Cool! 
>> ?????? I have wings and a beak yeah! I have wings and a beak yeah! ?????? 
>> ?????? we can glide and fly yeah! Eat bugs passing by yeah! ?????? 
>> come on, buddy. Join our conga line. 
>> Um, but I don't have wings or a beak. 
>> But you're a bird's best friend. 
>> And you have those super chomping teeth and a big, swooshy tail. 
>> Hmm. I do. 
>> ?????? My teeth chomp and chew, yeah! Check my tail out, too, yeah! ?????? ha ha ha ha! I'm really glad I'm a dinosaur, but I bet it's fun to be a bird. 
>> Not to be a nosy nellie, but if you kids like birds, have you ever heard of an archaeopteryx? 
>> Ooh! I have! It's jurassic-tastic! 
>> Jurassic-tastic? 
>> It's from the jurassic, and it's one of the first bis there is. In fact, archaeopteryx means "old wing." 
>> "Old wing"? 
>> You mean it's really old? 
>> Uh, it's--well, not necessarily. It's just called that because it's one of the earliest known birds. 
>> Hmm! Wings, beak, feathers. Yep, looks like a bird to me. 
[00:04:13]



>> I have a hypothesis. Since it's a bird, I think archaeopteryx live in a nest, just like me and tiny. 
>> And I bet archaeopteryx can fly all around, just like me and petey. 
>> One way to find out. The train's making a stop at archaeopteryx lagoon. That's where arlene archaeopteryx lives. 
>> Really? 
>> [Humming a tune] 
>> can we visit her, mom? 
>> Please? 
>> Pretty please with beetles on top? 
>> [Squawks] we can certainly stop and try to visit her. 
>> Hooray! 
>> And just in time. Time tunnel! Time tunnel approaching! [Bell ringing] next stop, archaeopteryx lagoon station in the jurassic time period. Bye! Say hello to arlene archaeopteryx for me! 
>> We will! 
>> Hello? Arlene archaeopteryx? 
>> Come out, come out, wherever you are. 
>> Hmm. Maybe mrs. Archaeopteryx doesn't want to be bothered. I mean, we don't know her, and she doesn't know we're coming here. 
>> And what if she's really old? 
>> Tiny, archaeopteryx may mean "old wing," but it doesn't mean arlene is old. 
>> Yeah, but she might be. I wonder if she's nice. Maybe she'll at least watch us do things, like play or sing. 
>> Well, you can certainly try. She may not like singing. 
>> [German accent] I love songs. I have sung for years and years and yeeeears! Woo hoo hoo hoo hoo! 
>> [Squawks] are you arlene? I mean, mrs. Archaeopteryx? 
>> Oh, pooh on being so formal. You had it right the first time. Call me arlene. And you are 4 of the luckiest youngsters I ever seen. 
>> Ha ha ha! 4? But there's just me, petey. 
[00:06:13]



>> And me, buddy. 
>> And me, tiny pteranodon. And she's not a youngster. She's our mom. 
>> To me, she's a spring chicken. Actually, a spring pteranodon. 
>> Oh, ha ha! [Squawks] why, thank you, arlene. 
>> So, what brings your smiling faces to archaeopteryx lagoon? Surely you are not just here to see me. 
>> We are here to see you. 
>> We heard a lot about you, like your name means "old wing" and that you're one of the first birds. 
>> Aren't you the smart one! It does mean "old wing," and it's true my species is one of the first birds. Well, I do happen to be older, so these wings of mine are pretty old, too. But they still flap up a good breeze, yes? Ha ha ha! 
>> [All laughing] 
>> yeah, it's pretty exciting to meet a bird from the jurassic. 
>> Oh, not just any bird. Remember, I am one of the first birds ever. But you think that stops me from doing everything you kids can do? 
>> No. 
>> Exactly. So you came here to learn about this first bird, right? Why don't you come and see my home? And we can all have a snack together. With this young lady's permission, of course. 
>> Oh. [Giggles] 
>> can we, please? 
>> We would love to. Thank you. 
> Oh, wunderbar. Oh, it's so good to have visitors. This way, everyone! Hoo hoo hoo hoo hoo! 
>> Arlene doesn't seem very old at all. 
>> You're right, buddy. 
>> Arlene is really fun. 
>> She's the coolest. I bet she knows even more flying tricks than I do. 
>> And I bet her nest is amazing. I can't wait to see it. 
>> [All giggling] 
>> willkommen. We are here. 
>> Where's your nest? 
>> Oh, I'm afraid I have to disappoint you. I don't live in a nest. 
>> What? You don't? 
>> I guess my hypothesis was wrong. 
>> But I'm sorry about your hypothesis, buddy. 
[00:08:16]



>> It's ok. 
>> Yeah, don't worry. Buddy's hypotheses aren't always right. 
>> Yeah. 
>> But, arlene, if you don't live in a nest, where do you live? 
>> Wait! You live in a tree? 
>> Whoa! 
>> Ha ha ha ha! 
>> Score! You live in a tree, and I do, too. That is such a great, birdacious place to live. 
>> Oh, ha ha ha! Oh, you're so funny, petey. Oh, you are one funny young bird. "Birdacious!" Oh, I like it! Ha ha ha! 
>> Thanks. So, can we see your home? 
>> Yeah. Let's fly up and see it. 
>> Hi. 
>> Um, it's a little hard for me. I don't have wings to fly up there. 
>> Wings, schmings. You've got lots of other things going for you, buddy. What does a big, strong, smart, handsome t-rex like you need wings for? Oh, nothing. 
>> Well, to fly up to your nest. 
>> You think wings are all that you need for that? Watch this. Are you ready for me? 
>> Yes! 
>> Come fly with us! 
>> Here goes. 
>> What happened? 
>> Did you change your mind about flying? 
>> No. That was me flying. 
>> Really? 
>> Ha ha ha! 
>> Oh. Is it because you've been flying a long time and maybe your wings are tired? 
>> Ha ha ha! You mean because I'm old. 
>> Well... 
>> No, I don't fly well because no archaeopteryx does. Remember, birds are part dinosaur, and I am more dinosaur than bird in some ways. 
>> You are? But you have wings like tiny and petey. 
>> Yes, but my bird wings have feathers. 
>> You're right. Our wings don't look the same. 
>> Has anyone noticed my tail? 
>> It's kind of like yours, buddy. 
>> Yeah. Arlene has a dinosaur tail. Do you have teeth, arlene? 
>> A full set of them. Ah! 
[00:10:19]



>> [All laughing] 
>> wow, arlene. You're the perfect combination of bird and dinosaur. 
>> And you are perfectly delightful for saying so. Now, does everyone still want to see my home? 
>> Yes! 
>> Um... 
>> I'll fly you up, buddy. 
>> Thanks, mom. Whoa! It's great up here. 
>> It works for me. It's comfortable, and I have a perfect view of any predators who might be coming. 
>> This is a lot like where I live! I love having a view! 
>> And I can easily spot the thing I most like to eat. 
>> Meat? 
>> Fish? 
>> Plants? 
>> Yeah, plants are yummy, but that's not my favorite food. My favorite thing to snack on is flying by in the air right now. 
>> Ooh! I know! Bugs! 
>> Exactly. 
>> I love bugs, to 
>> ooh! Look! Incoming! 
>> Let's get 'em! 
>> Ah! Ah! 
>> Jurassic-tastic. 
>> Hoo hoo hoo! So, what do you kids like to eat? 
>> Fish, fish, and fish. 
>> Meat for me. Our whole family eats together in a nest. 
>> Oh, your nest sounds wonderful. 
>> It's close to a big pond. We catch fish and play games and camp out. 
>> Oh! What fun! 
>> But you know what I like to do the very most, arlene? Ride the dinosaur train. 
>> We all do! 
>> Ooh, that does sound like an adventure. One day I would like to take a ride. [Train whistle blows] 
>> [squawks] speaking of which, there's the train now. Sorry, arlene. We have to go, but it was wonderful to meet you. 
>> Oh, and you, too, mrs. Pteranodon. Oh, buddy, tiny, and petey, your visit was such a treat. I will always remember it. My own kids, they live so far away. I will tell you what, you come back anytime, ok? 
[00:12:27]



>> And maybe sometime you could come to pteranodon terrace. You'lleally like our nest. 
>> There's lots of bugs flying around for snacks. 
>> I'm already looking forward to it. Now, ok, run along or fly along, but don't miss your ride. Oh, big hugs! 
>> Bye, arlene! 
>> Pleased to meet you! 
>> Thanks for the snacks! 
>> Bye! Auf wiedersehen! See you soon! [Squawks] 
>> I'm arlene, and I have... 
>> Teeth! 
>> I'm arlene. I can sort of... 
>> Fly! 
>> I'm arlene, and I have a... 
>> Tail! 
>> And I walk on two... 
>> Feet! 
>> That means I'm an... 
>> Archaeopteryx! 
>> Ha ha ha! 
>> Yeah! A dinosaur and a bird. 
>> Ok! Everyone do the arlene! ?????? Da da da da da da da! Da da da da da da! ?????? >>all laughing] 
>> hi there. I'm dr. Scott, the paleontologist, and this is archaeopteryx. 
>> Archaeopteryx. 
>> Archaeopteryx. 
>> Archaeopteryx. 
>> That's right. Now what does the archaeopteryx look like to you? 
>> It's a bird. 
>> In fact, scientists like me think that this animal was one of the first birds ever. 
>> Was it that big? 
>> No, it wasn't as big as this. In fact, it was a lot smaller. Smaller. Smaller. Perfect. Archaeopteryx was about the size of a raven. It had lots of bird features like feathered wings, but it also had many dinosaur features like teeth, a long bony tail, and a big claw on its toe. 
>> [Squawking] 
>> so, was arceopteryx a bird or a dinosaur? 
>> A bird. 
>> It's a dinosaur. 
[00:14:28]



>> Believe it or not, you're both right. Archaeopteryx is a bird and a dinosaur because all birds are part of the dinosaur family. That's right. All birds are dinosaurs. So, the next time you see a chicken, a seagull, or even a hummingbird, remember, you're looking at a dinosaur. Pretty cool, huh? Ok. Keep watching for more dinosaur discoveries. E biggest dinosaur in fact, I'm kind of tiny I don't have teeth or scary claws but it doesn't make me whiny whenever I meet someone new I march right up and what I do is say "hello there, nice to meet you, my name is tiny" I've met a lot of dinosaurs and some of them were scary and when I stand right next to them I'm kind of ordinary but if I'm friendly they are, too and then I say "it's nice to meet you" then they say, "well, hey, the same to you it's nice to meet you, tiny" ?????? 
>> hello, folks. It's me, the conductor. Ever wonder what shiny and don do at home when buddy and tiny go on the dinosaur train? Well, today we're going to find out. So come on along with me on the dinosaur train. All aboard! 
>> Ready, shiny? 
>> [Squawks] yeah. 
>> [Grunts] 
>> I got it. 
>> Yeah! Awesome! 
>> See, tiny? Twigs and mud. That's all you need to repair a nest. Now, uh, no one will know that I tripped and fell into it by accident, right? 
>> [Giggles] right, dad. 
>> [Humming a tune] one velociraptor feather, two t-rex teeth, 3 old egg shells. [Sniffs] phew! 
>> [Squawks] buddy! Tiny! It's almost time to go. You have a play date. 
>> Yeah. We're meeting ned brachiosaurus on the dinosaur train. 
[00:16:28]



>> To play junior conductors. You guys will come with us, right? It's going to be so much fun. 
>> Oh, I don't know. I think I'd rather stay around the nest with dad. 
>> I want to look around the nest for more cool things for my collection. 
>> But, don, you could look for things on the train. 
>> Yeah, I guess, but I'll just stay here with shiny. 
>> Hmm. I hear there's fish balls on the snack cart today. 
>> And ned said he'd let us ride on his neck. 
>> I bet the engineer would let us blow the whistle. 
>> That sounds like fun. But can't we do all that another day? 
>> All right. You two have a great time on the train. We want to hear all your stories when you get back. 
>> [Squawks] ok. Have fun here. 
>> Oh, I bet we will. 
>> Bye. 
>> When we get back, we can all play toss 'n' catch. Bye! 
>> So, what do we explore today? [Hums a tune] 
>> let's find someplace new so I can get more shiny things. 
>> How about...Mmm, here? 
>> That cave? Hmm...No. Caves are boring. We should go someplace else. 
>> But we've never been in there. It's somewhere new. 
>> But it's a cave. 
>> A cave is just a hole on its side. 
>> So, team pteranodon, what adventure are we thinking about for today? 
>> We're exploring a cave. 
>> We're thinking about exploring a cave. 
>> Oh. Then I'll think about it, too. Ok, let's do it! Ha ha! You see that? I "caved" in to exploring the cave. Ha ha! 
>> [Both laugh] 
>> yeah. Ok, team. Let's head to the cliff and check out that cave. 
>> Yeah. 
>> Oh, boy. [Squawks] 
>> I bet I'll find amazing things in the cave for my collection--some old teeth or fossil bones or maybe a whole skeleton. 
>> [Gulps] 
[00:18:29]



>> maybe the cave is a secret hideout for a brand-new animal we've never even seen before. An animal with big teeth and claws and-- 
>> and one that probably doesn't want us bothering it. Can we just go explore the beach? 
>> You know, shiny, you might like the inside of this cave. Caves have all kinds of surprising things in them. 
>> Like...Surprise shiny things? 
>> Oh, yes, sometimes. I say we keep our eyes peeled and our beaks bright. 
>> Hmm. 
>> What? 
>> Ahem. That means "pay attention." Heh heh heh! So? Caving? Huh? Huh? 
>> Yeah! 
>> [Gulps] caving! Go, team! Yay! 
>> You can do it, shiny. Just take a deep breath before we go into the cave. 
>> Ok, dad. [Inhales deeply] 
>> good. Let's explore! 
>> [Sighs] 
>> this is so cool! ["Cool" echoing] 
>> wow. There's an echo. 
>> I know. What a great cave! ["Cave" echoing] [water dripping] 
>> eek! What's that? 
>> Hmm. Not sure. Um... 
>> Let's see. Oh! Here it is. It's just water. Dad? Shiny? Don't be nervous. It was just dripping water. 
>> N-n-nervous? Why, I wasn't nervous. I--i just didn't see anything shiny in there. 
>> And I was just checking on your sister. Uh, you good, tiny? 
>> [Laughs nervously] 
>> she's good. 
>> But we have to explore. There could be lots of things in the cave. Shiny things. We barely went in. Come on. Let's look some more. 
>> Deep breath. 
>> [Inhales deeply] 
>> [humming] 
>> [low squawking] 
>> what's that? 
>> [Gasps] what's what? 
>> [Squawking continues] 
>> aah! What is it? Is it a monster? 
>> Shiny, it's not a monster. It's just a bird. Look. 
[00:20:32]



>> Yeah. You're one of those big pond birds. I've seen you before. You're en--you're enantiornithine, right? 
>> Yes. An enantiornithine who is trying to get some sleep, so, could you stop with the screaming? 
>> Screaming? 
>> Yeah. I wasn't screaming. I was singing. ?????? Aaah ?????? 
>> don't you mean ?????? la la looo? ?????? 
>> [squawks] intereing. Ha! Ok. I'm out of here. Bye-bye! 
>> [Sighs] ok. So we found a bird. Can we go now? 
>> Nah. I want to keep exploring. Can't we, dad? Please? 
>> Well, I say we just sit and think about this for a minute. Whoa! 
>> [Both laughing] 
>> sorry, dad. Are you ok? 
>> Yeah, I'm fine, but I'm going to have a word with this rock, that's for sure. Ha ha! Hey, kids, look at this. 
>> Wow. That rock is red. 
>> Really red. And it's shiny. 
>> Why, it sure is. Actually, shiny, this is called a mineral. 
>> A mineral? But it looks like some kind of rock. 
>> Well, team, a mineral is a solid piece that comes from the earth and is made up of the same material all the way through. And a rock is made from a bunch of different kinds of minerals. 
>> Oh! I get it. 
>> So this mineral is a ruby. The whole thing is a ruby, and that's why it's called ruby red. 
>> Are all minerals shiny and red? 
>> Well, some more than others, but they come in all kinds of colors. 
>> Purple? Blue? Green? 
>> Yes, yes, and yes, don. Diamonds, another mineral, are very clear, and they also come in green, purple, yellow, red, a whole rainbow of colors. 
[00:22:32]



>> A rainbow of shiny colors? Really? 
>> Better believe it. Diamonds sparkle more than most minerals, or that's what I'm told. I've never actually found one myself. 
>> Then what are we waiting for? Let's explore this cave and find these minerals, maybe even some diamonds. 
>> So now you want to be in the cave? 
>> I do. I really do. Just maybe you and dad can lead the way. 
>> [All humming a tune] 
>> hey, I wonder what's up there. Woo hoo! 
>> Don! Hello! Where'd you go? Don? 
>> Huh? 
>> There you are, son. Don't disappear like that. We have to stay together. 
>> Oh. Sorry, dad. 
>> Good. Everybody's here. Quite an adventure, huh? 
>> Yeah. It's a little too dark right here. Can we try to get out of the cave now? 
>> Sure. Good plan, shiny. Ok. Let's see. We came into the-- 
>> I see light. 
>> Huh. Well, me, too, don. 
>> Come on. Follow me. 
>> We'll be in the daylight in no time, shiny. 
>> Cool! 
>> [Gasps] hey, the lights are all twinkly. 
>> Wow! 
>> It's really hard. 
>> But it's so shiny and beautiful. Are these those minerals you said were the shiniest? 
>> Yeah! Are these those diamond things? 
>> You know what? I think they are. Heh! Ta-da! 
>> Ooh! 
>> Now that is one impressively shiny mineral. Hey, kids, let's take this and see how it shines outside. 
>> I like that idea a lot, dad. Look. The minerals are sparklier than ever out here. Oh! And I can see myself in all of them. [Squawks] 
>> see? It was fun exploring in the cave. You were nervous, but you made it through. ?????? La la loo! ?????? 
[00:24:40]



>> nervous? I wasn't--ok, maybe I was a little nervous, but you did a great job leading us out, don. Thanks. 
>> Shiny's right. Heh! I am pteranodon proud of both of you. 
>> I'm proud to have a dad who knows so much about minerals. 
>> Well, the reason I know so much about them is when I was a kid, I loved shiny things, like minerals, just like you, shiny. 
>> [Giggles] 
>> and I liked collecting things when I was a kid, too. 
>> Collecting things? That's like me. 
>> Yep. You're right, don. 
>> Hmm. [Train whistle blows] 
>> [gasps] the dinosaur train. Mom and tiny anduddy will be home soon. 
>> Ok, kids. Let's get back to the nest to meet them. 
>> [Squawks] 
>> here, don. You can have this ruby for your colltion. 
>> Really? Thanks, shiny. 
>> All those minerals back in the cave were so amazing. One day, we should show them to tiny and buddy. 
>> Yeah. I bet they'd ke them. 
>> Too bad we didn't bring home one of those diamonds. 
>> Hey, shiny. Hey, don. Oh, you guys missed the best trip. 
>> Yeah. We played junior conductor with ned, and we even got to toot the whistle. I wish you guys could have been there with us. 
>> Hmm. Sounds fun. 
>> How was it staying home? 
>> Good. 
>> And fun. 
>> Yeah, you know, a little of this, a little of that. 
>> This and that? 
>> We did look at some minerals. 
>> Which we found in a cave. 
>> Minerals? Will you tell us about them? 
>> Wait. First, remember we're going to play toss and catch? 
>> Yeah! Let's play! Whoo! Yeah! Over here! Catch me over here! [Giggling] 
>> [gasps] 
>> [both giggling] 
>> [squawks] hey! Wait up! [Giggles] 
>> hi. I'm dr. Scott, the paleontologist. What do you think these are? 
[00:26:42]



>> They're rocks. 
>> Good guess, but these are a little different. They're called minerals. Rocks are actually made of minerals. Most minerals form way down deep, below the surface of the earth, where it's very hot. And many minerals that we find today were around before the dinosaurs. 
>> Ooh 
>> when these shiny minerals are first discovered, they're often rough and dirty, sometimes looking like broken glass. But once they're carefully cut and polished, well, they look... 
>> Beautiful. 
>> So, whenever you see a beautiful, polished mineral, like a diamond or a ruby, think about how it formed deep within the earth long ago, maybe even before the time of the dinosaurs. All right. Remember, get outside, get into nature, and make your own discoveries.

>> Hello, folks. It's me, the conducto to meet one of the oldest birds we know. It's called an archaeopteryx. So come on along with me on the dinosaur train. All aboard! Was made possible by contributions to your pbs station from...Aur train ?????? [whistle blows] 
>> ?????? dinosaur train ?????? 
>> ?????? once upon a time there was a mom her name was mrs. Pteranodon sitting on her nest she heard a scratching and said... ?????? 
>> oh, boy! My eggs are hatching! 
>> ?????? One by one her kids popped free baby pteranodons 1, 2, 3 ?????? 
>> I'll name you tiny, shiny, and don. 
>> ?????? But tiny said... ?????? 
>> wait! There's one more, mom! 
>> ?????? Last little baby was a different size with teeth and a tail and big green eyes he didn't look anything like the rest ?????? 
>> what am I doing in a pteranodon nest? 
>> ?????? But dear, old mrs. Pteranodon said... ?????? 
>> oh, this is your family, and I'm your mom. You may be different, but we're all creatures. All dinosaurs have different features. Come on, buddy. We'll take a vacation. I'll get us a ticket at pteranodon station. We'll travel the world in sunshine and rain and meet all the species on the... 
>> ?????? Dinosaur train ?????? 
>> ?????? dinosaur train ?????? 
>> ?????? dinosaur train ?????? 
>> ?????? dinosaur train ?????? 
>> ?????? we're gonna ride ?????? 
>> ?????? ride, ride, ride, ride ?????? [whistle blows] 
>> ?????? the dinosaur train ?????? [roaring] [captioning made possible by the jim henson company] 
>> [squawks] hurry, mom. We don't want to miss the dinosaur train. We told petey peteinosaurus we'd meet him on-board for a play date. [Train whistle blows] 
>> hey! Hey! 
>> Hey, there he is! 
>> Hello, pteranodon family. 
>> Hey! Buddy and tiny! 
>> Hi, petey! 
>> Made it! Triassic-tastic! 
>> Hello, mr. Conductor. 
>> Ha ha ha ha! All aboard! 
[00:02:01]



>> And on my way here, I saw all kinds of birds. Tons of birds, and they all had wings and a beak, just like you and me, tiny. 
>> Cool! 
>> q7??? I HAVE WINGS AND A BEAK Yeah! I have wings and a beak yeah! ?????? 
>> ?????? we can glide and fly yeah! Eat bugs passing by yeah! ?????? 
>> come on, buddy. Join our conga line. 
>> Um, but I don't have wings or a beak. 
>> But you're a bird's best friend. 
>> And you have those super chomping teeth and a big, swooshy tail. 
>> Hmm. I do. 
>> ?????? My teeth chomp and chew, yeah! Check my tail out, too, yeah! ?????? ha ha ha ha! I'm really glad I'm a dinosaur, but I bet it's fun to be a bird. 
>> Not to be a nosy nellie, but if you kids like birds, have you ever heard of an archaeopteryx? 
>> Ooh! I have! It's jurassic-tastic! 
>> Jursic-tastic? 
>> It's from the jurassic, and it's one of the first birds there is. In fact, archaeopteryx means "old wing." 
>> "Old wing"? 
>> You mean it's really old? 
>> Uh, it's--well, not necessarily. It's just called that because it's one of the earliest known birds. 
>> Hmm! Wings, beak, feathers. Yep, looks like a bird to me. 
>> I have a hypothesis. Since it's a bd, I think archaeopteryx live in a nest, just like me and tiny. 
>> And I bet archaeopteryx can fly all around, just like me and petey. 
>> One way to find out. The train's making a stop at archaeopteryx lagoon. That's where arlene archaeopteryx lives. 
>> Really? 
>> [Humming a tune] 
>> can we visit her, mom? 
>> Please? 
>> Pretty please with beetles on top? 
>> [Squawks] we can certainly stop and try to visit her. 
>> Hooray! 
>> And just in time. Time tunnel! Time tunnel approaching! [Bell ringing] next stop, archaeopteryx lagoon station in the jurassic time period. Bye! Say hello to arlene archaeopteryx for me! 
[00:04:08]



>> We will! 
>> Hello? Arlene archaeopteryx? 
>> Come out, come out, wherever you are. 
>> Hmm. Maybe mrs. Arceopteryx doesn't want to be bothered. I mean, we don't know her, and she doesn't know we're coming here. 
>> And what if she's really old? 
>> Tiny, archaeopteryx may mean "old wing," but it doesn't mean arlene is old. 
>> Yeah, but she might be. I wonder if she's nice. Maybe she'll at least watch us do things, like play or sing. 
>> Well, you can certainly try. She may not like singing. 
>> [German accent] I love songs. I have sung for years and years and yeeeears! Woo hoo hoo hoo hoo! 
>> [Squawks] are you arlene? I mean, mrs. Archaeopteryx? 
>> Oh, pooh on being so formal. You had it right the first time. Call me arlene. And you are 4 of the luckiest youngsters I ever seen. 
>> Ha ha ha! 4? But there's just me, petey. 
>> And me, buddy. 
>> And me, tiny pteranodon. And she's not a youngster. She's our mom. 
>> To me, she's a spring chicken. Actually, a spring pteranodon. 
>> Oh, ha ha! [Squawks] why, thank you, arlene. 
>> So, what brings your smiling faces to archaeopteryx lagoon? Surely you are not just here to see me. 
>> We are here to see you. 
>> We heard a lot about you, like your name means "old wing" and that you're one of the first birds. 
>> Aren't you the smart one! It does mean "old wing," and it's true my species is one of the first birds. Well, I do happen to be older, so these wings of mine are pretty old, too. But they still flap up a good breeze, yes? Ha ha ha! 
>> [All laughing] 
>> yeah, it's pretty exciting to meet a bird from the jurassic. 
>> Oh, not just any bird. Remember, I am one of the first birds ever. But you think that stops me from doing everything you kids can do? 
[00:06:17]



>> No. 
>> Exactly. So you came here to learn about this first bird, right? Why don't you come and see my home? And we can all have a snack together. With this young lady's permission, of course. 
>> Oh. [Giggles] 
>> can we, please? 
>> We would love to. Thank you. 
> Oh, wunderbar. Oh, it's so good to have visitors. This way, everyone! Hoo hoo hoo hoo hoo! 
>> Arlene doesn't seem very old at all. 
>> You're right, buddy. 
>> Arlene is really fun. 
>> She's the coolest. I bet she knows even more flying tricks than I do. 
>> And I bet her nest is amazing. I can't wait to see it. 
>> [All giggling] 
>> willkommen. We are here. 
>> Where's your nest? 
>> Oh, I'm afraid I have to disappoint you. I don't live in a nest. 
>> What? You don't? 
>> I guess my hypothesis was wrong. 
>> But I'm sorry about your hypothesis, buddy. 
>> It's ok. 
>> Yeah, don't worry. Buddy's hypotheses aren't always right. 
>> Yeah. 
>> But, arlene, if you don't live in a nest, where do you live? 
>> Wait! You live in a tree? 
>> Whoa! 
>> Ha ha ha ha! 
>> Score! You live in a tree, and I do, too. That is such a great, birdacious place to live. 
>> Oh, ha ha ha! Oh, you're so funny, petey. Oh, you are one funny young bird. "Birdacious!" Oh, I like it! Ha ha ha! 
>> Thanks. So, can we see your home? 
>> Yeah. Let's fly up and see it. 
>> Hi. 
>> Um, it's a little hard for me. I don't have wings to fly up there. 
>> Wings, schmings. You've got lots of other things going for you, buddy. What does a big, strong, smart, handsome t-rex like you need wings for? Oh, nothing. 
>> Well, to fly up to your nest. 
>> You think wings are all that you need for that? Watch this. Are you ready for me? 
[00:08:21]



>> Yes! 
>> Come fly with us! 
>> Here goes. 
>> What happened? 
>> Did you change your mind about flying? 
>> No. That was me flying. 
>> Really? 
>> Ha ha ha! 
>> Oh. Is it because you've been flying a long time and maybe your wings are tired? 
>> Ha ha ha! You mean because I'm old. 
>> Well... 
>> No, I don't fly well because no archaeopteryx does. Remember, birds are part dinosaur, and I am more dinosaur than bird in some ways. 
>> You are? But you have wings like tiny and petey. 
>> Yes, but my bird wings have feathers. 
>> You're right. Our wings don't look the same. 
>> Has anyone noticed my tail? 
>> It's kind of like yours, buddy. 
>> Yeah. Arlene has a dinosaur tail. Do you have teeth, arlene? 
>> A full set of them. Ah! 
>> [All laughing] 
>> wow, arlene. You're the perfect combination of bird and dinosaur. 
>> And you are perfectly delightful for saying so. Now, does everyone still want to see my home?

>> And I can easily spot the thing I most like to eat. 
>> Meat? 
>> Fish? 
>> Plants? 
>> Yeah, plants are yummy, but that's not my favorite food. My favorite thing to snack on is flying by in the air right now. 
>> Ooh! I know! Bugs! 
>> Exactly. 
>> I love bugs, too. 
>> Ooh! Look! Incoming! 
[00:10:22]



>> Let's get 'em! 
>> Ah! Ah! 
>> Jurassic-tastic. 
>> Hoo hoo hoo! So, what do you kids like to eat? 
>> Fish, fish, and fish. 
>> Meat for me. Our whole family eats together in a nest. 
>> Oh, your nest sounds wonderful. 
>> It's close to a big pond. We catch fish and play games and camp out. 
>> Oh! What fun! 
>> But you know what I like to do the very most, arlene? Ride the dinosaur train. 
>> We all do! 
>> Ooh, that does sound like an adventure. One day I would like to take a ride. [Train whistle blows] 
>> [squawks] speaking of which, there's the train now. Sorry, arlene. We have to go, but it was wonderful to meet you. 
>> Oh, and you, too, mrs. Pteranodon. Oh, buddy, tiny, and petey, your visit was such a treat. I will always remember it. My own kids, they live so far away. I will tell you what, you come back anytime, ok? 
>> And maybe sometime you could come to pteranodon terrace. You'lleally like our nest. 
>> There's lots of bugs flying around for snacks. 
>> I'm already looking forward to it. Now, ok, run along or fly along, but don't miss your ride. Oh, big hugs! 
>> Bye, arlene! 
>> Pleased to meet you! 
>> Thanks for the snacks! 
>> Bye! Auf wiedersehen! See you soon! [Squawks] 
>> I'm arlene, and I have... 
>> Teeth! 
>> I'm arlene. I can sort of... 
>> Fly! 
>> I'm arlene, and I have a... 
>> Tail! 
>> And I walk on two... 
>> Feet! 
>> That means I'm an... 
>> Archaeopteryx! 
>> Ha ha ha! 
>> Yeah! A dinosaur and a bird. 
>> Ok! Everyone do the arlene! ?????? Da da da da da da da! Da da da da da da! ?????? >>all laughing] 
[00:12:28]



>> hi there. I'm dr. Scott, the paleontologist, and this is archaeopteryx. 
>> Archaeopteryx. 
>> Archaeopteryx. 
>> Archaeopteryx. 
>> That's right. Now what does the archaeopteryx look like to you? 
>> It's a bird. 
>> In fact, scientists like me think that this animal was one of the first birds ever. 
>> Was it that big? 
>> No, it wasn't as big as this. In fact, it was a lot smaller. Smaller. Smaller. Perfect. Archaeopteryx was about the size of a raven. It had lots of bird features like feathered wings, but it also had many dinosaur features like teeth, a long bony tail, and a big claw on its toe. 
>> [Squawking] 
>> so, was arceopteryx a bird or a dinosaur? 
>> A bird. 
>> It's a dinosaur. 
>> Believe it or not, you're both right. Archaeopteryx is a bird and a dinosaur because all birds are part of the dinosaur family. That's right. All birds are dinosaurs. So, the next time you see a chicken, a seagull, or even a hummingbird, remember, you're looking at a dinosaur. Pretty cool, huh? Ok. Keep watching for more dinosaur discoveries. 
>> Dinosaurs were big. 
>> Tiny, look at all these dinosaurs. 
>> Whoa! They're huge! 
>> Someday I'm going to be one of the biggest carnivores on land. Roar! 
>> [Deep roar] 
>> [roar] 
>> I'm a tyrannosaurus rex. 
>> Hi, mrs. Giganotosaurus. 
>> I wonder who really is the biggest dinosaur. 
>> Good question. 
>> Big, he is. Huge! 
>> Whoa! That's one big dinosaur. 
>> ?????? I'm not the biggest dinosaur in fact, I'm kind of tiny I don't have teeth or scary claws but it doesn't make me whiny whenever I meet someone new I march right up and what I do is say "hello there, nice to meet you, my name is tiny" I've met a lot of dinosaurs and some of them were scary and when I stand right next to them I'm kind of ordinary but if I'm friendly they are, too and then I say "it's nice to meet you" then they say, "well, hey, the same to you it's nice to meet you, tiny" ?????? 
[00:14:52]



>> hello, folks. It's me, the conductor. Ever wonder what shiny and don do at home when buddy and tiny go on the dinosaur train? Well, today we're going to find out. So come on along with me on the dinosaur train. All aboard! 
>> Ready, shiny? 
>> [Squawks] yeah. 
>> [Grunts] 
>> I got it. 
>> Yeah! Awesome! 
>> See, tiny? Twigs and mud. That's all you need to repair a nest. Now, uh, no one will know that I tripped and fell into it by accident, right? 
>> [Giggles] right, dad. 
>> [Humming a tune] one velociraptor feather, two t-rex teeth, 3 old egg shells. [Sniffs]

=======================================================

I say, this area it was so peaceful and beautiful just more than 24 hours ago. Now areas look like war zones. Our coverage continues with erin burnett "outfront." 
>>> "Outfront" tonight. More developments in moore, oklahoma. The city devastated by a monster tornado. The death toll changed radeically overnight. 
>>> Plus teachers risking their lives to save their students. Oklahoma's hero teachers share their story tonight. And this photograph 
-- this is what has come to define yesterday's events around the world to so many. The man in that photo joins us later in the show. Let's go "outfront." 
>>> And good evening, everyone. I'm erin burnett. Recovery in oklahoma. The mayor of the city of moore tells cnn, late today, and i want to quote him because this is the wonderful news of the day. We don have anybody missing. After yesterday's deadly 1.3-mile wide tornado, more than 100 people were pulled alive from the rubble. Moore fire chief bird said every structure searched three times and when you see these pictures and realize the magnitude of what that means, it brings home how many people worked tirelessly with no sleep to try to save lives. Cadaver dogs were searching homes in the community as you see there trying to make sure to find people, anyone alive. And some residents risked the dangers of downed power lines and debris to go through what was left of their homes. Now, the death toll changed overnight and dropped dramatically. Now standing at 24. Including nine children. Every one of those a tragedy. However, of course, early reports were there could have been as many as 100 dead. So 24 is the number tonight. At least seven of the children were killed at the plaza towers elementary school and that building is now almost completely flattened. Only a few walls actually remain. Stories of those who did survive are just starting to be heard. 
[00:02:16]



>> I had to hold on to the wall to keep myself safe because i didn't want to fly away in the tornado. 
>> We had to pull a car out of the front hallway off a teacher and she 
-- I don't know what that lady's name is but she had three little kids underneath her. Good job, teach. 
>> Another elementary school, briarwood, reduced to rubble. This one, I mean, just complete and total rubble. Another miracle, every single person in that school is alive. You can see the storm strength in this ireport video of inside a car as debris swirls around. You think miraculous this person was fine as it happened. Late today we learned the storm was stronger than we thought and at briarwood, they measured that this was the most powerful a tornado can be. The national weather service says that the peak wind estimated between 200 and 210 miles per hour, which is the fastest possible wind speed measured for a tornado. We have everything covered tonight as oklahoma tries to begin the recovery process. John king on the ground in moore. Brian todd with the firsthand look at the destruction with the tour of the mayor and quan law with the story of a family reunited after the storm. I want to start, though, with john king tonight. What's the latest on the ground now? I have seen you all day. When's the latest that you have seen? 
>> Reporter: Remarkable, erin. We had the driving rain. We had the thunderstorms, lightning. Now a glorious, sunny day and around the neighborhood, of course, anything but glorious. A family in the home behind me for several hours and collecting the gear, mostly toys for their children. There are hundreds of these. Not six or eight or ten or 12 of these. Houses just reduced, reduced to crumbs and timber and crumbled and twisted and when you think about that, when you think about that, when you see the devastation, block by block, mile by mile and understand the numbers you went through. One point this storm hitting 210 miles per hour, the tornado as it came through, I may be standing right where you said in the middle of a miracle in the sense that the numbers tonight, 24 dead, 237 injured but erin, you mentioned an important point. They're pretty confident in the numbers but the fire chief gary bird today's briefing said by the time it's dark tonight they'll go back to each of the properties he hopes three times just to be sure. Let's listen. 
[00:04:56]



>> Which we made it through I'll say most of the structures, most of the vehicles, most of the homes but the ones that we didn't make it through yesterday we'll make it through today for sure and a second and third time and be through every damaged piece of property in the city at least three times before we're done and we hope to be done by dark tonight. 
>> Reporter: And we've been in this neighborhood much of the day, different parts of this neighborhood and we were here this afternoon when they did come through. It was quiet here. We had the rain. A little hail and then swarms of search teams came through. Usually four or five to a team, most of them with a dog with them. Lifting up the debris. Opening up some of the few storm shelters, mini basements they have in the neighborhood to look and double and triple check. You have to 
-- they were exhausted. I was with one team until 2:00 in the morning to see them back on the streets this afternoon. Many of these teams also supplemented of people coming in from other states, all around the state. Heroic work by the men and the women and the dogs, the search and cadaver dogs through that work and you heard 
-- you mentioned the city manager here in moore saying a bit earlier they believe there's nobody unaccounted for and as you see the recovery effort here, a billion dollars to come ahead and the thing that counts most, lost life, as I noted we may be standing tonight in the middle of a miracle. 
>> John thing, thank you very much. As john said, with 24 dead, you know, so mard to deribe it as a miracle but it is. Last night around 1:00 in the morning eastern time we were looking at numbers close to 100 that looked like they would go so much higher. I want to bring in the lieutenant governor of oklahoma now, todd lamb. Lieutenant governor lamb, in some ways a miracle. When you' the pictures and think about how bad some of the initial reports were that so many people have been found alive and are alive. 
>> You're right. Of course, as you have alluded to, erin, if you lose one, that's too many. We're sensitive to those who have lost loved ones and lost their lives but the fact that the death toll is small relatively compared the severity of this storm and the enormity of this storm and the violence of this storm, initially we thought the death toll numbers could be significantly higher. Again, we are sorry for those that lost their lives and that we have recovered, we have recovered their bodies. Our thoughts and prayers to them. Credit goes to the rescue workers, credit goes to the early warning systems. Credit goes to the men and women of oklahoma that help each other and have rescued each other. 
[00:07:35]



>> And lieutenant governor, when we think about this, you know, you're in tornado alley and you were talking about how the tornado took essentially the same route as the horrific tornadoes of 1999 and 2003. And I know this morning you were talking about that elementary school where the children have lost their lives, plaza towers. I want to quote you. You said they had a basement and why some of the children drowned. Were the schools properly prepared for the storm? It seems like some were very prepared and some maybe not. 
>> Well, you know what? It's easy to look on tuesday afternoon and look back at what happened on monday and point fingers and say somebody was prepared or ill prepared. The reality is, if the safety measures were not taken in the way in which they were, we very well could have had a greater loss of life than we had. The fact that we had very limited loss of life in one school, if not any loss of life and then another one where we had loss of life but it was mitigated by the fact that those educators and teachers, superintendent, principal, all those educators on campus did all that they could to save those children. 
>> You're sure at this point, lieutenant governor, everyone is accounted for, no one missing, no child or adult at this point? 
>> Erin, I'm trying to get the information I could all day. I knew that we would be visiting again this evening and had several intews throughout the day. The first time I heard that everybody was accounted for was just now on your program so I'll do my best to confirm that. Of course, I want to be very sensitive to the fact I don't say too much or information that may not be accurate. That may very well be but the first time I heard it so you might have breaking news on that fact. 
>> All right. Well, thank you very much, lieutenant governor. And again, for our viewers, it was the mayor of the city of moore that just told us late today that we don't have anybody missing but as you hear from the lieutenant governor they're still trying to ascertain and john king reporting once again going door to door and will have gone in to every structure, remains of the truck which you are at least three times to confirm they have found everyone. A day after the city was devastating by the tornado, the mayor inspected the damage and we're going to go along with him, you'll see what he saw today. We'll be right back. Are you still sleeping? Just wanted to check and make sure that we were on schedule. The first technology of its kind... Mom and dad, I have great news. Is now providing answers families need. Siemens.

>>> We are following the breaks news on the deadly oklahoma tornado. Tonight, officials assessing the damage say that at this point late today they were able to determine that there were signs this tornado at some point was an ef-5 and that means it's the most powerful tornado that can be recorded with winds that go up to 210 miles per hour. Yesterday, we had reported that the winds were somewhere between 166 and 200 so these were north of 200 and up to 210. Those winds destroyed neighborhoods, leveling a city block after block. The miracle, it appears tonight that only 24 people have died. They say no one is still unaccounted for but the numbers could change. Today cnn looked at the destruction. And brian todd went through some of the blocks with the city's mayor. 
>> Reporter: We drove past blocks and blocks of shredded homes, mangled cars and fallen power lines. This is just one of the devastated neighborhoods in moore, oklahoma. The mayor, glen lewis, showed us some of the hardest hit areas. He's trying to get a handle on the scope of the destruction on the town he's lived in all his life. How overwhelmed do you feel? 
>> Pretty overwhelmed. It's going to be a mess to clean this !Up. So 
-- but we'll do it. 
>> Reporter: The mayor took us to the ruins of the moore medical center where a pregnant woman went in to labor as the storm hit. 
>> The doctors and nurse stayed with her and she completed the birthing process. 
>> Reporter: While this was going on? 
>> Uh-huh. 
>> Wow. 
>> Reporter: Did they successfully get her and her child out of there? 
>> Yep. As a matter of fact, they said there was no injuries any of the patients or staff. 
>> Reporter: Rescue and recovery teams have completed a sweep of the medical center and the parking lot that looks like a junkyard now. OFFICIALS SAY THE "Xs" MARK THE Fact there's no live bodies inside the structure and the mayor says that doesn't mean there aren't any bodies and that's why they have the canine teams out combing the wreckage for bodies. Some places in moore still too dangerous for us to get close to, officials urge residents to stay away from their homes for now so emergency workers make sure no one else gets hurt. 
[00:15:53]



>> The biggest concern now for the citizens and then for my men and all the people that have come in to help just to be sure they're safe and the citizens understand we're doing the best we can of getting there as fast as we can. 
>> Brian, public officials telling people not to go back to the homes. Where then are people staying? 
>> Reporter: They're saying it to the people because they say even though it's more than 24 hours after the tornado hit, it's still not safe to go back to your home. There are downed power lines all over the place. We had toavigate through a lot of those today combing through the neighborhoods. There are gas leaks all over the place. All of it, fire hazard and a lot of people don't realize the hazards around the homes picking through some of the wreckage and just trying to pick up heirlooms and things like that. It's not safe. The police chief stillings told me about that, trying to secure the area. Doesn't help when people! Try to come back and pick through the homes. You understand why they're doing it but it's very dangerous. 
>> All right. Thank you very much, brian todd. Just amazing seeing those pictures. Again, just reminding us all about the fact that with 200,000 people in the storm's path right now we understand are 24 who have lost their lives and horrible tragedy in every single life but you look at this and think that it could have been so much more horrific. There are so many unforgettable images we have been seeing since this storm hit an I want to show you one that was taken by a storm chaser. This storm chaser captured the tornado as it cut through the community of moore and I want to show it to you now. 
>> Kevin, get the pictures, man. I'm getting the video. I've never heard a roar like that before. 
[ Siren ] oh my gosh. It just turned north! Very large wind tornado heading in to moore, oklahoma. Hold on. It's going to our north. 
[00:18:00]



>> I know that. 
>> I have never heard a roar like that before. This tornado and the devastation hitting home for another storm chaser tracking more than 100 storms, dave holder, lives in norman, oklahoma, next to moore. Dave, you heard that storm chaser say, I have never heard a roar like that. You were covering tornadoes yesterday when this one hit. Now you've seen the damage. Have you ever seen anything like this? 
>> No. It's definitely once in a 
-- first time I've ever seen anything like this. It's completely overwhelming. We got in there a few minutes after it happened and I was just in a total state of shock. I've never seen anything like it. 
>> And you have 
-- I mean, you have covered more than 105 tornadoes, I believe. And tell me if that number is wrong but I wonder, dave, you think about it where you live and what you do, is the risk of something horrific like this tornado happening, this experience, something you accept as someone who lives the that you know will happen to you or do you think, yeah, I know that it might happen but it won't ever happen to me? 
>> No. I'm actually always kind of worried during the springtime and I always tell the people in norman, I'm always a little on edge because I know that these violent tornadoes happen and i know that they can happen anywhere. For whatever reason, moore, i mean, it is so sad. They just keep getting them. They're really strong, violent tornadoes that rip through the city. I guess, the third time in 14 years but norman itself had a few close calls and nothing like this. No. I mean, I know living here, it's a risk and I'm always very, very aware of it. You know, I tell my 
-- I talk to my mom a lot about it. One of these days it might come through norman but, I mean, it wasn't norman this time but way too close to home and too close for comfort. 
>> Thank you very much and yet another person saying how unprecedented this is and in dave's case, chase more than 105 storms amid the death and destruction in moore, ok objection, there were a number of remarkable moments of heroism and sacrifice. The moments you can't believe. And yet, they happen. And we're going to bring you one of the most incredible stories next. siragusa and I've been around the toughest guys in football.

>> There's no way. I'm sorry. 
>> Reporter: Across town, his daughter jenna who rode out the tornado where she works and knew briarwood elementary next door to the day care was flattened. For three hours she was trapped behind live electal wires texting for news of her sons. 
>> The three hours I didn't hear anything were the longest three hours of my life. Knowing that I may never see them again. No mother should ever have to go through that. No. 
>> It's hard and there are, you know, a lot of kids we were seeing were school age. 
>> Reporter: Children were being rushed in to children's hospital. 51 patients came in to dr. Bob's trauma ward but that wasn't the hard part of the night for him. 
>> Yeah, it's 
-- it's 
-- it hurts. Because you know if they could get to you, you have half a chance but a lot of them never got here and I'm not sure whether they needed to be here or not. 
>> Reporter: In the stream of children in the emergency room, little grayson, his ear hurt, a bad wound to his head. His baby brother 
-- 
>> I rescued my baby. 
>> Unscathed because their day care teacher covered them with a mattress and her own body. Amazingly, no one in the day care center died. 
>> It is a miracle. It's an absolute miracle. 
>> Reporter: Grayson is shaken as you might imagine. 
>> What happened at day care? 
>> Bad! 
>> Reporter: It broke? 
>> Yeah. 
[00:26:23]



>> Reporter: But he's quickly on the mend and ready to play. 
>> Reporter: Oh, you got me. One family's lucky turn who understands there's so many neighbors who are not. 
>> I'm sorry. We'll be praying for you and your family. It's all I can do. 
>> Reporter: We are delighted to tell you that grayson is being discharged from the hospital tonight. He and his family heading home. Erin, their house was not damaged by the tornado. 
>> Oh wow. Just incredible. Those pictures, I just love that. Looking at them right now as you go with the stuffed animal. Hmm. All right. Thank you very much. With one of those stories that makes you smile amidst all that devastation that we're seeing. In the middle of all of the havoc, there were moments of real heroism, as well. We'll hear from a teacher who risked her own life to save the lives of her students. And in their minds now, she will forever be a heroine. This image is a front page image around the world.

>>> we start the second half of our show with stories where we focus on our reporting from the front lines. Of course, our main story tonight, the devastation and recovery in oklahoma. We are also following the irs story. The official in charge of the division that targeted conservative groups says she is going to invoke the fifth amendment right against self incrimination before lawmakers tomorrow. She's admitted publicly to scrutinizing the groups and made the intentions known in a letter to representative issa. Two tea party groups filed lawsuits against the irs alleging harassment and privacy issues. One of them true the vote is seeking damages of $85,000 and jeffrey toobin says the lawsuits won't succeed, this is a political issue and will have a politicalresolution. 
>>> New developments in the coming presidential election in iran. An important thing for all americans, the body that vets candidates approved eight to run for president. One person absent of the list is the protege soft current president mahmoud ahmadinejad. A man an expert says was a long shot anyway. Former iranian president was also snuffed. This likely means that conservative closer to the supreme leader will likely be the next president. The first round of voting begins JUNE 14th. 
>>> In a dramatic statement made to jurors today, jodi arias pleaded that her life be spared instead of asking the jury to sentence her to death as you're all aware she wanted in an interview. She called the murder of her ex-boyfriend the worst mistake she ever made and could be constructive and positive in prison. The question, though, is whether jurors believe her. Legal analyst paul cowan says it could backfire if the jury sentencing decision is not unanimous, a new panel will be selected. It must be a unanimous decision. 
>>> Apple ceo tim cook defended the company's tax strategy on capitol hill today. The senate panel is looking in to allegations that apple has avoided billions of dollars in taxes by shifting ince to overseas subsidiaries. The fact that apple has billions and billions and billions of dollars overseas to pay less tax is a fact and cook claims it's a high effective tax rate and that figure is based on profits in the united states. And the problem is they have a billion dollars overseas in cash which is often taxed at much lower races so you can see the problem. Nicklas thomas says they've done great things and shown it's as creative of dodging taxes as building things. 
[00:34:06]



>>> It's 656 days since the u.S. Lost the top credit rating. Today stocks ended the day at record highs. 
>>> All right. Along with countless scenes of destruction in oklahoma, there have been images of relief and gratitude and reunion, including this one which is resonating around the world. A man hugging a little boy. His neighbor who survived the tornado's destruction at the briarwood elementary school. Here's the scene as this frightened first grader first saw a familiar face. "Outfront" tonight, the man in that video with his daughter and also I believe ezekial with you, too, that story and picture is incredible. What happened in your mind when you're sitting there with all that fear and you saw him? 
>> Well, I'm just sitting there. I was just relieved to find him. He was just 
-- to see something familiar and to know that he was okay, I knew he was there at the school and just to see him and know that he was okay and didn't have any cuts or bruises or anything and it was very 
-- it was an emotional connection that we had but it was very real and it was very rewarding, very satisfying. 
>> And I don't know if he can hear me but, hezekiah what went through your mind when you saw your neighbor and realized it was someone you knew? 
>> What went through your mind when you first saw me and you knew it was big dog? 
>> Well, when I saw you, I ran up to you and I just jumped on you and I knew that you were going to pick me up so I just jumped and you picked me up and I just started hugging you really hard and, like, I was crying a little bit. And I was happy that I survived. 
[00:36:27]



>> Jim, when you hear him say that, how do you feel? You were that 
-- you were that light for him. 
>> Yeah. I felt like 
-- I felt like maybe I needed that hug as much as he did at that time. It was just 
-- it was so much chaos and it was so chaotic and we just weren't sure, you know, the school was pretty much devastated and mostly destroyed and we weren't sure if anyone was going to come out alive and to go over and see one of my favorite neighbors, child, emerge, it was 
-- it was awesome. It was just an amazing feeling. It was awesome. 
>> You were the first to see him running there towards your dad. What did you think at that moment when you don't know who's alive and see that little boy who I know is so important in your father's life? 
>> I just 
-- I saw him when i came 
-- I came around the corner and I saw that the school was gone and took off running. I was like, he's in there. I need to find him. As soon as I saw him, he turned around and screamed my name and ran in to my arms and it was the best feeling ever to know he was safe and alive. 
>> I wanted to ask him, how does he feel now? Does he want to go back to school? Or not? 
>> How do you feel now, do you want to go back to that school or not? 
>> I don't really want to go back to the school unless there's another one. If there's another one, I just want to, like, stay away from it and go to a different school so that I don't have to go through it again. 
>> And jim, does this 
-- you were already close to him. He's very special to you. What does this do for your relationship? 
>> Well, he's a special little man and I think this will just 
-- this will enrich our relationship as far as that goes. He'll just continue to be the same little dog. My little dog. He calls me big dog and I call him little dog and when we're playing basketball or whatever so he was just 
-- he just said I'm so glad to see you big dog whenever he ran to me so it was pretty special. 
[00:38:59]



>> And does it surprise you or can you believe that that picture, your picture of the two of you, big dog and little dog, is 
-- I mean, the whole world has seen it. It's become an image of joy and recovery. That picture of the two of you. Can you believe that? 
>> No. I can't. It's 
-- you know, but it's thanks to the media outlet that is are getting the types of stories and these types of pictures out for everyone that actually helps us, you know, to the healing process and helps us to learn and see that we have to depend on one another. We have to depend on one another to get through these types of things and we're oklahomans and that's the oklahoma spirit. I mean, we've been through this. We get through it. And by the grace of god we'll rebuild and clean up and move on. 
>> Well, thank you so much and that image has given so many just a light and a ray of hope. Thanks to jim and shanna and hezikiah. 
>> Okay. Thank you. 
>>> We're learning that that tornado at one point was an ef-5. As we have been explaining, that's the highest classification that a tornado can receive. At the time when the ef-5 was struck, winds between 200 and 210 mirps. That's up to 50 miles per hour faster, nearly 50 miles faster than that they thought it might have been when it struck briarwood elementary school. That's where he was in school. This school is completely and utterly gone. He and every other child though managed to survive and ed lavandera is out front to talk about the heroes, teachers who put their lives on the line to save him and every one of the classmates. 
>> Reporter: These are the frantic moments after the tornado struck brianwood elementary school in moore, oklahoma. Chaos instantly wrapped in the comforting arms of parents and teachers. Snapshots that captured the emotion, words can't fully do justice. This is where we find tammy and her second grade class. 
[00:41:18]



>> I can't even describe what was going through my head. I was numb. 
>> Reporter: As the tornado sirens blaired and teachers moved students to safe positions, tammy stepped outside. 
>> Reporter: This is what you saw just 
-- 
>> right before we went in. 
>> Reporter: She snapped this picture of the twister barrelling at the classroom. She raced inside and courtroomed about 20 students in to a closet and bathroom. 
>> Reporter: What do you tell a bunch of second grade little kids? At that moment? 
>> Before shut the doors, because the bathroom had doors, I said I love you. The boys looked at may little strange. Walked in the girls and said, i love you. They all said, I love you back. I told them to pray and that's what we did the whole time in the closet is prayed. 
>> Reporter: Do you think they grass ped what was about to happen? 
>> I'm not really sure. They were all singing the national anthem. We 
-- we're about to have a program in two days and perform the national anthem so they were practicing. They were just trying to forget what was actually happening. 
>> Reporter: For tammy, the horrors seemed to never end. 
>> I just assumed that they would be quick. But it just stayed and stayed and stuff was falling on us. We had books over our heads. And I looked 
-- glanced up once and you could just see it. It was just like brown, huge and never ending. Just all the way up to the heavens. And then I got back down a cinder block fell on the back of my neck. 
>> Reporter: The only section of the school somewhat intact is the bathroom and a couple of teachers tammy included decided to move the students in there at the last second and then everything erupted. The walls caving in. The car blown in to the side of the wall. With students on the other side, it could have been devastating. The teachers decided to move those students in to that area and that's what saved their lives. Despite what you see here, everybody at the school survived the tornado strike. There were lots of tears but tammy says the students were brave. 
[00:43:35]



>> I mean, they were calm. 
>> Reporter: Really? 
>> Surprisingly very calm. 
>> Reporter: Why do you think that is? 
>> I think they felt safe. We did our best to take care of them and make them feel loved and secure. 
>> Reporter: As we talked, she found a muddy paper that brought tears to her eyes. Was an end of year award? 
>> Yep. Supposed to be given in a couple of days. 
>> Reporter: A beautiful handwriting award a little boy named jackson was supposed to receive this week. Tammy won't let the tornado take away what jackson earned. 
>> Reporter: What do you want to tell your students if you could see them right now? 
>> I love them. I miss them. We have three days left but i just 
-- I want to make sure they're all right. 
>> Ed, it's just amazing to watch that when you realize what people are capable of. Briarwood, it's gone. You showed the bathroom only thing standing but do any of the schools have shelters or not? 
>> Reporter: You know, it's interesting. Tammy has an older son in high school. Not too far away from there. It's a school built in the last ten to 15 years and that school has a shelter, a safe place where all of the students can be rushed in to and huddled in to one safe place enolder schools don't have them necessarily. We spoke with a lot of people today saying 
-- say we need to have the conversation about whether or not these shelters need to be put in and whether the money should be spent to put in the shelters at all of the schools around oklahoma given how much this state has to battle tornadoes. It's not something to go away and heard it from several people today, erin. 
>> We were talking to a student at the briarwood school and he was saying he wasn't sure he wanted to go back to the school, but you have talked to teachers, to people who are there. Do they see this as a miracle? You know, today when we first found out this is one of the most powerful tornado there is. That evidence came from briarwood and yet every child survived. 
[00:45:39]



>> Reporter: You know, someone like tammy I think probably speaks for what many of the teachers must be feeling. You turn around and look at what's left behind and what you essentially have emerged out of and you walk away scratching your head. No real way to explain how everyone could have survived and why it was that the structure around the bathrooms and the one closet where the kids huddled in, you know, were able to walk away from that. They walk away in amazement. 
>> It is just 
-- it is incredible. As you see those images next to ed and then you see those children and then you think of that image of jim and hezikiah embracing and the stories of survive. Ed, thank you very much. 
>>> Still tocome, chris cuomo in the air this afternoon to see the damage. As we have been telling you, this tornado hit at an area where 200,000 people live. And you can see the images of rubble and devastation but from the air what does it look like? Chris is going to show you those pictures after this. ah... relax, pull out the paper and what?

[ Male Announcer ] TODAY, MEN WITH LOW T Have androgel 1.62% testosterone gel. The #1 prescribed topical testosterone replacement therapy increases testosterone when used daily. Women and children should avoid contact with application sites. Discontinue androgel and call your doctor if you see unexpected signs of early puberty in a child, or signs in a woman, which may include changes in body hair or a large increase in acne, possibly due to accidental exposure. Men with breast cancer or who have or might have prostate cancer, and women who are or may become pregnant or are breast-feeding, should not use androgel. Serious side effects include worsening of an enlarged prostate, possible increased risk of prostate cancer, lower sperm count, swelling of ankles, feet, or body, enlarged or painful breasts, problems breathing during sleep, and blood clots in the legs. Tell your doctor about your medical conditions and medications, especially insulin, corticosteroids, or medicines to decrease blood clotting. In a clinical study, over 80% of treated men had their t levels restored to normal. Talk to your doctor about all your symptoms. Get the blood tests. Change your number. Turn it up.

>>> All right. Want to check in with anderson cooper with a look at what's coming up on "ac 360." Hi, anderson. 
>> Hey, erin. We are live from moore, oklahoma tonight. You've probably seen the amazing video of a mom finding her son at his school right after the tornado, her son was alive and well, and her thanking the teacher who kept her son safe. Tonight we reunite the mom and the teacher. It is an amazing story of courage and strength. We'll also meet another teacher whose quick thinking enabled her to keep her students safe. She grabbed several students, rushed them into a closet at plaza towers elementary. We'll also speak with her husband who raced to the school realizing the school was in danger to try to help in the search and rescue efforts. We've heard a lot about storm shelters and how they save lives. Gary tuchman will take us inside one of them to see how they're built. He'll tell us why more people don't have them in this area. Of course, all the latest on the ongoing search here. There is so much to cover. It begins at the top of the hour. 
>> Really looking forward to seeing you in a few minutes. 
>>> You know, when the tornado touched down in moore on monday, it caught a lot of people off guard. You know, a big part of the reason for that is there actually had been a rather big lull in severe storms and tornadoes so far in 2013. Prior to this tornado, only about half the usual number of tornadoes for this time of year had actually been reported, which is a pretty stunning drop. Unusually cool and dry conditions in southern states reduced tornado activity by denying spring storms what they need, which is moist, warm air. And that is what fuels tornadoes. Yet what might amaze you is that even with fewer storms, america still has the bulk of the entire planet's tornado activity. That brings me to tonight's number, 75%. That is the percentage of the world's tornadoes that occur in america. Every year, the united states averages between 800 and 1,000 recorded tornadoes. The number two country on the list is canada, and they only get about 100. By the way, yes, you would note canada is cooler so it doesn't necessarily have to be southern. But the question is why are so many in the united states. According to the discovery channel, it's a combination of things. Geography is one of them, climate is another and topography is another. Because america, which is home to the area known as tornado alley, which sort of hugs there that midwestern corridor, missouri, kansas, oklahoma, has a lot of flat low-lying geographic regions and a climate that's conducive to intense thunderstorms, and those obviously are required for tornadoes. Now, when you hear that laid out it may sound plausible but it still doesn't really answer why there's such a discrepay in the numbers. You know, I've traveled and in other parts of the world there's a lot of places that seem not unlike tornado alley yet they don't experience the same level of severe storms. It's a pretty incredible thing when you think about it and it goes to show us how little we understand about nature and why what happens, happens.

>>> For the pictures we've been showing you on the ground in oklahoma, you can see the devastation. But when you see the damage from the air, to an area 200,000 people live in, it gives an even greater sense of the destruction. Chris cuomo literally just got off a helicopter going over the affected area of the 17 mile long path of the tornado, and here is what he saw. 
>> We're going to take you through the tornado's path beginning to end. If you look down, you see the debris field. There's a brown line going across that field. That is the tornado's path. You'll see what happens when that path starts to get into a populated area. Look at the difference. Between having your home intact and having it just be piles of splinters. At its widest point the tornado was 1.3 miles wide. But it's the area of concentration that was much more narrow. What you're looking down at now is where we were this morning. The big building is the movie theater. Next to it is the bowling alley. You'll see the little brown strips where the alleys were. Next to that is the medical center which is completely decimated. 
[00:58:41]



>> Chris, it's amazing looking at your pictures there, when you were showing that brown path in the fields, when it wasn an unpopulated area, it seemed so innocuous and frankly, rather small. Then all of a sudden, it's this massive populated area. When you first saw that switch from rural to the suburbs, when it hit where people lived, what did you see when you saw that point of impact? 
>> Reporter: Well, there's such intentionality to it, right? It looks like it just takes a course, a familiar course here. I was listening earlier on as i was getting wired up and you were talking about why this place. There are other places that have different aspects to it, similar aspects, and it's a strong point. I don't know the answer to it but I do know this. In '99, 2003 and with this tornado, the path has been very similar. So these same paths of community have dealt with the same risk and it raises questions about what type of prevention there is. But there's also warning fatigue on the other side of it where people are so used to hearing about the next big one that they stop 
-- they start to not believe that the risk is great as they're being told. But the real reason we wanted to go in the air was to show the randomness, the difference between who made it and who

=======================================================

10,000 people affected by this tornado. That does it for us tonight. Thanks for watching. We'll be back here in moore, okl oklahoma, tomorrow night. Erin burnett "outfront" starts now. 
>> "Outfront" we're going to go live to moore, oklahoma. We know why. Plus, amid death, the destruction, the remarkable moments of harrow i. And sacrifice. We'll bring you one of the most incredible stories next. And the picture that has bec an image, a symbol of hope for people around the world. You're going to meet that man and that little boy tonight. Let's go out front. 
>> I'm erin burnett and "out fr front" front tonight, a special edition. Breaking news. We have learned that 2400 homes have been damaged by the tornado in the oklahoma city area. 10,000 have been directly affected by the storm. The city has now gone from rescue and searching to recovery. Now the death toll stands at 24, dramatically lower than officials have first indicated. But the number is still tragic. Nine children have lost their lives. Tonight, we're learning a little bit more about those children. She was nine years old and her father remembered her as a ball of energy, a ball of love. That building is now almost completely flattened. The stories of those who did survive are today just starting to be heard. 
>> I had to hold onto a wall to keep myself safe. 
>> We had to pull a car out of a front hall way off a teacher. I don't know what that lady's name is, but she had three little kids underneath her. 
[00:02:08]



>> Teachers, heroes, another local elementary school. We were able to determine the speed of the storm and how fast it was. But, miraculously, every single person out there made it alive. More than 100 people had been pulled alive from 1700 miles of the tornado. Trying to pick through their homes. Now, we want to show you this video that we were able to obtain. This is shot from inside a car. You can see the little black pieces. It's like giant pieces of wood. Last night, we were telling you ey could have been between 166 and 200. And from the low end of where we are now, significant difference and wind speed. 
>> You've been speaking to the mayor and saying look, we think, we hope, that we have accounted for everyone. 
>> I think the headline of the story right now is that the death toll is not higher. 24 is a horrible number, but the mayor says he hopes it doesn't go higher than 24. What we saw in joplin two years ago, where 159 people died, this is significant damage. So the fact that it's 24 is a bit surprising. Tragic, but it could have been much higher. What I can tell you is a great number of those 2400 were destroyed. Today was a lot of people returning to homes that are no more. 
[00:04:20]



>> Reporter: A cold downpour accompanied residents of moore, oklahoma, as they returned to destroyed homes for the first time. Patterson drive looked nothing like they remembered it. 
>> On the way here, I've seen so much other damage. Pardon me for this. 
>> Alyssa lived here with her husband, two small children and two dogs. They evacuated but left the dogs behind. 
>> This is the bedroom. 
>> Yes. 
>> Reporter: The damage is devastating. 
>> Reporter: Where did you find your dogs? 
>> Inside the bathtub right by the toilet. 
>> Reporter: Josephine martin and stephanie smith are step sisters. 
>> Walking down the street, we couldn't tell which house was ours. This was the main entrance. This is the kitchen. 
>> This is your bedroom? 
>> Yep, this is my bedroom. Mainly, it seemed like the back wall was what was ripped away on my window sill. My closet was perfectly in tact. 
>> There are dozens and does ps of patterson drive. Streets that were december mated in less than 1 minute. Streets full of residents who now have to start over. 
>> Some things can never be replaced. 
>> Where is your living room? 
>> Over there underneath her roof. 
>> Maybe you'll be able to get the photo albumings. 
>> I'm hoping so. We've got to get that roof moved. 
>> And just before we left alyssa's home. 
>> That's my engagement photos. I feel great. 
[00:06:22]



>> We see it time and time again when we cover tornadoes and hurricanes. You'd expect sometimes people run back to their houses and LOOK FOR TVs OR CLOTHING. But what people look for, we see it all of the time, the moe men toes, the heirlooms, the books that they've handed down and definitely those pictures. That's the human spirit. Jerry, I just want to ask you, just getting the latest situation update from your office. This is still 24 fatalities. But I guess let me just start with that question then, about the fatalities. Do you feel confident that it is 24? To be honest with you, I wish i could give you something concrete. We hope that it remains at 24. But until the medical examiner releases that officially, we're not going to be able to confirm that one way or the other. Gh and from your perspective and what you've been dealing with, the significant discrepancies and a number of those who lost their lives, how has that confusion made your job more difficult? 
>> You know, we really try not to focus on the number that is are coming in. We know that everything is volatile. Everything that's happening is preliminary. We take the information from the rescuers and try to distill that so it becomes accurate for us. But our duty as far as giving resources and to focus on the rescuers to help them accomplish their mission doesn't really change. So we just focus on the task at hand. 
[00:08:30]



>> And I know that you have been doing that for years, 30 years you were a firefighter in this distrix. This storm, so many people I've spoken to, storm chasers say this is unprecedented in terms of the damage. Is that also what you think, jerry? You've never seen anything worse? 
>> I try not to compare. I mean, I look at the amount of damage that was done in '99. And we've done an overlay that this tornado follow up. When you look at nothing that's left but a foundation and you set those side-by-side and they look so much similar that it's really difficult to differentiate. It's just unbelievable that a louse can be nothing left but a foundation. 
>> Jerry, thank you very much again for taking the time. I know you and your team have really not been able to sleep. So, thank you. Now, tonight, we are getting a better look at the devastation that jerry is talking about left behind from the tornado in moore, oklahoma. And as we just learned, 2400 homes are damaged. He went through the area today in moore. 
>> We drove passed blocks and blocks of shredded homes, mangled cars and fallen power lines. This is just one of the devastated areas in moore, oklahoma. The mayor showed us stom of the hardest hit areas. He's trying to get a scope of the destruction in the town he's lived in all of his life. 
>> How overwhelmed do you feel right now? 
>> Pretty overwhelmed. It's going to be a mess to clean this up. 
>> A local councilman told us what happened next. 
[00:10:31]



>> The nurse that was in there, she completed the birthing process. 
>> While this was going on? 
>> Yes. 
>> And they said there was no injuries. 
>> Rescue and recovery teams have completed a sweep of the medical center and the parking lot that looks like a junk yard now. 
>> CITY OFFICIALS SAY THESE Xs On vehicles and other things mark the fact that there are no live bodies inside the struck you areture. The mayor says that's why the canine teams are out. 
>> There are some place ins moore that are still dangerous for us to get close to. 
>> The biggest concern now for citizens and then for my men and all the people that have come in and help, just to be sure they're safe and be sure the citizens understand the best they can. 
>> The fire chef says first responders are still working around the clock. Says they'll go through every damaged property at least three times.

>>> Welcome back to a live edition of "outfront." Tonight, as the victims and their neighbors are beginning the tremendous and monumental task of rebuilding their lives, we're hearing tales of harrowism. We're hearing responders and residents not everyone from moore all coming to help those in need in the aftermalt math of destruction. Ben, you helped pull 15 people from a building that collapsed next to the hospital. I want to ask you about them. But when you first got there, what was the scene like. And could you hear people crying for help? 
>> Boy, erin, we followed the mile-wide tornado northbound of i-35. There was a bunch of debris showering down all over our vehicle. If that wasn't enough, we pulled up and saw a hospital had been levelled. At that point, with my e.M.T. Training, the best thing to do was to aid the victims. There was a particular building that collapsed, it was a large concrete slab that fell on top of nurses and other medical staff. We were able to get a lot of them out. 
>> What was the condition of those people that you saw rescued. 
>> 
>> Most people were not wanting to move. We told them this was a very fluid situation. The concrete was shifting. 
>> There was so many bystanders that wanted to help, the concrete started to shift and collapse even more. In a situation like that, you want to get everybody out as fast as possible. It was a situation where we had to get them out quickly. As far as I know, everyone made elt out okay. 
[00:17:54]



>> As you say, thank god that you were there and able to help them with that concrete shifting and the first one there. And I know obviously that's dangerous and something a lot of people obviously shouldn't and don't do. You've been chasing these storms since high school. Have you seen any one like this one? At what moment did you ralize this was different. 
>> What happened over new castle, we had a rope funnel come down. It went from a rope funnel to a mile-wide wedge. In 1999, it was on the ground for several minutes coming up in the southwest part of the city. It formed right over really limiting leave time. 
>> Really, as you describe it, incredible to imagine. Thank you so much. I really appreciate you taking the time. And amidst all of the death and destruction, there are remarkable stories of survival and reunion. She met one family whose story will awe you. 
>> They knew where it was going. 
>> If you could just see it pulling up everything and it was on a beline course straight toward this day care. 
>> What was left of the day care is 3-year-old and 6-week-old boys inside. 
>> You can't help but operate it. There's no way. 
>> Across town, his daughter, jenna. She already knew briarwood elementary. Next door to the day care was flattened. For three hours, she was trap ped with live electrical wires. 
[00:20:07]



>> It was the longest three hours of my life. It's hard. 
>> Children were being rushed into children's hospital. 51 patients came in the trauma ward. But that wasn't the hard part of the night for him. 
>> Yeah, it's 
-- it hurts because you know if they can get to you they got a chance, I'm not sure whether they needed to be here or not. 
>> Little grayson, his ear hurts, a bad wound to his head, his baby brother. 
>> That was my baby. 
>> Your baby. 
>> Unscathed. 
>> Her teacher covered them with a mattress. 
>> It's a miracle. An absolute miracle. 
>> Grayson was a little bit shaken, as you might imagine. 
>> What happened? It broke? 
>> Yeah. 
>> But he's quickl on the mend and ready to play. One family's lucky turn understands there are so many neighbors who are not. 
>> I'm sorry. I will be praying for you and your family. 
>> What kinds of doctors are seeing the children? 
>> Doctors see the typical type of children. They see the scrapes, spinal cord injuries. They also see various crush injuries. Doctor ares expecting multiple serious head trauma. That's why the miracle they were seeing they think it was on other children, as well. 
[00:22:27]



>> It's just amazing. When you look at the devastation and how many es scaped. Thank you very much. It's another example of those miracles. Tonight, workers at the moore medical center are counting their blessings. The top floor of that building was ablg chully torn off. I know you had a chance to speak up with dr. Stephanie barnhart. I just want to play what she said to you when you asked her about it. 
>> You were the e.R. Doc on call in a hospital that was one of the biggest tornadoes in u.S. History. Everybody did well inside your hospital. How are you feeling about that today? 
>> I don't think it's hit me, really. I still don't feel like I can take any credit for that. Like I said, I was just doing my job and knew what I had to do. I can't imagine. It's very emotional. Everybody did get out. 
>> Sanjay, it's incredible. She's so humble, so many seemed so humble who did such amazing things. 
>> Yeah, I mean, you know, she was reluctant to take credit there, as you could tell, erin. By the way, she's 34 years old. And I expected this hardened trauma surgeon when I heard about the person who had e essentially coordinated this effort there in the hospital. But she took charge. She took people to the center part of the hospital, which is what you're supposed to do. She was trying to prevent people from getting head injuries. And as a result, and other doctors pointed this out to you, that the staff and the patients, nobody had a scratch on them. It could have gone in a much worse direction there. 
[00:24:40]



>> And sanjay, it brings me to these things that are just so incredible that happened. It was just one example. That a whole hospital, a whole floor was torn off and everyone is okay. Of course, there were lives lost. But not nearly as initially reported. The coroner's office yesterday said it could have been as much as 100 people and now it's only 24. What do you make about that dramatically changing number? 
>> I've seen this once before and I can tell you, the medical examiner's office is taken charge. 
>> What can happen sometimes is you might have two different organizations, the medical examiner. And, as a result, there may be a lack of communication and, as a result, a double counting. This was almost double the number. I think tchsz that double county again. It's an error. All right, dr. Sanjay gupta, thank you very much. This time, that number was dramatically number. 
>>> When the tornado touched down, there were a number of teachers who risked their lives. One of them clears their story next. And the image that has captured the hearts of so many around the world. The special relationship, the friendship between this man and this little boy. They're going to come "outfront" and talk about it next. people question: How old is the oldest person you've known? We gave people a sticker and had them show us. We learned a lot of us have known someone who's lived well into their 90s. And that's a great thing. But even though we're living longer, one thing that hasn't changed much is the official retirement age. ??? ??? the question is how do you make sure you have the money you need to enjoy all of these years. ??? ??? to go.

[00:30:30]



>>> We start the second half of our show reporting from the front line. We are watching the irs story. She's going to invoke her right against self incrimination. Lewis learner has already admitted publically to cross-suit niehe group two tea party groups have filed lawsuits against the irs alleging privacy. Violations. We have new developments in iran. The body that candidates has approved 8 candidates to run for president. Absent from the list is the current president. He says that was a long thought any way. Consulting was this will likely be a more conservative player, closer to the supreme player. Now, the crucial first round of voting begins june 14 lt. A dramatic statement made to jurors today. Jodi arias spoke and pleaded that her life be spared. You may remember in an interview, after, she was found guilty, she said she wanted the death penalty. She's apparently saying something different. She called the murder of ex-boyfriend travis alex ander the worst mistake she'd ever made and says she could be constructive in prison. 
>> I can help other become literate so they can add that dimension to their lives. 
[00:32:37]



>> The ceo of apple, tim cook, defended the company's tax strategy on capitol hill. So there's a senate panel that says apple has been purposely avoiding billions of dollars in taxes by shifting income to overseas subsidiaries. Cook claims the strategy is legal. What apple does, as you know, given all of its success, is make money all over the world and keep it overseas. Nicholas thompson says it's done great things for our economy. It has been 656 ds since the united states lost its top credit rating. Stocks did end the day with a record high. The central bank would keep pumping money into the economy. Profits are at record highs, but wages are simply not keeping up. And back to our top story tonight, the disaster in oklahoma. It has been raining throughout the day on and off. Zern search and rescue made operations all day long. And according to glen lewis, at this point, he's saying they don't have anyone missing. Authorities are continuing their search to make sure that there are no survivors overlooked. 24 people have been confirmed as killed, including eight children and more. We've also just learned in the past hour that 2400 homes were damaged. And, as we speak, additional help is pouring into the region. The president spoke assurie ing federal aid is on its way. And that moment was at the briarwood elementary school. At briarwood, everyone survived. Teachers put their lives on the line to save every single child. 
[00:35:07]



>> Theesz are the frantic moments after the tornado struck briarwood elementary school in moore, oklahoma. Words can't fully do justice. 
>> I can't echbl describe what was going through my head. I was numb. 
>> This is what you saw? Yeah, right before we went in. 
>> She snapped this picture. Tammy raced inside and crammed about 20 students into a closet and bathroom. 
>> Before I shut the door, because those bathrooms have doors, I shut the doors and i said I love you. The boys looked at me a little bit strange. I walked into the girls and i said I love you. I just told them to pray. That's what we did the whole time in the closet was pray. 
>> Do you think they grasped what was about to happen? I'm not guilty really sure. We're about to have a program in two days. So they were practicing. I glanced up once and you could just see it. It was like brown. Huge. Never-ending. Just all the way up to the heavens. And then I got back down, a cinder block fell on my neck. They decided to move those students in there at that very last second. The walls started caving in. This car blown into the side of the wall. If there had been students on the other side, it could have been devastating. 
[00:37:41]



>> Despite what you see here, everyone at that school survived. The students were brave. 
>> I mean, they were calm. 
>> Why dooupg that is? As we talked, she braught a muddy paper. 
>> A beautiful handwriting award that a little boy named jackson was supposed to receive this week. Tammy glasgow won't allow them to take it away. >>Hat do you see right now? 
>> At home. I miss him. I know we just have three days left. I want to make sure they're all right. 
>> A lot of people we spoke with today are wondering whether or not more money should be invested in building storm shelters. What's interesting is a lot can be huddled into when tornadoes approach. 
>> Thanks very much to you. A big question going on about those shelters. Images of relief and gratitude, including this one. You may have seen it. The man hugging that little boy and that moment of reunion. The school no longer exists, but that little boy does. Here's what that little boy first saw in that familiar face. 
>>> Earlier, I spoke to the two people in that photo. And I asked them about that woman. 
[00:39:47]



>> I'm just sitting there. I was just relieved to fiengd hezika. I knew he was there after school. Just to see him and know that he was okay. And didn't have any cuts or bruises or anything. It was an emotional connection that we had. It was very real and very rewarding, very satisfying. 
>> What went through your mind? 
>> What went through your mind when you first saw me and you knew it was big dog. When I first saw you, I knew that you were going to pick me up so I just jumped. I was happy that I survived. 
>> When you hear hezakaya say that, how do you feel? You were that light for him? 
>> Yeah, I felt like maybe i nooded that hug as much as he did at that time. It was just so much chaos. It was so chaotic. And we just weren't sure, you know, that the school was pretty much devastated and mostly destroyed. And we just weren't sure if anyone was going to come out alive. It was awesome. 
[00:41:58]



>> What did you think at that moment? 
>> I just 
-- I saw him when i came 
-- I came around the corner. I saw that the school was gone and I just took off running. I said he's in there and I need to find him. He screamed my name it was the best feeling ever to know that he was safe and alive. 
>> I just want to ask, how does he feel now? Does he want to go back to school? Or not? 
>> How do you feel now? Do you want to go back to that school or not? 
>> I don't really want to go back to the school. Unless there's another one. If there's another one, I just want to, like, stay away from it and go to a different school so I don't have to go through it again. And you were very close to hezakaya, what does that do for you? 
>> Well, he's a special little man. And I think this will just 
-- this will enrich our relationship, as far as that goings. S. He's just continue to be the same little dog. He calls me big dog and I call him little dog. He just says I'm so glad to see you, big dog, whenever he ran through me. So it was pretty special. 
>> Does it surprise you? I mean, the whole world has seen it. It has become an image of joy and recovery. Can you believe that? No,i can't. The media outlets that are getting these types of stories and pictures out for everyone that actually helps us, you know, to the heeling process and helps us to learn and see that we have to depend on one another. We have to depend on one another to get through these kinds of things. We're oklahomans and that's the oklahoma spirit. We've been through this. We'll get through it. By the grace of god, we'll rebuild and clean up and move on. Thank you so much. All right, thanks to all three of you. Okay, thank you. 
[00:44:45]



>> Next, more than one hundred people have been pulled alive from the path of discussion. Many of them safed by rescue dogs. We're going to meet the handler and the dog live "outfront" next. To more efficient pick-ups. ??? ??? wireless is limitless. ] ??? ???

Dan, I know when you reached the scene, it was just 15 minutes after touchdown. Where did you go first to look for people? 
[00:49:08]



>> We were assigned to search briarwood elementary. 
>> And briarwood was completely levelled? 
>> You must have gotten there and thought the devastation was incredible, yet, you were able to get everyone out alive? 
>> Yeah, it was a true amount of devastation. Dana, I know you're there with salsa who is looking so calm and in control, you've been working, though, canine teams on the ground, 12 hour shifts, just completely exhausting. Human or dog. How were you able to find people? How does salsa work? 
>> The handler's main responsibility is to make sure they cover the area. 
>> She's traind, when she gets the scent of a live human, she'll put her nose down and just bark until we relieve them. 
>> When you're in the middle of this, you haven't slept, you get word that your niece was among the missing in briarwood. What happened to her? 
>> She was, actually, picked up by her grandparents. Her father, when we first dispatched, we had to park several blocks away. One of the citizens grabbed me on the arm and said can you help me? He needed to find her. So it became not just a normal search, but a more personal, going through briarwood elementary, searching for her. But, thankfully, she was picked up earlier. So it turned out well. 
[00:51:32]



>> That was a blessing. And, you know, salsa has worked in five other tornadoes, when she finds someone alive and you hear her bark, does she feel a sense of a pride? Does she know and understand the amazing thing she's just done? Do you think? 
>> No they actually 
-- during our trainings, it's no different to them. To them, they're playing another game of hide and seek. So the victim that we're searching for, to them, is somebody that's hiding. So they're the least stressed out on this search.

>>> When the tornado touched down on monday, it caught a lot of people off guard. Mostly, because there's been a real lull in tornadoes they say you think usually cool conditions cut tornado activity by depriving moist, warm air that they need to feel tornadoes. But, yet, even with fewer storms, america still has the bulk of the world's tornado activity. It brings me to tonight's number. 75%. That's the percent of tornadoes that occur in this country every year. The u.S. Averages between 800 and a thousand tornadoes. Ja pan is the second country on that list and they only get 100. But why? It's a combination of a couple things. Tornado alley really cuts right through the midwest. It's a climate that creates tornadoes. When you think about it, is that probable, why is there such a discrepancy in the numbers. 75% in this country. I've been doing a lot of places around the world that seem similar. It shows you how amazing it is, how little we still can understand. Our continuing coverage of the devastating coverage continues with piers morgan live after this break. Ere.

>> Now to your "fox 29" weather authority forecast. A live look at atlantic city on what seems to be kind of a hot summer like day. Looks a little hazy out there. A lot of people will be headed down to the shore this weekend for memorial day weekend. Of course, the unofficial start to summer. 
>> Chief meteorologist scott will jumps joining us again. Of course, everyone is asking about the hospital day weekend. How will it shape up. 
>> Thomas and kerry, it looks like it's goss to be noticeably cooler because a part of the same system that brought all the severe system across the heartland will head in our direction. But behind it we're looking at some cooler conditions for the memorial day weekend. I want to take you back to yesterday. Take a look at ultimate doppler just south of moore, oklahoma. Do you note that hook it kind of looks like a thumb? That is where the actual tornado started. It continued on the ground for about 17 miles and national weather service officials out of norman, oklahoma, have been out surveying the damage all day long. Rating it now asan ef5 tornado with peak winds over 200 miles per hour. The width, 1.3 miles and once again it traveled on the ground for 17 miles for 50 minutes. So impressive there. The track of yesterday's tornado was similar to the same location back in may third of 1999. So, of course, double whammy there for moore, oklahoma. As we look at ultimate doppler closer to home, we are quiet but look at the showers and thunderstorms erupting toward upstate new york as well as sections of new england. That activity will likely stay to our north. But I am tracking severe thunderstorm warnings near hartford connecticut as i expand the view take a look at the system. Warm and humid out ahead of it. Those winds out of the southwest pumping in that moisture. It's very muggy today. As we move behind that system you can see that cooler air n will arrive in our neck of the woods by the up coming weekend. 82 degrees was the high temperature today and it's still warm. Eighty-two is the current temperature look at that humidity at 56%. Temperatures area wide in the low to mid 80s. Upper 70s once you head down the shore. As we go hour by hour threw this evening staying dry. It will be muggy and we will see patchy fog developing again tonight. And continuing tomorrow morning. Tomorrow during the day, scattered showers and thunderstorms developing, but the bulk of the rainfall will arrive with that system which is right now in the midwest during the day thursday. On and off again showers. There could be some thunderstorms during the afternoon. So some heavy rain, some gusty winds, not out of the question, of course, we'll monitor that situation as far as our potential force for your weather. Right now it looks like it will be on the low side t night in the 60s. 86 degrees for the high temperature tomorrow. Warm and muggy. Forecast by the numbers, for tomorrow, we will give it an eight. As we look at that weather authority seven day forecast, friday we'll keep clouds around. Some showers. Gradual clearing. A little cooler, 72 degrees but this weekend temperatures only in the upper 60s to near 70 degrees. So it is going to be cool for memorial day weekend, but it will be dry and the humidity levels will be down because right now it's really a summer preview stepping outside. 
[00:20:33]



>> It's muggy. 
>> Look at the positive. No rain. 
>> Yes. 
>> Here we go. 69 degrees. Thanks a lot, scott. 
>> It's muggy. 
>> It is. 
>> I got 
-- 
>> words of wisdom or something. 
>> You can tell by your hair. 
>> That's right. 
>> I'm talking about howard's. 
>> His always looks the same. 
>> U.S. Ga changed another rule in golf which shows us they have too time on their hands. And the sixers watch the nba draft. One of those top three picks. I'll run it down how remote it will be coming up in sports. ????????????. 
[00:25:02]



>> The phillies will have ryan howard back in the lineup tonight. But with or without the offense struggles much the phillies have 23 games where they have scored three or less runs. But last night one run against two and six pitcher against horrible team, well, that drives all of us just crazy. Phillies were zero-five with runners in scoring position last night. That's not good. Revert flys out. Dell mon young is out. Jimmy rollins. All with runners in scoring bigs. Phillies radio broadcaster larry anderson on 94 wip last night showed his frustration. 
>> Four of their 13 wins against the phils, 13 wins is what they'll have, and I mean, I'm sorry, but you got to be a little embarrassed. 
>> Well you would hope so. The 76ers will get an idea about some of their future tonight when the nba holds the draft lottery. That lays out the drafting order of the 14 teams that did not make the playoffs. Sixers are one of those. They had the 11th worst recordand not a great chance now of getting one of the top three picks. The percentage of their ping-pong ball coming up for the first pink is zero-point 8%. The sixers have a zero-point 9% getting the second pick. Getting the third one point 2% and the odds of getting the first pick 124-one. Kerry has a better chance of making ten straight foul shots. 
>> United states golf association has too much time on their hands. Another rule change today clearly not necessary. Starting in 2016 the use of any putter that is anchored to the body, any part of the body, will be illegal. That's now rule 14-1b. The usga says it protects one of the most important challenges of the game, the free swing of the entire golf club. Will it comes down to it tiger woods not liking it and losing the master's to adam scott who won the masters with tigers old caddy and used the long putter is a bigger reason than anything else. That's my opinion and I'm standing by it. 
>> Yeah. 
>> My final answer. 
>> There you go. 
>> That does it for us here at 6:00. 
[00:27:02]



>> Have great night. We'll see you back here at 10:00. Inside edition coming up next. Be safe. 
>> See ya. ????????????

>> It real s it feels almost tropical stepping outdoors and we'll be stuck in this pea soup over the neck several days and also we'll have to contend with showers and thunderstorms. Taking a look back yesterday. Look at this visible satellite. You can see the explosion of showers and thunderstorms developing around moore, oklahoma. Those super cells produced tornadoes, devastating winds, lightning and hail. You can see those over shooting tops coming off the top of those clouds as we look from space. This is the activity yesterday in the heartland. Survey crews were out assessing the damage. Peak winds over 200 miles an hour. Making it officially an ef5 tornado. It traveled for 17 miles on the ground and its duration was 50 minutes. So almost on the ground for an hour just unbelievable. We are quiet right now around the philadelphia area, but take a look as we move toward unstate new york, sections of new england looking at severe weather right now. Rolling through the state of connecticut as well as rhode island tracking a couple of tornado warnings and severe thunderstorm warnings there. That activity will stay to our north. We'll be watching the activity moving in from the west out of the out ahead of this system, it's warm, very trap. Behind the system we're looking at cooler air. It's the clash, the battle of the air mass that is created the severe weather through sections of oklahoma on yesterday and all of that activity will slowly but surely make its way toward our area. High temperature today's well above the normal which is 75 degrees. Eighty-two was the high. And we still are checking in at 82 degrees. Those winds out of the southwest. Humidity close to 60%. So it is muggy stepping outdoors. Allentown 86 degrees right now. It's 85 in presidenting. Eighty-two in philadelphia. A little cooler because of the sea breeze down the shore. As we go hour by hour, fairly quiet. Those showers and thunderstorms should stay to our north. However, by tomorrow morning, we're looking at some patchy fog yet again with all of the moisture. By tomorrow, a few spotty showers during the heat of the day, and then I think the bulk of the activity arrives with that front during the day on thursday. So thursday looks to be the wettest day of the week with showers and thunderstorms. Some of those storms could produce some gusty winds. We'll watch for that, but otherwise that system will be weakening as it heads in our direction. So you can see thursday, look at the clock. This is 10:00 p.M. Looking at a good coverage of showers and thunderstorms. Temperatures tonight in the suburbs right around 63 degrees. Upper 60s in the city. Mild and muggy and once again we'll be watching out for some of that patchy fog. Warm and muggy tomorrow 86 degrees for the high. So we'll tack on about 4 degrees from today's high for wednesday. Forecast bite numbers on a scale of one to ten, we'll give it an eight. As we take into the rest of the week, you can see thursday showers and storms. Gradual clearing on friday. And turning cooler 72 for the high on friday but look at the upcoming saturday, sunday weekend time frame. Temperatures only in the upper 60s to right around 70 much that's inland so down the shore it will probably be in the low 60s. So it will be a cool memorial day weekend, but it will be dry and that humidity will certainly be lower than it is right now. 
[00:52:00]



>> It won't be terrible. The 60 did stand out, 69 a little bit. 
>> That's cool. About 15 degrees below for this time of year. 
>> We're ready to get on that summer 
-- y. I've been ready. 
>> I know. You know that, right? 
>> I know. 
>> This week I missed my golf game. 
>> Who would believe cole hamels is one and seven right now. 
>> Lost more games now than did he all last year. That's why he didn't talk to the media last night. It's unbelievable. The phillies will try again tonight to win a game against the miami marlins. The phillies have lost three straight. How hard is that to believe to this team and miami is awful. I know the fans are frustrated. Maybe no more than cole hamels who was so upset that the phillies are not scoring runs for him he left the clubhouse without talking to the medial that's not like cole hamels. Not a little bit. Zero-tie five with runners in scoring position. First and third in the seventh inning less than two outs and lance nix, that's a fly ball there won't be good enough, gang. That's not going to score the run. Phillies down two runs in the seventh and that will not score the run. All right. Now jimmy rollins first pitch, good job, jimmy. Ground ball to second base. The phillies 
-- it was again a lack of key hits by the phillies. If you want honesty listen to the radio guy scott franzke and larry andersen at the end of the broadcast you could tell andersen was angry and honest. 
>> That's now 25 games the phils have scored three or fewer runs. And that's 
-- I don't know how else to say the. That's just 
-- it's not one of those things you go, well, it will get better. I don't see it. It hasn't been good and i don't see it guessing getting better. Guys coming in and shutting them down. I got to tell you something this offense needs a little work. 
>> He wears his heart on his sleeve. Camp kelly for the eagles something the players really like. The plays are quick but most cases ease city understand. The plays are sent in to the offense with hand signals and the quarterback gets them over the radio in his helmet. The players are picking it up and they really seem to be comfortable. It's different but it really comes do to football. 
[00:54:06]



>> In some ways it's simpler but in some ways it's harder. Our verbiage when we were with coach reid was very long. Here it's a lot shorter. It's just that if it's going to be shorter everything has concepts and there's a whole lot of different concepts rather than having a word for each individual person. So from that part it's harder because you have to learn different concepts and how all the plays work and, you know, knowing where you are on the field. 
>> The 76ers will get an idea about some of their future tonight when the nba holds draft lottery laying out the draft order the 14 teams that did not make the playoffs. Sixers had the 11th worst record and not a great chance of getting one every the top three picks. The percentage of their ping-pong balls coming up for the first pick is zero-point 8%. The sixers have a zero-point 9% getting the second pick. Getting the third pick is one point 2%. And the odds of getting the first pick 124-one. Kerry has a better chance of naming the top five starters of the la clippers. 
>> Not going to happen. 
>> No. Now to chelsea england. This is a ceremony for a dedication for a retirement. But one of the players son's at this soccer game decided to take over the crowd. And the ceremony had to stop, the little guy just 
-- the little guy scores the goal. 
>> That's awesome. 
>> Wait a minute. He's not done. He plays it down. 
>> How old is he he can't be more than three. 
>> My gosh. 
>> Intellectually live any way. Thank you. 
>> Thomas drayton here with a look what's ahead at 6:00. 
>> Good evening. Tonight we continue to follow the sr. Fifty two advisors in oklahoma after monstrous tornado tour through the state. Coming up next at 6:00 stories of devastation and survival. We'll let you know how you can help the residents of moore, oklahoma. 
>> And closer to home, some hurricane sandy victims still dealing with damage from the super storm receive an offer from the government to help them move on. ???????????? 
[00:59:44]



>> live from center city in philadelphia this is "fox 29 news" at 6:00. ???????????? 
>> right now at 6:00, devastation in the nation's heartland.

>> More than four years later... 
>> No one going to jail, no individual is being held accountable. This is totally about what went on on Wall Street. 
>> Frontline investigates why no Wall Street executives have gone to jail. 
>> The FBI wasn't aiming high enough. 
>> There was a definite sense that Justice backed off. 
>> Did the government fail? 
>> MARTIN SMITH: A number of people told us that you didn't make this a top priority. 
>> Well, I'm sorry if they think that, because I made it an incredibly top priority. 
>> So you're telling me that not one executive on Wall Street committed provable fraud? I mean, I just don't believe that.

[00:02:07]



>> Although this downturn started in the housing sector and in the financial sector, you're seeing a lot of things being hit. 
>> Today's numbers suggest job losses are accelerating. 
>> That's the biggest loss since 1974. The unemployment rate... 
>> NARRATOR: In 2009, Wall Street bankers were on the defensive. The great American mortgage bubble had burst. 
>> This is a huge amount of money. 
>> NARRATOR: The economy was in ruins and Wall Street bankers were being blamed. Bankers admitted they had miscalculated. But they were also worried that they could be he criminally liable for fraud. 
>> He and President Obama will continue to work on... 
>> NARRATOR: With a new administration arriving in Washington, bankers and their attorneys expected investigations and at least some prosecutions. 
>> ...$150 billion in mortgage-backed securities. 
>> SMITH: Was there a sense that there were going to be prosecutions of alleged fraud related to the mortgage crisis? 
>> I think there was that expectation. I think people had seen the financial crisis. There was obviously a lot of conduct that had gone on that was improper. And I think people were expecting to see some substantial prosecutions. 
>> The men and women who duped would-be homeowners, who defrauded the American investor, need to be identified, prosecuted, convicted and thrown in jail. 
>> NARRATOR: In Washington, there was broad support for prosecuting Wall Street. 
>> I was really upset about what went on on Wall Street that brought about the financial crisis. Not only destroyed the finance... almost destroyed the financial system of the United States, almost destroyed the financial system of the world. That doesn't happen if there isn't something bad going on. 
>> NARRATOR: But today, more than four years since the financial crisis of 2008, there have been no arrests of any senior Wall Street executives. Chief of the Criminal Division at Justice, Lanny Breuer, says the problem is that greed is not necessarily criminal. 
[00:04:14]



>> I am personally offended by much of what I have seen. I think there was a level of greed, a level of excessive risk taking in this situation that I find abominable and I find very upsetting. But that is not what makes a criminal case. What makes a criminal case is that I can prove beyond a reasonable doubt every element of a crime. 
>> NARRATOR: Some former prosecutors believe the problem is a lack of effort. 
>> The Justice Department failed. They have not done what needed to be done. They didn't ever try to bring together one coherent narrative, laying out the entirety of the story, against one of the major players and dend sanctions that are meaningful. That to me is what has been fundamentally lacking. 
>> NARRATOR: The story of how the big banks amassed enormous fortunes packaging home loans into securities and selling them to investors all over the world began, of course, on the ground with mortgage originators. 
>> What my Econ I prof taught us was business goes in cycles. My name is Michael Winston. I worked for Countrywide Financial Corporation from 2005 till 2008. They said their goal was world-class. Goldman Sachs on the Pacific. And they wanted me to realize their vision. See now if you can reach up, with both fists... 
>> NARRATOR: Michael Winston once lived inside the bubble at mortgage originator Countrywide. At first, Winston was impressed by CEO Angelo Mozilo and how he had turned Countrywide into America's number one mortgage company. 
>> How ya doin'? 
>> NARRATOR: But just a few months into the job, Winston had an encounter in the company parking lot. 
>> I'd been there five months when I happened to park next to a car with personalized vanity plates. And the personalized plates said, "Fund 'Em." And I had a conversation with the person nearest the car. I didn't know if it was the owner or just some guy walking by. And I just said, "'Fund 'Em,' that's an interesting plate. What do you suppose that means?" And he said, "That's Angelo Mozilo's growth strategy for 2006." And he said, "We have a loan for every customer." 
[00:06:41]



>> A growing family with a lot of debt. 
>> And I said, "A loan for every customer? How can that be?" 
>> A business owner whose income was hard to document. 
>> "What if the person doesn't have a job?" "Fund 'em," the guy said. I said, "What if he has no income?" "Fund 'em." "What if he has no assets?" And he said, "Fund 'em." 
>> Every one of them was turned down for a home loan by three different lenders. I'm with Countrywide, and I got them all approved. 
>> I said, "I'm confused. What are the standards you use, the criteria against which you make lending decisions?" And the guy looked at me, smiled smugly and said, "If they can fog a mirror, we'll give 'em a loan." 
>> My name is Christopher Cruise. I was a trainer of mortgage loan originators throughout the country. There was a Plano, Texas office in Countrywide, and people would sidle up to me, saying, "You wouldn't believe what's happening around here. You wouldn't believe the loans I've been getting approved here." They were just flabbergasted at what would... what was going through the pipeline. 
>> These are still on the books. Did you know that? 
>> NARRATOR: Christopher Cruise describes an industry driven to loosen its standards by demand from New York. 
>> You got the sense that Wall Street was in control of underwriting standards and not the mortgage industry. 
>> SMITH: What do you mean? 
>> Well, if the underwriting was acceptable to Wall Street, if the underwriting was acceptable to the ratings agencies, that's all that counted. And so my sense is, it was probably a game among the people in the mortgage business to say, "Let's come up with one of the worst loans we could possibly imagine and see if Wall Street will buy it." 
>> New homes are selling at the second highest rate on record. 
>> And then that type of mentality translates into, "Don't worry about whether the documents are valid. Don't worry about whether we can verify income. Don't worry if the appraisal is any good. Just worry about getting the damn loan closed. Because if you can get that closed, we can get that securitized and then turn around and do another loan. Don't worry about it. There's too much money out there. Just get the loan closed." 
[00:08:51]



>> ...about $36 billion in bonuses this year. 
>> This is totally about what went on on Wall Street. Was, in fact, Wall Street going out into California and saying, "Hey, just put the mortgages together. Don't worry whether they're good or not. You get a fee, I'll take 'em, I'll bundle 'em up, I'll sell 'em off to somebody else, I'll make my money on that. And whatever happens to the mortgages doesn't really matter." 
>> NARRATOR: Even during the bubble years, the Department of Justice had arrested and prosecuted many small mortgage brokers, loan appraisers and even homebuyers. But to go after Wall Street bankers would prove to be much harder. 
>> SMITH: The Justice Department has indicted something like 2,000 to 3,000 people that were making the lns, the loan originators. 
>> Right. Shootin' fish in a barrel, that's what that is. 
>> SMITH: No bankers have gone to jail. Does that surprise you? 
>> No. It doesn't surprise me. 
>> NARRATOR: To prosecute Wall Street, investigators needed to find proof of what the bankers knew and what they intended. This meant identifying people on the inside who were willing to talk. 
>> I have always believed u start at the bottom up in a bank, you start at the credit department. Go to the credit department. Find out what the credit department knew. Those are the guys who wear green eyeshades, who don't get the big bonuses, who want to make sure that the loans, the underwritings are legitimate. They actually crunch the numbers. They're the ones who send the memos up to the folks who get the big bucks. How the folks at the top react to those memos is what determines whether the bank acts properly. 
>> NARRATOR: At the big investment banks, the credit departments hired contractors known as due diligence underwriters. 
>> My name is Tom Leonard. I was a due diligence underwriter. 
>> My name is Eileen Loiacono and I was a contract underwriter. 
[00:10:52]



>> My name is Chico Morton and I was a due diligence underwriter. 
>> SMITH: What does a due diligence underwriter do? 
>> A due diligence underwriter assesses the risk of buying loan portfolios. So a company on Wall Street, they're going to buy a loan pool, or a portfolio of loans, and we would be hired to go in and take a sample of the loans and review them. 
>> SMITH: So you were contract workers? 
>> Yes. 
>> SMITH: And then what would you do? How would you go about doing the due diligence? 
>> Well, we would travel to the location where the loans were stored. And we'd have a room, either a hotel room, conference room, or some workroom where we could set up tables and our laptop computers. 
>> SMITH: So these loans would come in in banker's boxes? 
>> Yes. A lot of times, we were doing the manual labor of... of moving the boxes of loans back and forth. Load all these boxes on vans and drive 'em to the hotel. Unload 'em at the hotel, into the room where the due diligence underwriters were working. And there could be stacks all the way up to the ceiling. And there could be anywhere from ten to 20 separate mortgages within each banker's box. 
>> 30 underwriters crammed at a table, you know, bumpin' shoulders. And, you know, sometimes we're in there at 6:30, sometimes we're out at 10:00, 11:00, 12:00 at night. I've been on jobs where we... we worked late. 
>> SMITH: And so, what was it like? What was the atmosphere like? 
>> Um... it was like a party. You know, we were all in hotels together, so, you know, it was definitely a party atmosphere. We were getting through those loans as quick as we can. They were not being looked at like they should have been looked at. 
>> It wasn't uncommon to have an underwriter on one side of the room start to laugh and say, you know, "Hey, get a load of this. You know, here's a guy that's moving from $500 a month in rent to a $650,000 house, and he's an electrician and his wife is a waitress." 
[00:13:10]


(imitates laughter) Everybody in the room laughing. Somebody else would have another story. 
>> School teacher making, you know, $10,000 a month. Or a waitress makin', you know, $12,000 a month. You're supposed to exercise some common sense and, you know, like, say, "Okay, well, is it reasonable that they could make XYZ a month?" But a lot of times, we didn't do that. 
>> SMITH: You didn't do that, on the instruction of your supervisor, your lead? 
>> Right. 
>> SMITH: So the lead would say what? 
>> Um... (laughing) "Looks reasonable to me." 
>> SMITH: So he would say, "That waitress making $12,000 a month looks reasonable to me"? 
>> Yeah. 
>> SMITH: You're kidding. 
>> Well, dependin' on the area. You know, if it's... 
>> SMITH: What area does a waitress make $12,000 a month? 
>> Las Vegas. You know, if it's Vegas, then, you know, possibly with tips and all that stuff, or... 
>> SMITH: I can't do the math, but that sounds pretty high. 
>> Right. It is high. 
>> You couldn't say the word "fraud" because we couldn't prove that it was fraud. 
>> SMITH: Well, if you saw something that was a misrepresentation, you were expressly told, "Don't write 'fraud' or mention... use the word 'fraud'?" 
>> All the time. Even if we suspected, we had to say, "This appears to be incorrect." You would never say, "This looks fraudulent." 
>> SMITH: Were you told to ignore loans that you clearly knew contained fraud? 
>> Um... Well, fraud, in the due diligence world, fraud was the F-word, or the F-bomb. You didn't use that word. 
[00:15:12]



>> SMITH: Even if a loan was clearly, you know, a stated income loan that made no sense, there was no support for... 
>> Yeah, but you didn't use the word "fraud" when you... 
>> SMITH: But it was fraud. You saw loans that... 
>> By your terms and my terms, yes, it was fraud. By the due diligence terms, it was something else. 
>> NARRATOR: And it wasn't just outside contract underwriters who were finding fraud. Insiders at the big banks were finding problems. 
>> My name is Richard Bowen. I was with Citigroup and I was a senior vice-president and business chief underwriter in the commercial lending group. And the overall operations I had purview over involved about $90 billion a year of mortgages we were purchasing from other mortgage companies. 
>> SMITH: And what were you to do with those $90 billion worth of mortgages? 
>> I had responsibility to make sure that those mortgages met our credit policy guidelines. 
>> SMITH: So the bank had agreed to buy these loans. 
>> Subject to their meeting our credit policy. 
>> SMITH: But you found out that the loans that you... your team was looking at didn't meet the credit policy? 
>> We found that approximately 60% of the loans did not meet our policy. 
>> Smith:60%? 
>> 60%, yes. 
>> SMITH: 60% of the loans didn't meet the... 
>> Our policy, yes. And the volumes increased through 2007, and the rate of defective mortgages increased from 60% to in excess of 80%. 
>> NARRATOR: On November 3, 2007, Bowen wrote an e-mail to four senior Citibank executives including board chairman and former Secretary of the Treasury Robert Rubin. "Since mid-2006, I have continually identified breakdowns in internal controls. I must now communicate these concerns... I am deeply distressed." 
[00:17:19]



>> I actually included in that e-mail my cell phone, told them I was available this weekend, to please call me. And in that e-mail, I also requested an outside investigation. And in December, I sent another e-mail and I said, "Please contact me. You need to know the details behind this. There are risks to the company." 
>> Just a few months ago, they were giants, but now they need rescue. 
>> NARRATOR: There were risks to the entire country. By 2008, highly-leveraged banks stuffed with bad loans began to fail. 
>> The Federal Reserve is bailing out Bear Stearns. 
>> That business is gone. 
>> SMITH: What did you think when Bear Stearns went down? 
>> I couldn't believe it. Like, I thought the whole banking system was about to go down. 
>> NARRATOR: It almost did. Billions drained from the economy overnight. The party was over. 
>> ...in July and said everything was great, and off that a lot of people bought stock... 
>> Bill O'Reilly was having a temper tantrum on his show where he was going off about, you know, "Why didn't I hear about this? Why didn't somebody tell me about all this that was going on?" 
>> This industry... 90%... millions of dollars. 
>> And I almost threw my shoe through the television set. 
>> We just heard the words, look, stop the BS here. 
>> And I was screaming and yelling, "I did try to let you know!" 'Cause he had been one of the ones that I had sent e-mails and never received any response. 
>> Millions of American taxpayers are still wondering, how did we get ourselves into this economic mess, and is there someone truly to blame? 
>> Hello, everybody. 
>> NARRATOR: To help prosecute those who were to blame, President Obama signed a new bill. 
>> Four months ago today, we took office amidst unprecedented economic turmoil. 
[00:19:22]



>> NARRATOR: It was designed to amend America's fraud statutes. 
>> ...sign the Fraud Enforcement and Recovery Act... 
>> NARRATOR: To make prosecution easier and also to increase funding for the SEC, the FBI and the Department of Justice. (applause) 
>> Senator Ted Kaufman is a Democrat from Delaware, the man who now holds the seat vacated by Vice President Joe Biden. 
>> NARRATOR: Senator Ted Kaufman was a co-sponsor of the bill. He was an unusual senator. 
>> When this particular term is up, what are you going to do? 
>> Oh, I am going to leave. I would never run for office. 
>> NARRATOR: Appointed to replace Senator Joe Biden, he had taken no campaign money and was beholden to no lobbyists. 
>> I want to see people who have committed such fraud and the havoc it's caused this country... frankly, I want to see them go to jail. 
>> NARRATOR: In early 2009, Kaufman joined his colleagues on the Senate Judiciary Committee to discuss bolstering the FBI and Justice Department's financial crimes units. 
>> I'm going to ask some questions to each of you. 
>> My feeling and Senator Leahy's feeling is that, you know, if you're going to stop crime, the best way is to punish crime, and the best way to do that is to put people in jail. 
>> Senator Kaufman. 
>> NARRATOR: Senators were surprised by how unprepared the government was to investigate Wall Street. 
>> The deputy director of the FBI gave incredible testimony. 
>> After 9/11, we moved almost 2,000 criminal investigative resources over to national security matters. 
>> He said what happened was the government had transferred a great deal of the FBI agents over to anti-terrorism. But they didn't replace them. So we're basically down to 200 FBI agents. 
>> We have about 240 agents... 
>> And what he said was essentially during the savings d loan crisis, there were 1,000 FBI agents working on fraud. 
>> Charles Keating, millionaire banker who was... 
>> NARRATOR: After the S&L crisis of the '80s, the government responded forcefully. Back then, Justice convicted over 1,000 bankers, a third of them top executives. 
>> ...who was led off in handcuffs today. You've introduced a bill that you believe... 
[00:21:27]



>> NARRATOR: In the wake of the financial crisis of 2008, Kaufman wanted the government to respond as it had in the past. 
>> We should find them, and if they're guilty of a crime, they should go to jail. 
>> Why should people hearing you have any confidence that there will be serious investigations and serious penalties to some of the biggest and most powerful people in corporate America? 
>> Trust me, it's going to happen. I talked to... 
>> NARRATOR: Kaufman became front man for the new fraud enforcement bill. 
>> Ted began giving speeches and writing op-eds about how important it was. You know, we came up with this sort of slogan that, you know, when people rob a bank they know they're going to go to jail. 
>> If somebody robs a store and they get caught, they go to jail. If somebody robs hundreds of millions of dollars, they should go to jail. 
>> When bankers rob people, they should know they're going to go to jail. 
>> Commit a big crime, go to jail for big time. These people should go to jail. 
>> Lots of people on Wall Street said, "What are you doing? You're trying to destroy the banks. There's no crime up here. We didn't commit any crimes. There's no reason to come up here and start talking about crimes. Plus, we're very, very fragile. And, you know, something could happen if, in fact, you start talking about crime." Which was just totally completely ridiculous. 
>> Do you believe you're being used as a scapegoat? 
>> NARRATOR: There was one case already in the pipeline. It had been started under the Bush administration and involved two Bear Stearns hedge fund managers charged with deceiving investors. It was seen as a test case. 
>> A-ha. Finally we're beginning to see the criminal cases that will evidence a determination by the Justice Department to bring to justice those individuals who misled the public, who misled investors. Who, knowing that an investment was bad, still said it's good. 
>> NARRATOR: At first, prosecutors were optimistic. 
>> The knee-jerk reaction when this case s brought was that since people were incensed about what was happening with the economy, it would be a simple type of prosecution. I think there was that general perception. 
>> And so they figured that they'd have an easy conviction. And, you know, I mean, I think they believed in what they were doing. I'm not going to say they were malevolent. But they were naive. 
[00:23:35]



>> NARRATOR: It wasn't the strongest case. 
>> The government says that the e-mails are direct evidence... 
>> NARRATOR: With no whistleblowers talking, prosecutors had to rely on the interpretation of a few e-mails. 18 Wall Street defense attorneys went to work. And after a three-week trial, the government failed to convince a jury that the hedge fund managers were guilty. 
>> Breaking news involving those hedge fund managers... 
>> SMITH: Were you surprised by the outcome of the Bear Stearns hedge fund managers case? 
>> I was a little surprised but I wasn't shocked. These are hard cases to win. 
>> SMITH: Was the Justice Department wrong to go after those two guys? 
>> No, I thought that that was a reasonable case for the government to bring. Now, the fact it's a reasonable case to bring doesn't mean you're always going to win. 
>> The acquittal in that case left many of us feeling a little empty. 
>> Got to put a big wrench in the government's prosecution scheme... 
>> There was a definite sense that Justice backed off and that they became timorous when it came to making the cases that would really have gone to the heart of what did happen in the crisis of '08. 
>> NARRATOR: Senator Kaufman was worried. He wanted to make sure that Justice wouldn't shy from the next opportunity, and that the money Congress had appropriated would not go to waste. 
>> Ted said to Chairman Leahy, "I would like to chair an oversight hearing to ensure that these funds arbeing spent effectively." 
>> We met with Lanny Breuer, who was the head of the Criminal Division. We met with Rob Khuzami, who was head of enforcement for the Sec. We met with a senior deputy in the FBI, Kevin Perkins. 
>> We sat down, and we sort of got down to business, and Ted said, "Chairman Leahy has asked me to hold an oversight hearing that will provide me with a public forum to explore, you know, just what you're doing on this front of investigating Wall Street." Well, that certainly got their attention. 
[00:25:37]



>> They started telling me about this great thing they had out in California, this web to catch the mortgage brokers who had given out the loans. And we made it clear to them, I made it clear to them, that absolutely positively I don't-- I'm not-- this is not about L.A. This is totally about what went on on Wall Street. That's what the bill says and that's what the emphasis is. 
>> We said, you know, "Don't just come back here a couple of years from now and say, you know, 'Look at all the small fry we nailed to the wall.' You know, we're talking about also investigating senior-level people at Wall Street firms, even at the board level." 
>> I think we might have been a little bit concerned at this meeting that the FBI wasn't necessarily at that point-- this is now fall of 2009-- aiming high enough. 
>> NARRATOR: Shortly before the hearing, the Justice Department made an announcement. 
>> President Obama has established the Financial Fraud Enforcement Task Force to investigate and to prosecute fraud and financial crime. 
>> This is the value of oversight hearings. A week before our hearing, they announce the fraud task force. 
>> And we will not hesitate to bring charges where appropriate for criminal misconduct. 
>> Somebody had to come to that hearing and talk about what they were doing. And so that was the impetus, I am convinced till the day I die, that the only reason that fraud task force was announced at that point was because somebody had to go to the hearing. 
>> Mr. Breuer, last month we saw a jury acquit the two Bear Stearns hedge fund managers. Are there lessons we can learn from that or was that just a one-off? 
>> I'm a big believer in the jury system and juries are going to do what juries feel are right. These are tough cases, but we are going to continue to bring them. 
>> Why haven't we seen more board room prosecutions? 
>> Senator, these are complicated cases. Don't for a moment think that they're not being pursued and investigated. 
>> From Main Street to Wall Street and beyond. 
>> We are focused on that, and we will bring the cases where we... where it's appropriate. 
>> SMITH: Isn't this a bit of theater? I mean, ey had the questions in advance. 
>> Well, I thought it was fair theater, because, you know, we were asking tough questions. 
>> If we come back a year from now, and we're having this hearing, how much progress do you think we'll have made? 
[00:27:42]



>> I do think it served a purpose. I mean, do I wish we had been even more aggressive? Yes. But we were willing to give them the benefit of the doubt. And we felt like, okay, let's sit back and let them do their jobs. 
>> Okay, you're going through this door on the left. 
>> NARRATOR: But over the next year, it would be others, not the Justice Department, who put bankers on the witness stand. 
>> We are audited and reviewed and subject and we have due diligence practices. 
>> Was your due diligence adequate? 
>> NARRATOR: Beginning in January 2010, a fact-finding commission established and funded by Kaufman's Fraud Enforcement and Recovery Act held a series of public hearings. 
>> In mortgage underwriting, somehow we just missed that home prices don't go up forever. 
>> We held 19 public hearings. We reviewed millions of pages of documents-- corporate documents, regulatory documents-- most of which had never seen the light of day. 
>> Mr. Bowen. 
>> Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I witnessed business risk practices which made a mockery of Citi credit policy. 
>> If you take an organization like Citigroup, for example-- people involved in due diligence like Richard Bowen signaled up the line all the way up to Robert Rubin that something was wrong, that they were finding that some 60% of mortgages they were buying weren't meeting their standards. Mr. Bowen sent you an e-mail. 
>> NARRATOR: In one exchange, the commission asked Citibank's Robert Rubin to respond to Bowen's e-mail. 
>> Did you ever act on that? 
>> Mr. Chairman, I do recollect this and that either I or somebody else-- and I truly do not remember who-- but either I or somebody else sent it to the appropriate people. 
>> NARRATOR: Rubin told Angelides that actions were taken to improve the bank's due diligence operations. But his recollections were vague. 
>> I certainly don't remember today whether I knew at the time or not. I truly don't. 
>> If the excuse at the top was, "We didn't know," that's a pretty poor excuse from people who are hauling down $10 million, $20 million, $30 million, or, in Robert Rubin's case, $115 million. 
[00:29:51]



>> NARRATOR: Bowen was demoted and eventually left the bank, but later, Citigroup admitted to wrongdoing in a civil fraud suit for failing to perform basic due diligence from 2004 to 2010. Another focus of the commission was the work of a due diligence company named Clayton Holdings. 
>> You know, one piece of information that we released were documents from Clayton Holdings-- who performed due diligence for two dozen banks-- who were buying mortgages from the Countrywides, the Ameriquests, the New Centurys, packaging those loans up and selling them to investors. And if you look at those documents, what they show is in each of these banks, Clayton Holdings was finding that a substantial portion of the loans did not meet the standards of the bank buying those loans. And bank after bank after bank, they took those loans, they knew they were defective, and notwithstanding that, they never told the investors. In fact, they told investors quite the opposite. So you look at that pattern of behavior and I think it raises very serious questions about whether this is criminal conduct. 
>> NARRATOR: This was among several referrals the commission made to the Justice Department for further investigation. We asked chief of the Criminal Division, Lanny Breuer, why such referrals hadn't led to charges. 
>> I can't really talk about any specific case. But Phil Angelides and I have had very direct and very good conversations. But in reality, in a criminal case, we have to prove beyond a reasonable doubt-- not a preponderance, not 51%, beyond any reasonable doubt-- that a crime was committed. If we cannot establish that, then we can't bring a criminal case. But we don't let these institutions go. We've brought civil cases. We've brought regulatory cases. And the entire approach here is to have a multipronged, comprehensive approach to what gave rise to the financial crisis. 
[00:31:57]



>> (chanting): Too big to fail, but not too big to go to jail! 
>> NARRATOR: In April 2010, Goldman Sachs CEO Lloyd Blankfein was summoned to the Hill by Senator Carl Levin. 
>> If Martha Stewart can go to jail, so can Blankfein! 
>> NARRATOR: This would be the biggest showdown between Congress and a major Wall Street banker. 
>> NARRATOR: Blankfein was unapologetic. 
>> Clients know our activities and they understand what market making is. 
>> Do you thing they know that you think something is a piece of crap when you sell it to them and then bet against it? You think they know that? 
>> The nature of the principal business and market making... 
>> Lloyd Blankfein argued it was perfectly okay, that at the same time we were selling securities to you, we were betting on the fact these securities were going to go down. "But that's okay 'cause we're a market-maker and we're allowed to do that." That sounds like fraud to me. In the first half of 2007, Goldman Sachs sold long-position CDOs to its clients, right? 
>> We sold... we reduced our risk. 
>> So you were selling CDOs at the same time you were taking short positions on the same CDOs? 
>> The best way of reducing your risk is to sell what you have. 
>> I believe in a free market, but if it's gonna be truly free, it cannot be designed for just a few people. It must be free of deception, it's got to be free of conflicts of interest, it needs a cop on the beat, and it's got to get back on Wall Street. We stand adjourned. 
>> NARRATOR: Senator Levin referred his committee's findings to Justice, but again, the department declined to bring any criminal charges. 
>> No one going to jail, no individuals being held accountable for anything other than relatively paltry fines. 
>> SMITH: The Justice Department says these are very difficult cases to bng. Showing intent and proving every step of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt is a difficult thing to do. 
>> I think that is without a doubt a factor in the difficulty of proving intent. But I'm sorry, I just don't believe there was enough effort. It just doesn't make common sense. And so you're telling me that not one banker, not one executive on Wall Street, not one player in this entire financial crisis committed provable fraud? I mean, I just don't believe that. 
[00:34:21]



>> NARRATOR: Kaufman and Connaughton were running out of patience. 
>> SMITH: I've talked to Senator Kaufman. I've talked to Senator Grassley. I've talked to staffers. I've talked to a number of people. They told us that they felt that you didn't make this a top priority. 
>> Well, I'm sorry if they think that, because I made it an incredibly top priority. But when we can't bring a case, we have a m... we have an ethical obligation not to bring those cases. But it's not for lack of trying. Our lawyers are working incredibly hard, and it's a disservice for anyone to suggest otherwise. 
>> SMITH: In all of this, was there a case that you thought could have gone forward as a criminal prosecution that didn't? 
>> You know, there were a lot of discussions along those lines. You know, I talked to Lanny when I was in the Criminal Division daily. 
>> SMITH: Did you argue with him? 
>> Yes. And we would argue this back and forth, and then we... but when we finally came to a decision, sometimes I would be frustrated. Sometimes I would be disappointed. 
>> SMITH: You always accepted the decision? 
>> But I accepted it. 
>> SMITH: As a professional, you accepted it. But did you accept it as a citizen? 
>> Well, that's... I mean, that's a bit different. Because as a citizen, I would hope that something would happen to them, somehow, some way. 
>> NARRATOR: Frontline spoke to two former high-level Justice Department prosecutors who served in the Criminal Division under Lanny Breuer. In their opinion, Breuer was overly fearful of losing. 
>> SMITH: We spoke to a couple of sources from within the Criminal Division. And they reported that when it came to Wall Street, there were no investigations going on. There were no subpoenas, no document reviews, no wiretaps. 
>> Well, I don't know who you spoke with because we have looked hard at the very types of matters th you're talking about. 
>> SMITH: These sources said that at the weekly indictment approval meetings that there was no case ever mentioned that was even close to indicting Wall Street for financial crimes. 
[00:36:26]



>> Well, Martin, have you looked at what we and the U.S. Attorney community did? I think you have to take a step back. Over the last couple of years, we have convicted Raj Rajaratnam. You'll say that's an insider trading case. But it's clearly going after Wall Street. 
>> SMITH: But it has nothing to do with the financial crisis, the meltdown, the packaging of bad mortgages that led to the collapse that led to the recession. 
>> Well, first of all, I think that the financial crisis, Martin, is multifaceted. And what we've had is a multipronged, multifaceted response. And it's simply a fiction to say that where crimes were committed, we didn't pursue the cases. And that's why where crimes were committed, you have more people in jail today for securities fraud, bank fraud and the like than ever before. 
>> SMITH: But no Wall Street executives? 
>> No Wall Street executives. 
>> NARRATOR: By September 2010, Senator Kaufman's term was nearing its end. Before leaving, he held a second oversight hearing. 
>> Criminals on Wall Street must be held to account. 
>> Ted decided he wanted to have a second hearing before he left office so that he could question Breuer, Perkins and Khuzami. 
>> We're now nearing the final quarter of 2010 without the sort of prosecutions that I fully expected we would hope to see by this time. 
>> SMITH: What was the thinking? I mean, if you can recount any conversations that you had with Senator Kaufman about, you know, "Let's pull these guys back into the room." 
>> From our perspective, it was a big mystery. You know, we really believed that there was sufficient evidence of fraud, that there should have been some cases. 
>> If heads don't roll, nobody makes any changes. I'm disappointed that in all of the wrongdoing that went on and all the fraud that went on, that there wasn't an effort to go after bigger fish than the evidence shows they went after. 
>> I think many times you have very sophisticated parties on both sides of these... 
>> Mr. Breuer basically kept his testimony at the level of generalities. 
>> You know, where the right balance is... 
[00:38:27]



>> And I was sitting there behind the senator, thinking, "You're dancing around the central question." Did the Department undertake a purposeful, concerted, timely investigation of higher-level Wall Street executives? 
>> For very complicated cases, there are lots of different issues... 
>> And at that point, I just began to feel like, okay, I feel like I'm being gamed here. 
>> They take time, they take the review of... 
>> Not only was no one going to be held to account for the financial crisis, but-- and I don't say this lightly-- no one was being held to account for the failure to hold Wall Street to account. I really think this was a stain on the American justice system. And I did not want to be an accomplice to that. So I packed my bags, sold my house, and left town the day Ted Kaufman's term was over. 
>> Banks stocks drove markets higher on Wall Street... >>I mean, I literally was driving down I-95 the day he left office. >>JP Morgan reported a 47% increase in income for the 4th quarter. Bank of America said they hope to raise dividends. 
>> NARRATOR: Meanwhile, a freelance journalist and blogger named Teri Buhl was sipping cocktails in Connecticut. 
>> I was actually at a fundraiser in Greenwich, and I met a man running for Congress. And he told me about a documentary filmmaker, Nick Verbitsky, who had been collecting a lot of interviews from Bear Stearns employees. 
>> So I go out and I find a borrower, and I lend this borrower $100,000... 
>> I actually had a friend who put me in touch with a couple of people who ended up in the film-- people that worked at EMC Mortgage, which is Bear's mortgage conduit, is really the factory floor of their entire mortgage operation. 
[00:40:29]



>> The problem with due diligence is it's very costly. 
>> We went through about three to four hours of multiple whistleblower tape detailing a massive fraud at the highest level inside of Bear Stearns against its own clients. 
>> NARRATOR: Buhl wrote a story for the Atlantic Monthly's website featuring two Bear Stearns insiders Verbitsky had interviewed. 
>> And the first call I got after that story came out was from a few lawyers that wanted to meet our whistleblowers. And they were representing a group of mortgage insurers called monolines. 
>> SMITH: What did they tell you? 
>> They told us that they were working on a massive fraud suit against Bear Stearns and that it's critical that our whistleblowers help build their case. 
>> NARRATOR: The lawyers worked at the New York firm Patterson Belknap, Webb & Tyler. They were suing Bear Stearns and its successor, JPMorgan Chase, on behalf of companies that had insured the quality of the loans Bear was selling. In January of 2011, they filed a 161-page complaint. 
>> And within 160 pages, that document essentially summed up what looks to be the core of the credit crisis. 
>> NARRATOR: Mark Palmer has pored through the Bear Stearns lawsuit and a dozen other private suits now pending against other Wall Street banks for fraudulently misrepresenting the mortgages they packaged and sold. 
>> SMITH: You say this is the core of the credit crisis. 
>> I believe so. Based on what we've seen thus far, frankly, I think there's some pretty decent evidence that the mortgage securitization industry was rotten to the core. 
>> SMITH: Do you think the government should have brought criminal cases against these players? 
>> I would find it difficult to believe that there wasn't sufficient evidence to at least indict many of the players involved here. 
>> NARRATOR: In building their cases, attorneys at Patterson Belknap spoke to over 35 whistleblowers, many of them due diligence supervisors and underwriters. Among them, Tom Leonard. 
[00:42:39]



>> SMITH: It was Patterson Belknap that first got in touch with you about this? 
>> Yes, yes. 
>> NARRATOR: Leonard told the lawyers how due diligence was compromised. 
>> SMITH: And you told the truth to them about what you had seen. 
>> Yes, sir. 
>> SMITH: And you were a supervisor? 
>> Yes. 
>> SMITH: d you saw what your... your underwriters were doing? 
>> Yes. 
>> SMITH: And you saw the instructions coming down from the banks? 
>> Yes. 
>> SMITH: What was the highest defect rate you ever saw on a job? 
>> Oh, gosh. We had a job that was, like, 50%. But then the word came down, everything got renegotiated and redone... 
>> SMITH: In other words, you would come into a job, you'd find 50% of the loans were defective, but then the standards would be loosened so that you could qualify those loans... 
>> Right. 
>> And mark them as not defective? 
>> Right. 
>> SMITH: Isn't that fraudulent? 
>> Yes. 
>> SMITH: Is this something you think is important for the government now to be prosecuting? The kind of fraud that you saw? 
>> Yeah. I mean, it's... if it's still within the statute of limitations. 
>> SMITH: The Department of Justice says that it'sery hard to prosecute these kinds of crimes, becae you have to prove criminal intent. 
>> Yes, sir. 
>> SMITH: How do you respond to that? 
>> I think if I was sitting on the jury and I saw this information, that I could pretty well assure myself that there'd beenriminal intent. 
>> SMITH: Were you ever contacted by anybody in law enforcement or the Justice Department? 
>> Not until just recently. 
>> We are going to step up on the principle of one set of rules for everyone, equal justice under law. 
>> NARRATOR: Finally, in late 2012, the State of New York sued a Wall Street bank for fraudulently misrepresenting the mortgages they packaged and sold. 
>> Very simply, we're investigating the misconduct of folks who caused the bubble... 
>> NARRATOR: The man who brought the suit was New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, co-chair of a new state-federal working group that included the Department of Justice, the SEC and others. 
[00:44:43]



>> ...complaint for securities fraud against JPMorgan Chase as successors to Bear Stearns and Company and EMC Mortgage Corporation. 
>> NARRATOR: Although the case centered on bankers' fraudulent and deceptive practices, no individuals were named. The suit was a civil, not criminal, case. 
>> SMITH: And you've alleged in the case of Bear Stearns that they passed these things on knowingly, intentionally, knowing they were bad? 
>> Yes. We think the facts, as alleged in our complaints, make it very hard to conclude that by 2006 and 2007 the folks at these banks did not know what was going on, and that they were putting more and more bad loans into these securities. 
>> SMITH: I guess I still don't understand. If this was so clear and so intentional and so many commissions and hearings brought this forward, why is this taking so long? 
>> You know, it's... it's hard for me to address the specifics of what happened before I got here. Believe me, we've moved as fast as we could. You have to ask others about what happened before then. 
>> SMITH: What gave you the confidence that you would have results, given that the government had gone for three years with, really, very little to show? 
>> We were able to do some work more quickly by subpoenaing the records of private parties that had brought actions. 
>> SMITH: You were drawn to the work of a private law firm, Patterson Belknap. 
>> Oh. 
>> SMITH: Erik Haas and his team of attorneys at Patterson Belknap. 
>> Well, we had... when we started our investigation, we took a look at what other complaints had been filed. And there were a whole series of private complaints that had been brought, and Patterson Belknap had brought a couple of those cases. 
>> SMITH: The complaint that was filed by New York Attorney General Schneiderman was based largely on work done by private law firms, work that goes back several years. What does that tell us about the work that the Justice Department was doing all this time? 
[00:46:45]



>> I do thin.. I think it's unusual for, but not unprecedented for, the Justice Department to sort of follow on to the work of private litigants. But it does raise the question, you know, why didn't the government develop it first? 
>> SMITH: That's a real question. 
>> It is. 
>> SMITH: Given all the pushing that you were doing and Senator Kaufman was doing. 
>> I think, yeah, I think it's an absolutely fair question to ask. 
>> NARRATOR: Attorney David Boies, whose firm has represented both banks and plaintiffs suing financial institutions, has also reviewed Schneiderman's complaint. 
>> SMITH: Schneiderman is bringing a civil case alleging fraud. 
>> Yes. 
>> SMITH: Couldn't it be filed as a criminal case? 
>> I think that if you took every allegation that's made in Schneiderman's complaint and you accepted that as true and believe that you could prove that beyond a reasonable doubt, that could've been filed as a criminal case. 
>> It was, like, $2.6 billion in one month... 
>> NARRATOR: Filmmaker Nick Verbitsky was finally contacted by the Justice Department this past August about the whistleblowers he found for his film about Bear Stearns. It had been more than a year since those lawyers at Patterson Belknap first called him. 
>> I think, you know, the ease with which I found these people and the things that they were telling me... You know, it wouldn't have taken a lot of effort on the part of a regulatory entity in Washington to have done this. I'm an independent filmmaker, you know, I'm not a financial regulator, I'm not somebody who's running the SEC. It's like, you know, what have you guys been doing? What have you been looking at? I mean, I went out and found these people myself and, you know, in my spare time, basically. You know, and it... it was work, but it wasn't that hard. 
>> SMITH: We have been able to contact a number of people who were inside the banks, doing due diligence work as contractors, who all told us that they were never contacted by the Justice Department. 
>> Well, look. I can't talk in general about nondescript, anonymous whistleblowers. But here's what I can tell you. Whenever I personally have been in any public setting, I've invited whistleblowers to come forward. 
[00:48:59]



>> SMITH: But it shouldn't be so easy for journalists to go out and find whistblowers that, at this point, four years after the... the meltdown, that haven't been contacted by Justice. 
>> Martin, I don't accept... 
>> SMITH: No? 
>> I don't accept for one moment that you all are finding whistleblowers that we're not. What I do... let me continue. What I do believe is that when we speak to the whistleblowers, we have to make a determination whether what they say is really a criminal case. 
>> SMITH: We've talked to whistleblowers, we've talked to people inside the banks who've told me, "Yes, there was fraud that went on." 
>> And we've talked to hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of people in these investigations. 
>> SMITH: And you're saying, in not one of those cases, having interviewed hundreds of people and looked at these things, you can't find one person in this whole mess that you can establish beyond a reasonable doubt that was selling these things knowingly, intentionally, and defrauded the investors. 
>> We were not able to reach a level of... that would sustain beyond a reasonable doubt. We were not able to show criminal intent sufficiently enough to obtain, what we believe... to obtain a conviction. 
>> SMITH: Do you think the banks did all this unintentionally? 
>> No, I personally don't. But in the end, sure, I was frustrated. Lanny was frustrated. Lanny was disappointed. I'm sure he was. And so was I. But we knew professionally this was the decision that needed to be made. 
>> The jobs of tens of thousands of employees can literally be at stake. 
>> NARRATOR: In September 2012, Lanny Brer gave a speech explaining his reluctance to indict a major bank. 
>> Those are the kinds of considerations in white-collar cases that literally keep me up at night. 
>> SMITH: You gave a speech before the New York Bar Association. And in that speech, you made a reference to losing sleep at night worrying about what a lawsuit might result in at a large financial institution. 
[00:50:59]



>> Right. 
>> SMITH: Is that really the job of a prosecutor, to worry about anything other than simply pursuing justice? 
>> Well, I think I am pursuing justice. And I think the entire responsibility of the Department is to pursue justice. But in any given case, I think I and prosecutors around the country being responsible should speak to regulators, should speak to experts. Because if I bring a case against institution A, and as a result of bringing that case, there's some huge economic effect, if it creates a ripple effect so that suddenly, counter parties and other financial institutions or other companies that had nothing to do with this are affected badly... It's a factor we need to know and understand. 
>> That was very disturbing to me, very disturbing. That was never raised at any time during any of our discussions. That is not the job of a prosecutor, to worry about the health of the banks, in my opinion. Job the prosecutor is to prosecute criminal behavior. It's not to lie awake at night and kind of decide the future of the banks. 
>> SMITH: So is Wall Street breathing a sigh of relief? 
>> I don't think people are breathing a sigh of relief, given the level of other litigation that's out there. However, I think there are probably a lot of individuals who have breathed sighs of relief over the last two or three years. 
>> NARRATOR: So far, in civil proceedings, the government has levied several billion dollars in penalties for misconduct in a crisis that's cost investors and homeowners many hundreds of billions of dollars. But to date, not one senior Wall Street executive has been held criminally liable by the Department of Justice for activities related to the financial crisis.

=======================================================

For you. ???????????? ???????????? ???????????? 
>> Sean: Welcome to hannity. This is fox news alert. We are following two breaking news stories. First there is breaking details about the justice department's targeting fox news's chief correspondent james rosen. We have obtained documents from the district court involving him hours ago. With more than 30 different phone records the ex changes matched locations of our white house, pentagon and operation and state department and even fox management. We'll have a lot more on the developing story. Rudy guliani and ann coulter will weigh in and there are4 people that have been killed nine of them children after yesterday's tornado ripped through oklahoma. Earlier today the state's governor that rescue crews are having a hard time navigating various neighborhoods because of all the destruction. To the latest we go to alicia standing by the scene tonight. 
>> That death toll number has been revised since last night's figure which is something we had expected. Originally they told everyone to prepare themselves for the number of children that were killed in the plaza towers elementary school to go up. However, there haseen solace in hearing that number has been adjusted down. Nine children, seven in the elementary school. The hospitals I can tell you is busy treating more than 200 people. A lot of them are kids. The cleanup and digout continues and it's such a big task and also dangerous. National guard members are trying to keep the area secure and keep email out. That is not easy. And with interstate 35 on open, but exits into the area are closed. Some people are saying this red cross shelter, either coming here to rest or coming here to up supplies and get information trying to find out about people that are missing. I can tell you that the folks here are telling me they have plenty of diapers and wipes and formulas. They have parents helping out and they are in need of batteries. They need "c" and "d" batteries and this is the moore community center where a lot of people are coming to either get food, drinks or at least some rest and some information. 
[00:02:32]



>> Sean: Thank you so much. Joining us now on the phone. Oklahoma city police department. Master sergeant gary knight is with us. I know the area of moore very well. I've often traveled between norman and oklahoma city. Let's talk about the degree of devastation, where you are right now with the search and rescue mission? 
>> As far as oklahoma city goes, it's changed from a rescue to a recovery type of situation for us. We have total of four people killed. Remainder would have been killed in moore. Moore 1 rescue mode, but in oklahoma city we're trying to get the streets back open. People are going to have to be patient because there are levels of destruction and devastation. Neighborhoods were just wiped completely clean and we're trying our best to get the roads open as soon as possible. 
>> Sean: Is there no longer a search for potential survivors? 
>> In oklahoma city, again, we believe we have everybody accounted for in our city, but moore took the brunt of the tornado. They have more devastation than oklahoma city. Rescue effort is still going on there. Oklahoma still we've moved to recovery mode. 
>> Sean: This is tornado alley and other states, arkansas, texas, missouri, tell us about the warning systems that you have in place and how well do you feel or assess that it worked in this instance? 
>> We had several days notice. The people that did the weather, local television stations or national weather service do an excellent job of predicting these things, we knew several days out there was high level of probability for a tornadic outbreak. That did come to fruition. We saw many tornadoes. We had not a lot of warning time once the tornado was on the ground, just a matter of minutes before it struck southwest oklahoma city and the city of moore. Here in this part of the country again you mentioned this tornado alley, people here to be weather aware. They deal with tornadoes on a regular basis much like people on the west coast that may be more aware of earthquakes than other parts of the country. 
[00:04:53]



>> Sean: I know a lot of people have been writing, tweeting, how best to be able to help. 
>> Really the best way to help is to go through services like the red cross, the united way. Red cross I know has a donation program set up for people can text to the red cross and make a donation through their cellphone. That really is the best way the public can help zbloors. 
>> Sean: Our prayers are with you tonight. Joining us now moore state REPRESENTATIVE, mark McBride. Our thoughts and prayers, sir, from us. Obviously you are going to get a lot of help and rainy day fund but a lot of people are going to be housing food, water, shelter everything that one could imagine? 
>> Yeah, it's one of those things you have to take it one day at a time. Every day is going to present a new challenge. I was up in my helicopter, they took me up an hour or two ago and I had a look at damage. It's very devastating. My heart goes out to these people. My family moved to moore like in the mid 1940s so you can imagine family and friends we have in the community. The people that we know. My own parents, they had their house, it was destroyed. I haven't been able to talk to my parents too much. I've been really busy here with my family, 40,000 people or 37,000 I represent here. She rode it out underneath the stairway in their home. It's been quite experience. 
>> Sean: Sorry to hear about your parents' home. Everything they have are in these homes. Then a lot of them are thankful I came you on out with my life because this is so dangerous. Do you think looking into the future, knowing how devastating this all could be, would it be in everybody's best interests if they had shelter that is under ground that is separate and apart from their house. I know a lot of people do have it. 
[00:07:13]



>> I've lived here all my life. I don't have a storm shelter. I guess I think I'm going to dodge the bullet. It came within a quarter of my home. I think I'll own one now. I don't know why we don't. People choose not to own a storm shelter. It rapid these houses off the slab. That more people than 24 weren't killed or injured, I guess it was 200 or something injured. That is small number compared to what I flew over. 
>> Sean: Mark, thanks for being with us. Our thoughts and prayers is with all the community.

>> Sean: This is a fox news alerted. We have been reporting that obama justice department has targeted fox news chief james rosen and tonight fox news has obtained the documents from the u.S. District court which contain very shocking information. For the very latest. We go live to shannon bream. Standing by live tonight which is huge development. 
>> Reporter: Personal emails and phone records they go far beyond james rosen's information. In a court filing dated october 13, 2011, government details numerous pieces of evidence it has collected including scores of phone records that have area codes and exchanges that match up to many fox news hard lines and cellphones. Redacted version of that document we can't see the final four numbers on each of phone numbers but the area code and exchanges match up to fox employee and office phones including the phone lines that run to our work space at the white house, at the pentagon and at the state department. The records also appear to show the justice department gathered phone records rank today fox news executives. We have reached out to the justice department and white house for commented. White house press secretary tells our colleague, quote, can't comment on an ongoing criminal investigation. These new revelations come on the heel that has an f.B.I. Signed an affidavit accusing rosen of committing a crime by alleging getting information from a state department employee and gave access to personal email accounts. 
>> Sean: Thank you very much. Joining me reaction with the breaking news story. Former mayor rudy guliani you are a former prosecutor. 15 years, u.S. Attorney, associate attorney general and assistant u.S. Attorney. 
>> Sean: They are claiming they got a case of espionage. So they want to find out where the leak came from. So, they seize not only james' emails and go through phone records and target him as an aider and abettor and co-conspirer. 
[00:14:29]



>> Sean, that is almost impossible to have happened. I can't imagine how you would name a reporter as a co-conspirator when all the reporter was doing was their job. The obligation is the government employee. They take the oath of office. They have the obligation not to leak sensitive or classified information. A reporter is supposed to ask questions. It's the government official that knows the obligation that they have. I can't imagine in all of this, I never heard of a reporter being named as an co-conspirator. I think mr. Rosen consider a libel suit against the justice department. I think they defamed him unfairly totally outrageous behavior but we're getting use to two or three a day. I look at the justice department and I feel like the wheels are coming off the justice department. 
>> Sean: It sounds to me they decided toave carte blanche to spy? 
>> They sure did. There is no question that they did. There are so many surgical ways you could do this. This is an attempt to pry into the records and fox's records. It's no different in the irs going after the conservative groups. He knows, they knew what bidding they were doing going after fox. 
>> Sean: What about fox's hard lines, not having anything to do with james rosen at pentagon, at the state department, the white house work space and fox executives as if somehow 
-- 
-- 
>> I don't know if there is an enemies' list, including the tea party and patriot groups and fox news. To be named as co-conspirator, i think it's illegal. 
[00:16:31]



>> Sean: This is the reason we need a free press. Isn't it to keep government in power in check? 
>> Absolutely. There are lines here that are clear. The press has every right to probe, to push and ask questions. It's the government official that has the obligation. I don't know if this government official violated his obligation or not. A reporter asking for information certainly shouldn't be named as unindicted co-conspirator. 
>> Sean: Do you think its pattern, they have an ongoing war with fox news channel. 
>> How can you miss the fact there is a pattern here. We also have the irs going after right wing groups. It seems to me that the people of this administration got the signal from the top, go after these people. It's like murder in the cathedral when henry ii said rid me this of priest and killed beckett. 
>> Sean: What do you make of it? 
>> I think we can say criminal matter. She is taking the fifth amendment. She is saying the answer may incriminate her. So the reality is, that can't be used against her in court of law, but we have a right to draw the inference there is some criminality involved here. 
>> Sean: We heard 
-- there have been five separate stories, jay carney giving many of them that they knew nothing about it. They found this out in the press. Then we find out the president's attorney knew, the president's chief of staff knew about it. But supposedly they didn't tell the president. 
>> We should regard any statement by carney as the first attempt. Let's wait until tomorrow and day after and we'll find out the truth. I don't know how long he is going to last. The president has to have a press secretary that people trust. I don't know how many times he can be wrong, hide the truth. Maybe he is shut out from the information. 
[00:18:32]



>> Sean: For his own credibility he would want the information. When you put together with the shift in benghazi and shifting story who knew what, when, it's changed five times. What emerging when you come bear benghazi, nobody knew. A number of people knew? 
>> Before you jump to any further conclusions, have an extremely incompetent administration. They can't get their story straight. When they have days of warning they can't get their stories straight. President finds out about the irs investigation by reading the newspapers? What does he have a staff for? What about the people working, get rid of them, just read the newspapers. 
>> Sean: Lerner is going to plead the fifth. The story that this story came out spontaneously. 
[ Laughter ] 
>> Sean:. 
>> I don't know what the criminality is, but when you invoke the fifth amendment, you have to feel that you are going to be incriminated. They were saying there is a criminality, somebody should be prosecuted. It turns out they are right. She won't be invoking the fifth amendment. 
>> Sean: One common thread, abuse of power. One other thing, this is not political for me. As a conservative, I want my government to be truthful. I think the families in benghazi need to the truth. I think conservative tea party groups deserve the truth. I think we need the truth about why james rosen was targeted. 
>> I think the only thing that will save this, president has to explain all this. It has to come from the president. Exactly what did he know about benghazi, where was he? Why weren't forces sent there as they should have been? Why wasn't security supplied in advance? Why did the irs do this? Why did this information never seem to get to him? We need explanation so we can trust him. Even if we disagree with him ideologically. Now it's gotten to the point i can't imagine can trust anything they say, because next day it turns out to be false. He has to straightened it out. 
[00:20:49]



>> Sean: Still ahead, ann coulter's reaction to the justice department targeting reporters at fox news channel. Coming up next.... 
>> That is lie by omission. There is is no question about that in my mind. 
>> I did not lie. 
>> You what? 
>> I did not lie, sir.

>> Sean: Tonight breaking news to the irs enemies list scandal. Head of the tax agency's exempt division will invoke the fifth amendment. Lois lerner is scheduled to testify tomorrow but instead she will refuse to answer about the irs efforts to target conservatives. This is major development considering the treasury's dartment i.G. Report that lerner found out about the witch hunts way back in june 2011. Rather than alert members of congress, she kept it to herself. Meanwhile, the former commissioner he appeared on capitol hill this morning and he was asked for first time about his role in the scandal. Although he was in charge of the tax agency when all these politically witch hunts were taken place, he had very few answers for members of the sena finance committee and needless to say the q&a session got heated at times. Let's take a look. 
>> I was dismayed, I was saddened to read the inspector general's conclusion. How did this happen? 
>> Mr. Chairman, I can't say i know that answer. I'm six months 
-- 
>> you got sense. You've been a commissioner for number of years. 
>> I'm six months out of office. I don't think I can answer that question. 
>> You've had time to think about this. 
>> That is lie by omission. There is no question about that in my mind. Why did you mislead me and my colleagues, my fellow senators and most importantly the american people by failing to tell us what you knew about the exact subject we were asking about? Why didn't you tell us? 
>> Mr. Hatch, I did not lie. I did not lie, sir. 
>> You knew what was going on and you knew what we had asked. 
[00:27:48]



>> The first day from the white house learn about any tea party groups that applied for tax exempt status being to more scrutiny? 
>> I have no knowledge. 
>> I am certainly not personally responsible for creating a list. 
>> It's easy, two words. 
>> I understand the words. What I'm telling you, this happened on my watch and i accept that. 
>> But you are not personally responsible? 
>> I am deeply regretful it happened. 
>> Okay, never mind. 
>> Sean: Today's hearing another glaring example of the administration's culture of cooperation where nobody seems to take responsible and nobody is held accountable for these, quote, mistakes and a joining us that were on hand, rob port man and south dakota senator john thune. Senator portman, give us your take away from today. 
>> Hings. One, clearly we need more information because the i.G. Told us this was an audit and not an investigation. He didn't ask the tough questions. He didn't subpoena folks. He didn't ask the treasury department or white house when they knew it. We have to do more. That is why the investigation needs to proceed. If a bipartisan investigation it's appropriate we dig into this. This is classic example and think benghazi is, too, of unfortunately a troubling pattern in this administration to put politics ahead of public interest. We learned today, not only was this outrageous conduct of targeting american citizens, something we are learning much more about, but also that they knew about this and yet didn't tell members of congress who had specifically raised questions about it. I personally had sent a letter WITH SENATOR HATCH, MARCH 14th. They knew about this. This is 2012. Yet a week after the response, they get a full briefing they don't bother to tell us. This is why you heard from senator hatch, he said look, this is not telling the truth. He said it was lie by omission, they knew what was going on yet they didn't tell members of congress. This means that the american people didn't hear about it. It means that it was not checked like it could have been. 
[00:30:15]



>> Sean: Shocking development. Senator thune, the treasury i.G. Says the top official knew about this enemies' list as early as june 2011. 
>> From may 2010 through may of 2012 a team of specialists referred to as the determination unit selected 298 cases for additional scrutiny. We found that the first time executives from washington, d.C. Became aware of the use of these criteria was june 2011. 
>> Sean: Found that executives in d.C. Were aware of it. Two developments today, senator thune, we learned that jay carney said nobody knew earlier. In fact the president's lawyer, the president's chief of staff knew earlier than what jay carney was telling us. You can put that together and piece that together for us, please? 
>> One thing, lois lerner is taking the fifth which would suggestion an admission of guilt right there. As senator portman pointed out we got nor non-answers than answers. Steve miller and paul shulman who testified in front of the house committee in march of 2012 there wasn't any targeting. And found out subsequently there was and for months said nothing about it. Despite repeated requests for information that came from the committee. If you look the way it was played out there were a lot of people who knew what was going on. I asked if there were conversations about the treasury department and treasury-secretary knew this of june 2012. You have to wonder about how the political schedule impacted this coming out. WHITE HOUSE DID KNOW APRIL 24th, At least that is what we're told the general counsel was informed about this and conveyed to the chief of staff. This wasn't announced until may 10 tha at aba con convention by lois lerner. That is why I tnk we need to have more hearings and more opportunities to get the facts out in front of the american people. 
[00:32:29]



>> Sean: Let me go back to stable condition, and dan pfeiffer was on all these programs. He said the law is irrelevant. 
>> Let me! Ask all of you because there was statement made over the weekend by somebody from the white house the law would be irrelevant. Do you believe that the law is irrelevant or is relevant to this? 
>> I believe the law is also relevant, sir. 
>> There was a statement made over the weekend whether the laws were broken. I'm just asking that the laws are relevant in this case? 
>> I guess I would agree with the inspector general people should not break the law. 
>> Sean: I was shocked by your exchange there. 
>> He did. That was precisely the point i was getting at. If there were laws broken and inspector general did say that if they took confidential information and gave it to someone else, in this case pro bublica that would be a violation of law. Is that relevant? I think the american people believe it's relevant. It was hard to get the deputy commissioner and the former commissioner to acknowledge that the law was relevant. Inspector general didn't seem to have a problem with that. 
>> I was on that sunday show. I followed pfeiffer, I was surprised, as well. But giving him the benefit of the doubt. I think what he meant to say whether it's illegal or not, giving the benefit on, that what he said to me was more outrageous this is about republicans going after a political issue when they should be talking about policy, trying to distrack the country. This is real issue and this is about american citizens that were mistreated. All of us wanted to see tax reform. We're the ones pushing to get the budget under control. We have a policy agenda and president is not working with us on. The notion this is political witch hunt by republicans is just false. What we're trying to do is stand up the american people and constituents. 
[00:34:43]



>> Sean: The issue is not disputed. They admitted to the idea they have targeted tea party groups. It's the question of who knew, how did it get set up so it doesn't happen to liberals or conservatives. First it was tea party and reporters of the a.P. And now targeted go a number of journalists and producers right here at the fox news channel. Hours ago we obtained court documents. When we return, ever so lively ann coulter. Then later tonight. 
>> I never lost consciousness. They didn't answer. So he is in there somewhere. 
>> Sean: I am picking the video of the day. Making that comment the tornado survivor was reunited with her beloved dog and most heartwarming of the video today. We will play tonight on hannity. feelings, todd. I did? When visa signature asked everybody what upgraded experiences really mattered...

>>> Fox news alert. New developments tonight regarding the obama justice department'so targeted chief correspondent james rosen. Earlier tonight fox obtained court documents that show the u.S. District course seized phone records including the lines at work space, pentagon, state department. Records also appear to show that the justice department gathered phone records linked to fox news executives. Here is reaction to this disturbing news is columnist, author ann coulter. What is your visceral reaction to this? Mine is like wow! This is big brother? 
>> Yes, and especially in the middle of all of these other things and the targeting of the tea party groups and the lying about benghazi. I mean the whole mix of it. My first reaction is to reflect that under the bush administration when many of the news outlets that are not reporting the james rosen reading about it on fox news. 
>> Valerie plane? 
>> No, they are revealing national security that would harm all americans including "new york times," by the way. They revealed the u.S. Was following tracing phone calls that were found on terrorist computers. That broke and got the first terrorist computers, get their cellphones. They started trying to follow who is calling these phone numbers. That was revealed by the "new york times," then they revealed a top secret to track al-qaeda's financing where the money was going. They were specifically asked not only by bush and cheney but by democratic congressmen, we are going to put america at risk. And dana at washington post yielded the rendition program and secret camps c.I.A. Prisons being in eastern europe. Destroying our relationship with our important allies. You guys can't keep a secret. "Washington post" put in to the front page. And then, dana priest won the prize for putting mechanic at rick. What is the national security here? Two weeks the obama administration was tapping a.P. Phones, at first I was totally on eric holder's side which is to say, look it's national security, if this going to get put any americans in danger, harm or national security interests, fine. Then look at the phone numbers being called by a.P., And then it turns out they are tapping them because they want to be scooped. It has nothing to do with national security. Anything in the remove sen case that has to do with national security --. 
[00:42:50]



>> Sean: Remember david sanger reflects well on the obama administration when they had drone strikes and seal team 6 killed osama bin laden. Bob gates, shut the blank up. 
>> Right. Obama himself will reveal actually national security information that will harm the united states if it reflects on him. Burr here in this case, the big story that they are claiming was national security leak is north korea was going to start testing nukes again in response to u.N. Sanctions, this is not like we're dealing with a tracking program. 
>> Sean: This is deeper. I wanted your thoughts. 
>> Bush administration didn't talk to either the newspapers or media in those cases. 
>> Sean: This is how far they went. 80 abetting co-conspirator in an es knee entangling case and they are tapping our bureau, our pentagon, our state department and our executives? 
>> It does sound very disturbing mayor rudy guliani covered some of this journalists have extra privileges. But beyond that you can't do this to any american unless it will harm national security. That is what the felony is. Where the felony here? Why was no indictment ever brought? And this is news organization and the you have this and targeting the tea party groups and patriot groups and lying to the parents of the people that who died in benghazi. Are they going to blame all of this on the cincinnati office and low level worker? 
>> Sean: I don't mean to laugh. That was good line. We need to take a break. Much more with ann coulter. Don't forget. We wanted to hear from you. Log on to our special come pan yon site. Follow the live show and share your thoughts and you can even talk to anne. You can do it twitter at sean hannity. I decided your humble host the most heartwarming video of the day and that is coming up. 
[00:45:11]



>> Lying there in the rubble, i never lost consciousness i hollered for my little dog and he didn't answer. So I know he is in there somewhere. 
>> Sean: You have to see this an elderly tornado survivor with a dog she thought she lost. It happened live on national television. That will be a video of the day. You don't want to miss this. That is straight ahead. 
[00:49:52]



>>> Welcome back to hannity. We continue with ann coulter. Fifth amendment. How do you read that as a lawyer? 
>> As giuliani was saying, i watched it before coming on. You can only plead the fifth if you could be incriminated in a crime, not because you don't feel like answering. That tells us something. Republicans in light of the tornado, the media was looking for any excuse not to cover this. You have the tornado, I think republicans should say, look, this is important news. Because of the news value of the tornado, we're going to put our hearings off for a week or two. I mean, monday, before the tornado it hit, "the new york times" didn't manage to mention anything about the irs scandal on its front page and every time it does mention it, it's look at what republicans are doing with this issue. I mean, this is a very important issue and you know, back to blaming it all on the cincinnati office. Their claim is from "the new york times," it was a strange front page article the times had on sunday by a reporter who is otherwise pretty good. He apparently hasn't been following the news on the story he was reporting. Even the news in his own newspaper. Because he keeps pushing the angle of oh, there was just chaos and confusion. They were overworked. The overworked excuse ought to explain why they were rubber stamping evething. Not why they're going into overdrive and doing more work and harassing tea party and what their tweets are and every member of their family and resumes. They're saying we worked hard to harass partiers because we were overworked. Then you look at true the vote, one of the groups who applied for 501 c 3 and 4 status. Statement they're audited by the overworked cincinnati office, they're being investigated by the fbi, by the atf, because they were at a manufacturing plant with a license to make guns and they weren't making guns. 
>> Epa. 
>> Osha. There was one person the boss of all the organizations and congress better find out they need to prosecute the low-level individuals in order to get them to get where it came from. 
[00:52:03]



>> Jay carney denied anybody in the white house knew. He's given five different stories about this. But now we found out that the president's lawyer. 
>> Right. 
>> White house counsel and the chief of staff. 
>> Right. 
>> Did in fact know, which carney originally denied anybody knowing. 
>> Right. How many people directly associated with obama have to know for us to assume that looks like obama knew. But the way you find out is by, look, if people broke the law by prosecuting them and unless you get the cincinnati office to take the fall for benghazi, irs, atf and now the investigation of fox news, I think you're going to work your way up the chain. But the republicans ought to put it off until next week because they weren't covering it already. They're definitely not covering it a few days after a massive horrible tornado. 
>> AN ATMs FAULT, RUSH Limbaugh's fault, fox's fault, my fault, your fault, levine's fault. 
>> Why can't they pick it up next week? 
>> They will, I have no doubt. This is dicey for them. I only have ten seconds. 
>> It's a disaster. All I have to say is, I wish they would start tapping my phone. I think they would find it he had fieing. 
>> They might learn something. 
>> I don't want my phone tapped. 
>> They might catch us cursing occasionally. 
>>> Coming up next, you don't want to miss this video. It will tug at your heartstrings. We'll show you the incredible moment when a tornado survivor was reunited with her beloved dog. That's coming up next. ??????

>>> It is without question the most heartwarming video of the day. It happened yesterday when tornado survivor barbara garcia was talking to a reporter about wh happened when the storm hit her home. All of a sudden, the conversation, well, was interrupted when her little dog's head peeked through out of the rubble. 
>> I was holding my dog, sitting on the stool holding my dog. This was a game plan all through the years. You know, to go in that little bathroom. I felt the stool come up out of the floor. And I rolled around a little bit. And when it stopped, I was right there that presto cooker is what I saw. 
>> You were lying there in the rubble. 
>> And I never lost consciousness. And I hollered for my little dog and he didn't answer. Didn't come. So I know he's in here somewhere. This is life in the big city. 
>> The dog, the dog. 
>> The dog. 
>> Hi puppy. 
>> The dog. 
>> Oh, oh, baby. Bless your little bitty heart. Help me. 
>> Oh, oh, oh, come on. 
>> Can you get him? 
>> Oh, oh, well, I think god answered one prayer for me to be okay. He answered both of them because this was my second prayer. 
>> By all accounts the dog and ms. Garcia are both okay. With all the bad news coming out of this terrible storm, it is really nice to see an uplifting moment like that. We wish them well.

=======================================================

Scene from the book of revelation. Where the sun became dark, and the sky was split apart. "Hardball" is next. 
>>> Good evening. I'm chris matthews in washington. Rescue efforts in the oklahoma city suburb of moore are still under way. More than 24 hours after a devastating tornado ripped through the region. Here's what we know right now. At least 24 people were killed. That number includes at least nine children. Seven of whom died at al elementary school stuck in the storm's path. Nearly 240 others were injured. Both those numbers could go up in the coming days. Throughout the community, homes were blown away. Schools and hospitals were demolished. Neighborhoods are in ruin. Today, heavy rain and lightning slowed the rescue effort. More than 100 people have been pulled from the rubble just so far. Meanwhile the national weather service upgraded the storm to an ef-5, strongest rating for a tornado. Ef-5. The president declared a disaster area in oklahoma today. He spoke from the white house earlier. 
>> The people of moore should know that their country will remaining on the ground, there for them, beside them, as long as it takes. For there are homes and schools to rebuild. Businesses and hospitals to re-open. There are parents to console. First responders to comfort. And, of course, frightened children who will need our continued love and attention. 
>> Well, the president also reached out to oklahoma governor mary fallin. This afternoon the governor, herself, spoke about the unbelievable tragedy in oklahoma. 
>> It's been a very trying couple of days for the state of oklahoma. It's a sad time for us because we've experienced one of our most horrific storms and disasters that the state has ever faced. But yet in the midst of tragedy and loss of life, we've also seen the resilience and the courage and the strength of our people, and we will get through this. We will overcome and we will rebuild and we will regain our strength. 
[00:02:23]



>> Meanwhile, there's potential for more severe weather this evening in northern texas, arkansas, and parts of louisiana and oklahoma. Msnbc's chris jansing has been on the ground in moore, oklahoma, all this day. She joins us now. Thank you so much, chris, my colleague. What is it like down there? I just want to get a sense that we can't see on the tv. 
>> Reporter: It's hard. Really to put into words, chris. As I drove in here, it almost didn't really seem real. It seemed like it was the set of a movie, it wasn't possible. That I had never seen. And people who cover storms had never seen. Destruction like this. This is what happens with 200 mile per hour winds. Entire neighborhoods wiped out. I mean, there you see some folks who are just going through the painstaking work of looking at what's left of their house which isn't much. Some people just trying to find usually things that are sentimental to them, like photographs or pie jewelry. It goes on block after block after block. We heard stories of horses 
-- there's a lot of farmland around here. Horses flying in the air. We see piles of cars across the street in the parking lot. Five, six deep. There's even a car on top of the medical center across the street. The devastation is almost unbelievable. They are still doing the painstaking work of going through the rubble. They don't believe, chris, at this point that there are any people trapped, but they don't want to rule out the possibility and they're getting calls. They got a call just a few minutes ago. We were listening on the radio of people who think they hear or see something. In this case, it was at one of the storm shelters, and so they sent people over to check it out. So this is going to be an ongoing process here. Obviously. The first thing they're doing is making sure that there isn't anybody trapped. Beyond that, to even assess the damage and then start to think about rebuilding, chris. 
>> You know, it looked like a neutron bomb hit. You've heard about neutron bombs in the old days. I'm sure they still exist where they bomb the buildings, they don't necessarily kill the people through contamination. People, we've watched all these pictures 
-- we've seen live horses. We haven't seen dead horses. We've heard about casualties. We certainly have them by the hundreds now. We haven't seen them on the ground. Did a lot of people just basically get the word and get out of there? 
[00:04:41]



>> Reporter: Well, one of the things that happened, chris, was this happened during the day and a lot of times this happens at night and people are asleep in their beds. Though there was only 16 minutes warning, people had an idea it was coming and they were able to, you know, get to their shelters or get into a basement. We're just down the street from a movie theater, and people who were in there watching a movie described that all of a sudden all the phones started to light up. It was a weather warning that people were getting on their phones so they all were moved out into a hallway. They were up against the wall. And when they walked out of that movie theater, which by the way is still standing, everything else they saw around them was pretty much gone. So that's what it was like, but I think they do believe that the fact that it happened during the day, and one more thing, chris, I think this is important, you know, this storm hit this town, this suburb of oklahoma city almost exactly the same way that it hit in 1999. And the folks who were here in 1999 will tell you they offered them the opportunity to get some help to build storm shelters, and a lot of people did. And the mayor told me this morning that he thinks if that help wasn't available and so many people hadn't built storm shelters that the devastation and the loss of life could have been much, much worse. 
>> We've heard so much from the local people, and it's got to be authoritative, because there are lives at stake, that the ground is too hard to get through, that the water table is too high. What is the safe place 
-- is there a known structure or a known, I guess, a basement? What is a safe place to reliably wait out one of these tornadoes when you know an ef-5 is coming your way? Is there a safe place for sure? 
>> Reporter: There are storm shelters. There are storm shelters, and people went there. Is any place safe absolutely for sure? People will tell you it's not. But the other thing that folks here will tell you, because you ask them, well, if you were here in 1999 and are still here again, will you stay? Everybody I talked to said they would. This is something you're brought up with and you learn and you drill it in school and many parents talk to their kids about it. And it almost instinctively when I talk to some people, one guy was across the street and decided he had to get home. Instinctively he knew what closet he was going to go to and everything fell around him and he was okay. 
[00:07:03]



>> Wow. 
>> Reporter: So is anything 100% safe? No. But there are storm shelters. People have built their own storm shelters. And they do know where to go. And there are procedures. Because if you think, chris, of a multiplex movie theater and the people that we talk to, they got into the hall and everybody seemed to be pretty organized. Nobody talked about it being chaotic. That's pretty remarkable. I think it speaks to the fact that this is a place where tornadoes happen and people know what to do. 
>> You mentioned schools. Tell me what we know about plaza towers. Last night we got a report, fortunately it wasn't accurate, of 24 kids being killed. A local news report apparently was being passed around by authorities. It turns out it was less than that. But the fact that they chose, the teachers, as the smart move, the safest move was to keep the kids in a stronger structure at a school building, get them against a wall in the safest part of the building and hope for the best. What do we know about what happened following that procedure? 
>> Reporter: Well, let me tell you. One of the things that gave me chills, and there are always stories of heroism that come out of these tragedies, chris. One of the stories is of a teacher who got her kids to the safe place and then worried that the roof was going to come off, and, in fact, the ceiling did collapse. Had them all go down and she put her arms around them and covered their heads. One of the fathers said that he has absolutely no doubt she saved the life of her young students that day. She is hospitalized. He said that the storm was so powerful it actually pulled eye glasses off of the kids. But there she was taking care of them. Another teacher who was at a preschool and the kids were understandably very upset. Some of them were crying and some of them were yelling. And she had taught them this song"you are my sunshine" and got them all singing the song so they would stay calm and nobody would try to run away and they would all be safe. I think that's just more of the remarkable stories. It reminded me so much of newtown and the heroism of teachers and how under the most stressful circumstances they seem instinctively, and I'm sure through trainly as well, know what to do. 
[00:09:10]



>> So do you, chris jansing. It's great to have you on the ground when something good or bad happens. Thanks for being here. Savannah guthrie spoke with a teacher at plaza towers, an elementary school that chris jansing mentioned. Crosswhite protected her students as we herd from chris by lying on top of them and comforting with them throughout the deal. Crosswhite reunited with one of those students during her interview with savannah. Here it is. 
>> I was in a stall. It started coming down. I laid on top of them. One of my little boys said, i love you, I love you, please don't die with me. I never thought I was going to die. The whole time I just kept screaming to them, quit worrying, we're fine, we're fine, we're fine, we're fine. 
>> Reporter: I do have a student here who wants to say thank you to you. This is damian klein. And his mom, brandy. 
>> I told you we were going to be okay. 
>> Alfredo, marimaria, and vivian that luna survived yesterday in their storm shelter. Thank you. Tell us your decision to build a storm shelter. What works or doesn't in these ef-5 tornadoes? 
>> The only thing I can say about the storm cellars, that's the only way to go especially when you have a tornado this big. You know, the news, the weathermen tell you all the time if it's that big, if you're above ground, you're not going to survive it. So I mean, really the only thing I can tell people is, you know, the seriousness of having a storm cellar is at a ten. 
>> And people have told me in the last 24 hours that it's hard to build because the ground is so hard down there. Is it expensive or difficult to put a shelter in? To dig it in the ground? 
>> You know, I mean, the clay here, it's red clay so the clay is 
-- the dirt is hard. Expensive-wise, honestly, i mean, it's probably a few thousand dollars. 
[00:11:17]



>> Yeah. 5,000 or $6,000 the last i knew. 
>> And let me ask maria luna, your wife about how you managed to get the whole family to the shelter in time to avoid horror. 
>> Well, to be honest with you, I was at work when all this happened. It was alfredo and actually vivi, my daughter that was there by herself at the house. And then alfredo got home. He's the one who told her to go into the shelter because the tornado was close. But me being at work, I was really worried because there were no cell phone lines. There was no communication. I couldn't get ahold of them. So I was really worried about them. 
>> Viviana, you just survived one of the biggest tornadoes ever to hit your area. What are you going to be able to tell people what it was like, how you got the warning, how much time you had? What it was like racing to the shelter? 
>> This is something that is honestly unexplainable. I can't even begin to tell you how I feel or how I felt during this whole experience. There wasn't much time between getting from my house to the shelter just because the tornado was already so close. I'm just still in shock as of everything that's been happening. 
>> How much warning did you get? 
>> I got maybe about five or ten minutes' warning, then once alfredo got home, he told me to get my butt in the shelter an that's exactly what I did. 
>> Alfredo, how much time did you have to get your daughter, or get this whole thing organized? 
>> You know, we actually, you know, we listened to the news the day before, you know. We had the big tornadoes that hit shawnee. And the weathermen basically told us we were going to have the same type of outbreak the next day. So we were already kind of a little bit warned on that part of it. So we kind of knew when the outbreak was going to kind of form and start up and we just, you know, I was at my office with a few of my business partners, and we just got on our laptops, pulled up the radar to kind of see where things were going. They were just getting really bad so we made the executive decision to go toy house where we have the storm cellar. It was probably, you know, from getting there to the house, we probably orchestrated, oh, we probably had less than maybe five minutes at the most. 
[00:13:46]



>> Good work. Good work for you. Congratulations. I shouldn't say that because this is still a horror for the community, but you did the right thing. Alfredo, thank you.

>>> Stand in front, and I heard the roar of the tornado. And then I grabbed my dog and we went and laid down in the closet. Saw the glass breaking, things crashing and rumbling. And the ceiling, the roof tore off. And I could see little holes starting to develop in the ceiling. And I could actually see the tornado. 
>> That's a good account there. Welcome back to "hardball." Local, state and federal officials have been out in full force responding to the disaster left by yesterday's tornado. Let's go back to moore, oklahoma, where lieutenant governor todd lamb is there. Joins us there. Welcome, governor. Thank you for joining us. Give us a sense in your authority positght now, what's getting done, fema, how things stand in terms of dealing with this incredible disaster? 
>> Chris, it's absolutely who risk. You see the images on the television. It pales in comparison to real life. Absolutely, the devastation is horrific. I was with the governor yesterday at the emergency operations cente she spoke to the president. She made the request to fema. Everything that's been requested by the state of oklahoma to the federal authorities, to the president, and to fema, every request has been granted. And we're receiving federal assistance at this time. 
>> So how does it work now, just so we'd like to get a sense, i would, of how it works. You call washington, you call fu gate. How does it work state to government, in these kind of catastrophes? 
>> Yesterday, shortly after the tornado completed its devastation in moore, oklahoma, governor fallin called the regional, ashwood and went through a formal procedure of requesting federal assistance for the four counties affected from the tornadoes the day before and a tornado here in moore yesterday. That was the semantics of going through the process. That would allow us in oklahoma, in any state for that matter, that goes through the process to begin removing the regulation to hire contracts, contract workers, and remove the competitive bid process to seek relief on a quicker basis for emergencies such as this. 
[00:19:37]



>> I've gotten an education on what you do in these situations and how devastating it can be. Under around the new york city area, breezy point, places like staten island, the rockaways, where all the electricity is blown away. You have people' electrical systems are blown away, where the houses are declared basically unlivable and you have to deal with almost a rock bottom situation where whole communities have to be rebuilt, especially the electrical systems, sewer systems, water systems. How do you do the triage in the next couple months, in fact, the next couple of days? 
>> It's the assessment process. You hit the nail on the head, chris. It's one thing to go through the rescue efforts we're going through right now and the recovery efforts we're going through right now. The cleanup we're going through right now. I've talked to many people that asked me, what are my thoughts? Well, don't forget oklahoma in three days. Don't forget oklahoma in one week. Don't forget oklahoma in three weeks. Moore, oklahoma, where we are, you've said it many times, i know already, on your program. This is the third time we've had this go through moore. 1999, 2003, and yesterday. We will rebuild. We're a strong people. We're a people of faith and a people of hope. But it's going to be a long process to go through the rescue, recovery and cleanup. As you said, power's out. Electricity is down. There are water issues right now. There's a long road ahead of us, but we will overcome once again. 
>> You know, we were just talk to a family whose lives were saved by being in a shelter. It didn't look like a very expensive shelter. A couple of thousand dollars. Alfredo corrales told us his personal family shelter. Is that something that should be part of the rebuilding? I know the ground down there is tough. There's a water level problem. But is there a possibility we can 
-- you can't ensure against this kind of disaster. Is there any way to prepare better than it's been prepared? Without casting any blame, of course, in the future. 
>> No, I understand your question. I think it's a fair question and an appropriate question whenever you see devastation of this magnitude, particularly as i said to the exponential number of three. I have a great relationship with congressman tom cole. I've known him for over two decades. He's a great statesman. And we're in his district right now. He's got boots on the ground, it's my understanding he's already arrived from washington. He's taking a tour right now with the governor. And I'll defer to congressman cole with any legislation he sponsors on capitol hill and what he thinks is best for his district that has been so devastated yesterday. 
[00:22:06]



>> I was just thinking maybe tax breaks for people or any kind of subsidy because we're all in this together. Maybe it's a good thing to encourage people to do the kind of thing the corraless family did. You live in that part of the country, the god be with us, it depends on the luck of the draw. I heard in the last 24 hours sometimes you can be on the same street and one house will get blown away and one won't. What are the vagueties of the tornadoes? They seem to cut almost irregularly. You can't figure them out. What's your experience in that regard? 
>> The term "freak of nature" applies no better than to the force of a tornado. I passed as I was coming down to moore this morning about 5:50 a.M. I passed by a shopping center. About four or five stores long. The bookend stores almost completely in tact. But the store in the very middle hollowed out. And the storm actually passed north to south over the mall. So my point is, they're freak of nature. You hear about straws of hay going through stock-a fences. That happens. There was a window knocked out. Two tornadoes 
-- excuse me, two days ago in a tornado. The window was knocked out in the shape of a heart in one of our hospitals in north oklahoma city in the edmond area. Theyeaks of nature. You never know what they're going to do or how they're going to impact a structure or a community. 
>> As a lifelong movie buff, i was happy to know, I mean this in all seriousness, they had an organized system at one of those cineplexs down there in that area and were able to get the people into the most strongest part of the movie structure. The cineplex structure. They got them in the hallway. Everything was done in an organized regular, really gutsy way and it worked. The people made it. 
>> It did work, and I'm 
-- chris, as I'm looking at the camera, that is just 
-- I'm looking right now at the theater of which you speak to show you how close it is to where we are standing. I know a father and a son who was going to see "star trek" yesterday afternoon and they hunkered down in that hallway and it was a horrific time is what the father said. 
[00:24:21]



>> And they got through it. 
>> They got through it. They survived and they got through it. 
>> Governor, it's great to talk to you. Lieutenant governor todd lamb of oklahoma. Hold in there, sir. 
>>> For oklahomans affected by the tornado, relief organization are on hand to help tonight. If you'd like to help, I'm sure you're thinking about it, here's the number. You can't forget this one. 1-800-red-cross. 1-800-red-cross. Or go to redcross.Org. Also text red cross to 90999. 90999. From your phone to automatically give 10 bucks to relief efforts.

>>> Welcome back to "hardball." The tornado that hit oklahoma yesterday was remarkable for its size, strength and the devastation it left behind as you can see. What were the conditions that called us to create such a monster funnel? Look at it there. Oh. Look at it. Well, it hit the town of moore, oklahoma. It hit so hard and so often. What caused all that. Joining me now is an expert. The weather channel's dr. Greg forbes. Dr. Forbes, thank you for being with us tonight. You know, we always like to understand nature because maybe in some part of our brain we think, our our soul, we hope we can have some impact of protecng ourselves and understanding what god's plan is, if you will. This tornado went to an ef-5. What does that tell you? Is this really the peak of what a tornado can be? 
[00:29:05]



>> Reporter: Yeah. The enhanced fujita scale, ef goes from 0 to 5. 5 is the highest. That means it had wind gusts at least in one location in excess of 200 miles an hour. 
>> When I'm looking at it, there it is, this is frightening. It's getting wide. It's getting wider. It starts as kind of a winding snake. First a fragmented snake then a complete snake. Then this winding funnel. Then apparently it widens to up to two miles. What is 
-- that didn't touch ground, would there be any devastation? Does it have to actually get to the ground visibly to cause the destruction? 
>> Reporter: Sometimes for the very narrowest of tornadoes, the funnel coming down from a cloud will remain there, but if you look down near the surface, there will be a little bit of a dust swirl kicked up. So that's where it will look. Typically, though, those kind, the funnel doesn't come all the way to the ground. They're a little bit on the weaker side. It's not usual that you get those to be the ef-5 type. Those more often are the big, wide wedge kind of tornadoes like it ultimately was as it came through moore. But the tornadoes go through cycles. Sometimes they begin narrow, get very wide and then rope out and get very narrow again at the very end of their lifetime. 
>> The ropy part is the scariest part. When we were kids, "wizard of oz," that is the scariest. Let me ask you about the weather conditions that create this. Can you predict given certain climates, not climates but different weather fronts hitting each other between the appalachian mountains or whatever, rather the rocky mountains and the mississippi river? Can you predict one of these with any accuracy? 
>> Reporter: Yes. These kind of big outbreaks like this one were foreseen for days in advance. Not the exact location of where they'll hit, but the gal area of central oklahoma was known days in advance to be the prime threat day there on monday. What happened was big upper air disturbance, cold pocket aloft, up 20,000 feet, 30,000 feet in the air came eat. The gulf of mexico moisture was getting stronger and stronger coming to the south. The meeting up and overlapping of the two kinds of air masses made for the vulnerable conditions that allowed explosive thunderstorms and ones that rotate and produce long-lived destructive tornadoes. 
[00:31:24]



>> Without getting into the politics of it, we have a different climate, it seems. We had a tornado hit western massachusetts. We've had very strange, in fact, scary weather. Unpredictable, out of season. You know, used to be you got snow in the winter and the weather changed gradually until june then it got really hot here in july in washington then even hotter in july, a little less hot in august. There was a predictability of the weather we grew up with. Can you say it's called tornado alley with any accuracy and say you're safe somewhere else? 
>> Reporter: Certainly what we've learned in research over the years is that what has traditionally been called tornado alley, the north texas/oklahoma/kansas/nebraska/ iowa area has been a little bit overdone. There is also an extension of that that has sometimes been called dixie alley across the gulf coast states. In 2011, those were extremely active with alabama in april 2011 seeing such a devastating outbreak. So part of the tornado alley now that we realize goes from places like kansas and oklahoma, east texas, then swings all the way over into alabama. Those are where typically the most destructive tornadoes occur. 
>> And this time of year, may, is this the height? Is this predictably the height of the tornado season? 
>> Reporter: In an average year, may is the most active. Somewhat less so in april. Somewhat less so in june. But it does vary somewhat from year to year. Thus the first half of may this year was very, very quiet. Nearly on a record low pace. But obviously now the pace has picked up more toward what we expect in mid to late may. 
>> What do you expect? 
>> Reporter: Well, it certainly looks like the pattern the next few days is going to calm down a little bit relative, slowly, relative to what we have seen these last few days. But given that we are in that prime time now, we've gotten away from the late-season snowstorms that made a lot of the united states so cold that it didn't have the instability. It looks like we're going to be active now from late may into june. 
[00:33:29]



>> We're looking at the pictures, now, right, of the 
-- let me ask you about the personality, it seems, of these things. When you study them 
-- we were using the word monster the other day. People were. They have almost it seems like a personality, these conditions if you want to call them that. 
>> Reporter: Yeah, indeed. These strongest of all tornadoes are, indeed, monsters. They're so wide and have so much power and have thrown so much debris within them that it's not just the wind force. It's the force of all the objects that are being thrown and those are hitting the next house down and adding even more force to it. These strongest of tornadoes, ordinary homes are no match for them. The only really safe place to be in the core of this tornado was underground storm shelters. Fortunately there were a number of those including the home we're at right now. 
>> Yeah, we were with a family that survived because of that. Again, the question of climate. And climate change. Is there something that you see happening? It could be caused by all kinds of forces, but is there a cliic aspect to this? It's not just seasonal or that kind of thing? Is there a cycle going on now? A trend going on? How would you describe it if there is one? 
>> Reporter: The jury, so to speak, is out a little bit in terms of the climate relationship to tornadoes. My own thinking is that as the atmosphere is slowly warming, that has allowed in the cool months warm air to get farther north. We've seen over the past decade or so a lot of tornadoes at more northern latitudes in the middle of the winter months that in the past we were having snowstorms. So that is my own take that we can have tornadoes in bigger parts of the country year-round. There's been some computer model research that suggests that for the core of the spring and summer that the kind of wind shear, the strong winds aloft, actually will be decreasing over the decades and that might actually reduce the tornado threat a little bit in primetime. May, late april, may/june months or perhaps shift it a little bit farther north than it typically has been.

>> I think I can't ever get over the idea of a tornado in western massachusetts. Up where I went to college. The idea of a tornado in massachusetts is just unnormal to me. Anyway, dr. Greg forbes, thank you so much for your expertise at this time. Our coverage of the massive devastation from yesterday's tornado will continue after this. And what were you looking at 
-- you're looking at right now is a time lapse video of yesterday's tornado. There it is. We're getting the full pictures. It rips through moore, oklahoma, with wind speeds now clocked at over 200 miles an hour. The tornado was at one point three miles at its widest. Covered nearly 20 miles in a span of just 40 minutes.

>> Welcome back to "hardball." When a tornado hit, of course, you think people would run away from the danger. These guys run toward it. Storm chasers. Analyze, document and help forecast superstorms up close and personal. Some play hosts to tornado tourists, might sound crazy, but people pay to ride along with the guys and get up close to nature. chris McBee with rapid rotation storm tours. He joins us from moore, oklahoma. You might know simon brewer from the weather channel series "storm riders," he's actively chasing these tornadoes right now and joins us on the phone. Let's start withchris. This turns out to be a big one. Ef-5. Tell me how that differs when you get up to 200 miles an hour, what that's capable of doing to property, human, animal life, whatever? Buildings? 
>> Just as you can see, it's just utter destruction everywhere you look. There are houses completely ripped off their foundations. It's an awful scene here, as you can plainly see. When you get up into the ef-5 range, that's incredible damage. That's how they categorize that. And it's just awful, as is obvious on the ground here in moore. 
>> We're looking at kind of a snaking, it's a little bit wider than a snaking twitter. It's one of those that sort of to me is iconic. An iconic twister. How close can you get to watching that when you take people to go look at it and hopefully are safe when they do it? 
>> Well, we do everything safely. My storm tour company. A tornado that large, we would not get very close to with a tour company 
-- with, I'm sorry, with a tour group just because it's just not safe to have people just in the line of fire like that. We did what we could to help in the aftermath. When you deal with tornadoes this large, it's 
-- like I said, it's just incredible devastation. 
>> What were you able to do to help people yesterday? 
>> Well, we were in a 15-passenger van and came down here to the movie theater which is just down here. And they had a triage unit set up. We asked if we could help with anything. We actually transported some people out of there that needed to get out of town that had lost their cars in the tornado. We were able to help some people get out of the danger zone. 
[00:42:18]



>> So going to the movies, apparently "star trek" was playing, the new one. They were huddled apparently in a corridor among the various movie screens. And they got through it. And then they come outside and what happened? Their cars were gone. 
>> Yeah. Yeah. I think that happened to a lot of people. Were just enjoying a normal day and then this utter destruction just comes through. 
>> Let me go to mr. Brewer. Let me ask you about this. When you're chasing these cells right now, are they now? What kind of dangers are we facing still in the oklahoma area, somewhere in tornado alley? 
>> Oklahoma is okay, but we're on some pretty big storms in northeastern texas. And we just drove through one near mt. Pleasant, texas. And it was really blasting some strong wind. Saw a lot of tree limbs go down. Some some cars having a lot of trouble driving. Got some hail. There is a chance you can have tornadoes along the edge of this line. 
>> Are we at the beginning, the middle or the end of the tornado season, historically? Simon? 
>> Historically we're really at the peak of the tornado season. This year has been a little what you call slow as far as tornadoes are concerned. But some large hail patterns got together and now we're in a very active pattern. 
>> Again, to you, I asked this earlier. What is 
-- is there any difference between what we're watching now and what we would have watched 30 years ago in terms of the climate? The climate aspect? Is there a climatic 
-- without getting, again, into the politics, is there a warming situation we're facing that makes more likely to have tornadoes or any way it's influencing these weather conditions? The climate? The heat? 
>> Well, as far as tornadoes are concerned, climate really doesn't pay any attention to tornadoes. I mean, tornadoes are such a small-scale event. Now, as far as tornado description, you can make some arguments that maybe tornado description would be shifting a little further north. The same things that come together to make tornadoes aren't the same things that come together to make large-scale effects like droughts and flooding events. Tornadoes are on such a smaller scale than that. 
[00:44:29]



>> LET ME GO BACK TO chris McBee and storm chasing. Tell me about what you do? I mean, I'm always fascinated by how people make a living in this country, and all seriousness, tell me about the kinds of people that want to be tourists, if you will, who really are fascinated with this weather condition known as a tornado. 
>> Yeah, tornadoes are big news, obviously. This is just wall-to-wall news about tornadoes. But they're very interesting to people in all walks of life. We have people from other countries coming to tour and see the tornadoes with us as well. You know, these people just are 
-- they're weather enthuse wrasts. They want to learn more about it and be a part of it. We try to help them achieve that. 
>> So they come in may? When do they come? Is it like selling christmas trees? Essentially you better sell them at christmastime? I'm dead serious. It's something I don't know about. Do they come and you tell them to come in may? That's a good season to possibly experience a historic tornado if that's what you're looking for? 
>> Well, I mean, we offer, you know, tours between april and june. So, yes, there's a certain time of theear that is more favorable and we're right in the middle of that right now. And these kind of things happen. 
>> Give me a distribution of where around the world people come from to see this thing. 
>> We've had a lot of interest from the uk and australia mainly. Some interest from germany and some other european countries as well. 
>> What's it cost? 2,800 for a week. About $300 a day. You know, we offer daily and weekly tours. But, yeah, I mean 
-- 
>> fascinating. Because I'm fascinated now. I guess I can imagine people building a, you know, not a hobby, that's lighthearted, but fascinated by the power of nature. When you're with them and giving them the tour, what do you tell them about this power that they're looking at? This nature at its worst? 
[00:46:33]



>> Really when we're up close and personal with the storms, nature kind of speaks for itself. We'll explain what's going on, explain the weather situation and show them all our equipment. But the tornadoes can really speak for themselves which is with their power and just really mother nature at its worst.

>>> Welcome back to "hardball" "time" magazine's jane newton small has been on the ground. She's talked to the people of moore, oklahoma, who've seen their homes destroyed and saved their own neighbor's lives. The new issue of "time" magazine is dedicated to devastating tornado itself. We don't have jane yet. This has been an amazing experience for us up north to cover an area of the country I've never been to, oklahoma. I think it's the only state I've never been to. It's got an incredible history of weather. The dust bowl changed so much of AMERICAN HISTORY IN THE 1930s. "Grapes of wrath" is all about the weather conditions down there and what it caused to the agriculture and killing of kag culture for a long period of time in the dust bowl. This one an ef-5 which is the worst of the hurricanes you can face. Only matching up to one they had earlier back in 1999. So it's clearly in that same area that we call tornado alley going through the same city, the same suburb of 40,000-some people in moore, oklahoma. There it is, we're looking at now, hit again with the same kind of damage. Lucky, the pictures you're seeing are not represented by that many deaths or injuries. The devastation is physical. As I said, it looks like a neutron bomb blowing away homes, blowing away cars. You're at the movie theater, you come out from the movie theater, you're still alive. Your car has disappeared into the 300-mile-an-hour wind. In this incredible situation where people got a warning and acted on it. Most of the people got out of there. They got away. Got in their cars and moved on. Or they had real shelter like the corales family that had the little refrigerator like shelter. We saw how they were able to save their lives by that emergency decision. We're going to come back and talk about this tomorrow and throughout this evening. Msnbc is committed to covering this story well and in human terms without the politics. I think we're going to do a great job tonight, so stay with msnbc.

Own way realizing that it is our duty as americans to help americans that face disasters that they had nothing to do with, but that we have everything to do with helping them make it through. It could be you. It could be me. It could be our child. Let's help. Thanks for watching. I'm al sharpton. Chris jansing continues our coverage of the oklahoma tornadoes, next. 
>>> Good evening. I'm chris matthews in washington. Rescue efforts in the oklahoma city suburb of moore are still under way. More than 24 hours after a devastating tornado ripped through the region. Here's what we know right now. At least 24 people were killed. That number includes at least nine children. Seven of whom died at an elementary school stuck in the storm's path. Nearly 240 others were injured. Both those numbers could obviously go up in the coming days. Throughout the community, homes were blown away. Schools and hospitals were demolished. Neighbors lie in ruin as you can see here. The weather today, with heavy rain and lightning, slowed the rescue effort, but more than 100 people have been pulled from the rubble just so far. Meanwhile, the national weather service upgraded the storm to an ef-5, that's the strongest rating for a tornado. Ef-5. The president declared a major disaster area in oklahoma today. He spoke from the white house earlier. 
>> The people of moore should know that their country will remain on the ground there for them, beside them, as long as it takes. For there are homes and schools to rebuild. Businesses and hospitals to reopen. There are parents to console. First responders to comfort. And, of course, frightened children who will need our continued love and attention. 
[00:02:04]



>> Well, the president also reached out to oklahoma governor mary fallin. This afternoon the governor, herself, spoke about the unbelievable tragedy in oklahoma. 
>> It's been a very trying couple of days for the state of oklahoma. It's a sad time for us because we've experienced one of our most horrific storms and disasters that the state has ever faced. But yet in the midst of tragedy and loss of life, we've also seen the resilience and the courage and the strength of our people, and we will get through this. We will overcome and we will rebuild and we will regain our strength. 
>> Meanwhile, there's potential for more severe weather this evening in northern texas, arkansas, and parts of louisiana and oklahoma. Msnbc's chris jansing has been on the ground in moore, oklahoma, all this day. She joins us now. Thank you so much, chris, my colleague. What is it like down there? I just want to get a sense that we can't see on the tv. 
>> Reporter: It's hard. Really to put into words, chris. As I drove in here, it almost didn't really 
-- it seemed like it was the set of a movie. It wasn't possible. I had never seen, and people who cover storms had never seen destruction like this. This is what happens with 200 mile per hour winds. Entire neighborhoods wiped out. I mean, there you see some folks who are just going through the painstaking work of looking at what's left of their house which isn't much. Some people just trying to find usually things that are sentimental to them, like photographs or pieces of jewelry. But it just goes on for block after block after block. We heard stories of horses 
-- there's a lot of farmland around here. Horses flying in the air. We see piles of cars across the street in the parking lot. Five, six deep. There's even a car on top of the medical center across the street. The devastation is almost unbelievable. They are still doing the painstaking work of going through the rubble. They don't believe, chris, at this point that there are any people trapped, but they don't want to rule out the possibility and they're getting calls. They got a call just a few minutes ago. We were listening on the radio of people who think they hear or see something. In this case, it was at one of the storm shelters, and so they sent people over to check it out. So this is going to be an ongoing process here. Obviously, the first thing they're doing is making sure there isn't anybody trapped. Beyond that, to even assess the damage and then start to think about rebuilding, chris. 
[00:04:34]



>> You know, it looked like a neutron bomb hit. You've heard about neutron bombs in the old days. I'm sure they still exist where they bomb the buildings, they don't necessarily kill the people through contamination. People, we've watched all these pictures 
-- we haven't seen. We've seen live horses. We haven't seen dead horses. We've heard about casualties. We certainly have them by the hundreds now. We haven't seen them on the ground. Did a lot of people just basically get the word and get out of there? 
>> Reporter: Well, one of the things that happened, chris, was this happened during the day and a lot of times this happens at night and people are asleep in their beds. Even though there was only 16 minutes' warning, people had an idea that it was coming. And they were able, you know, to get to their shelters or get into a basement. We're just down the street from a movie theater, and people who were in there watching a movie described that all of a sudden all the phones started to light up. It was a weather warning that people were getting on their phones so they all were moved out into a hallway. They were up against the wall. And when they walked out of that movie theater, which by the way is still standing, everything else they saw around them was pretty much gone. So that's what it was like, but I think they do believe that the fact that it happened during the day, and one more thing, chris, I think this is important, you know, this storm hit this town, this suburb of oklahoma city almost exactly the same way that it hit in 1999. And the folks who were here in 1999 will tell you they offered them the opportunity to get some help to build storm shelters, and a lot of people did. And the mayor told me this morning that he thinks if that help wasn't available and so many people hadn't built storm shelters that the devastation and the loss of life could have been much, much worse. 
>> We've heard so much from the local people, and it's got to be authoritative, because there are lives at stake, that the ground is too hard to get through, that the water table is too high. What is the safe place 
-- is there a known structure or a known, I guess, a basement? What is a safe place to reliably wait out one of these tornadoes when you know an ef-5 is coming your way? Is there a safe place for sure? 
[00:06:40]



>> Reporter: There are storm shelters. There are storm shelters, and people went there. Is any place safe absolutely for sure? People will tell you it's not. But the other thing that folks here will tell you, because you ask them, well, if you were here in 1999 and are still here again, will you stay? Everybody I talked to said they would. This isomething you're brought up with and you learn and you drill it in school and many parents talk to their kids about it. And it almost instinctively when I talk to some people, one guy was across the street and decided he had to get home. Instinctively he knew what closet he was going to go to and everything fell around him and he was okay. 
>> Wow. 
>> Reporter: So is anything 100% safe? No. But there are storm shelters. People have built their own storm shelters. And they do know where to go. And there are procedures. Because if you think, chris, of a multiplex movie theater and the people that we talk to, they got into the hall and everybody seemed to be pretty organized. Nobody talked about it being chaotic. That's pretty remarkable. I think it speaks to the fact that this is a place where tornadoes happen and people know what to do. 
>> You mentioned schools. Tell me what we know about plaza towers. Last night we got a report, fortunately it wasn't accurate, of 24 kids being killed. A local news report apparently was being passed around by authorities. It turns out it was less than that. But the fact that they chose, the teachers, as the smart move, the safest move was to keep the kids in a stronger structure at a school building, get them against a wall in the safest part of the building and hope for the best. What do we know about what happened following that procedure? 
>> Reporter: Well, let me tell you. One of the things that gave me chills, and there are always stories of heroism that come out of these tragedies, chris. One of the stories is of a teacher who got her kids to the safe place and then worried that the roof was going to come off, and, in fact, the ceiling did collapse. Had them all go down and she put her arms around them and covered their heads. One of the fathers said that he has absolutely no doubt she saved the lives of her young students that day. She is hospitalized. He said that the storm was so powerful it actually pulled eye glasses off of the kids. But there she was taking care of them. Another teacher who was at a preschool and the kids were understandably very upset. Some of them were crying and some of them were yelling. And she had taught them this song "you are my sunshine" and got them all singing the song so they would stay calm and nobody would try to run away and they would all be safe. I think that's just more of the remarkable stories. It reminded me so much of newtown and the heroism of teachers and how under the most stressful circumstances they seem instinctively, and I'm sure through training obviously as well, they know what to do. 
[00:09:27]



>> So do you, chris jansing. Thanks for that great reporting. It's great to have you on the ground when something good or bad happens. Thanks for being here. Nbc's savannah guthrie spoke with rhonda crosswit. That's a teacher of plaza towers, an elementary school that chris jansing mentioned. Crosswhite protected her students as we heard from chris by lying on top of them and comforting with them throughout the deal. Crosswhite reunited with one of those students during her interview with savannah. Here it is. 
>> I was in a stall with some kids. It started coming down. I laid on top of them. One of my little boys said, i love you, I love you, please don't die with me. Please don't die with me. I never thought I was going to die. The whole time I just kept screaming to them, quit worrying, we're fine, we're fine, we're fine, we're fine. 
>> Reporter: I do have a student here who wants to say thank you to you. This is damian klein. And his mom, brandy. 
>> I told you we were going to be okay. 
>> Alfredo corales, maria and vivian luna survived yesterday in their storm shelter. Thank you. Tell us your decision to build a storm shelter. What works or doesn't in these ef-5 tornadoes? 
>> The only thing I can say about the storm cellars, that's the only way to go especially when you have a tornado this big. You know, the news, the weathermen tell you all the time if it's that big, if you're above ground, you're not going to survive it. So, I mean, really the only thing I can tell people is that, you know, the seriousness of having a storm cellar is at a ten. 
>> And people have told me in the last 24 hours that it's hard to build because the ground is so hard down there. Is it expensive or difficult to put a shelter in? To dig it in the ground? 
>> You know, I mean, the clay here, it's red clay so the clay is 
-- the dirt is hard. Expensive-wise, honestly, i mean, it's probably a few thousand dollars. 
[00:11:34]



>> Yeah. 5,000 or $6,000 the last i knew. 
>> And let me ask maria luna, your wife, about how you managed to get the whole family to the shelter in time to avoid horror. 
>> Well, to be honest with you, I was at work when all this happened. It was alfredo and actually vivi, my daughter, that was there by herself at the house. And th alfredo got home. He's the one who got 
-- told her to go into the shelter because a tornado was close. But me being at work, I was really worried because there were no cell phone lines. There was no communication. I couldn't get ahold of them. So I was really worried about them. 
>> Viviana, you just survived one of the biggest tornadoes ever to hit your area. What are you going to be able to tell people what it was like, how you got the warning, how much time you had? What it was like racing to the shelter? 
>> This is something that is honestly unexplainable. I can't even begin to tell you how I feel or how I felt during this whole experience. There wasn't much time between getting from my house to the shelter just because the tornado was already so close. I'm just still in shock as of everything that's been happening. 
>> How much warning did you get? 
>> I got maybe about five or ten minutes' warning, then once alfredo got home, he told me to get my butt in the shelter and that's exactly what I did. 
>> Alfredo, how much time did you have to get your daughter, or get this whole thing organized? 
>> You know, we actually, you know, we listened to the news the day before, you know. They had the big tornadoes that hit shawnee. And the weathermen basically told us that we were going to have the same type of outbreak the next day. So we were already kind of a little bit warned on that part of it. So we kind of knew when the outbreak was going to kind of form and start up and we just, you know, I was at my office with a few of my business partners, and we just got on our laptops, pulled up the radar to kind of see where things were going. They were just getting really bad so we made the executive decision to go to my house where we have the storm cellar. It was probably, you know, from getting there to the house, we probably 
-- to orchestrate it all, we probably had less than five minutes at the most. 
[00:14:06]



>> Good work. Good work for you. Congratulations. I shouldn't say that because it's still a horror for the community, but you did the right thing. Alfredo, thank you.

>>> I heard the roar of the tornado. And then I grabbed my dog and we went and laid down in the closet. Saw the glass breaking, things crashing and rumbling. And then the ceiling, the roof tore off. And I could see little holes starting to develop in the ceiling. And I could actually see the tornado. 
>> Boy, that's a good account there. Welcome back to "hardball." Local, state and federal officials have been out in full force responding to the disaster left by yesterday's tornado. Let's go back to moore, oklahoma, where lieutenant governor todd lamb is there. He joins us tonight. Welcome, lieutenant governor 
-- rather, governor, thank you for joining us. Give us a sense in your authority position right now, what's getting done, what you need from fema, how things stand in terms of dealing with this incredible disaster? 
>> Chris, it's absolutely horrific. To see the images on the television, it pales in comparison to real life. The devastation is horrific. I was with the governor yesterday. We went to the emergency operation center. When spoke to the president, she also made the request to fema. Everything that's been requested by the state of oklahoma to the federal authority, to the president and to fema, every request has been granted and we're receiving federal assistant at this time. 
>> So how does it work now, just so we'd like to get a sense, i would, of how it works. You call washington, you call craig fugate, head of fema. How does it work state to government, in these kind of catastrophes? 
>> Yesterday, shortly after the tornado completed its devastation in moore, oklahoma, governor fallin called the regional director of fema with our emergency management director, albert ashwood. They went through a formal procedure of requesting federal assistance for the four counties that were affected from the tornadoes the day before and the tornado here in moore yesterday. That was the semantics of going through the process. That would allow us in oklahoma, in any state for that matter, that goes through the process to begin removing the regulation to hire contracts, contract workers, and remove the competitive bid process to seek relief on a quicker basis for emergencies such as this. 
[00:19:55]



>> I've gotten an education on what you do in these situations and how devastating it can be. Up around the new york city area in breezy point, places like staten island and the rockaways where all the electricity is blown away. You have people's homes electrical systems are blown away, where the houses are declared basically unlivable and you have to deal with almost a rock bottom situation where whole communities have to be rebuilt, especially the electrical systems, sewer systems, water systems. How do you do the triage in the next couple months, in fact, the next couple of days? 
>> Well, it's the assessment process. You hit the nail on the head, chris. It's one thing to go through the rescue efforts we're going through right now and the recovery efforts we're going through right now. The cleanup we're going through right now. But I've talked to many people and they ask me, what are my thoughts? Well, don't forget oklahoma in three days. Don't forget oklahoma in one week. Don't forget oklahoma in three weeks. Moore, oklahoma, where we are, you've said it mantimes, i know already, on your program. This is the third time we've had this go through moore. 1999, 2003, and yesterday. We will rebuild. We're a strong people. We're a people of faith and a people of hope. But it's going to be a long process to go through the rescue, recovery and cleanup. As you said, power's out. Electricity is down. There are water issues right now. There's a long road ahead of us, but we will overcome once again. 
>> You know, we were just talking to a family whose lives were saved by being in a shelter. It didn't look like a very expensive shelter. A couple of thousand dollars. Alfredo corrales told us his personal family shelter. Is that something that should be part of the rebuilding? The building of 
-- I know the ground down there is tough. There's a water level problem. But is there a possibility we can 
-- you can't ensure against this kind of disaster. But is there any way to prepare better than it's been prepared? Without casting any blame, of course, in the future. 
>> No, I understand your question. I think it's a fair question and appropriate question whenever you see devastation of this magnitude. Particularly, as I've said, to the exponential number of three. I have a great relationship with congressman tom cole. I know you have a relationship with congressman tom cole. 
[00:22:06]



>> He's good. 
>> I've known him for over two decades. He's a great statesman. And we're in his district right now. He's got boots on the ground, it's my understanding he's already arrived from washington. He's taking a tour right now with the governor. And I'll defer to congressman cole with any legislation he sponsors on capitol hill and what he thinks is bestor his district that has been so devastated yesterday. 
>> I was just thinking maybe tax breaks for people or any kind of subsidy because we're all in this together. Maybe it's a good thing to encourage people to do the kind of thing the corrales family did. I don't know. I don't live there. Let me ask you about living in that part of the country. This sort of god be with us situation where you know you really can't save your life. It depends on the luck of the draw, in a sense. I've been hearing in the last 24 hours that sometimes you can be on the same street and one house will get blown away and one won't. What are the vagaries of these tornados. They're not homogenous the way they cut through the ground. They seem to cut irregularly. You can't figure them out. What's your experience in that regard? 
>> The term "freak of nature" applies no better than to the force of a tornado. I passed as I was coming down to moore this morning about 5:50 a.M., I passed by a shopping center. About four or five stores long. The bookend stores almost completely en 
-- intact. But the store in the very middle hollowed out. And the storm actually passed north to south over the mall. So my point is, they're a freak of nature. You hear about straws of hay going through stockade fences. That happens. There was a window knocked out. Two tornadoes 
-- excuse me, two days ago in a tornado. The window was knocked out in the shape of a heart in one of our hospitals in north oklahoma city in the edmond area. They're freaks of nature. You never know what they're going to do and how they're going to impact a structure or a community. 
>> As a lifelong movie buff, i was happy to know, I mean this in all seriousness, they had an organized system at one of those cineplexes down there in that area. They were able to get the people in one of the most strongest part of the movie structure. The cineplex structure. They got them in the hallway. Everything was done in an organized regular, really gutsy way and it worked. The people made it. 
[00:24:17]



>> It did work, and I'm 
-- chris, as I'm looking at the camera, that is just 
-- I'm looking right now at the theater of which you speak to show you how close it is to where we are standing. I know a father and a son who was going to see "star trek" yesterday afternoon and they hunkered down in that hallway and it was a horrific time is what the father said. 
>> And they got through it. 
>> They got through it. They survived and they got through it. 
>> Governor, it's great to talk to you. Lieutenant governor todd lamb of oklahoma. Hold in there, sir. 
>>> For oklahomans affected by the tornado, relief torsions 
-- organizations are already on hand to help tonight. If you'd like to help, I'm sure you're thinking about it, here's the number. You can't forget this one. 1-800-red-cross. 1-800-red-cross.

>>> Welcome back to "hardball." The tornado that hit oklahoma yesterday was remarkable for its size, strength and the devastation it left behind as you can see. What were the conditions that called us to create such a monster funnel? Look at it there. Oh. Look at it. Well, it hit the town of moore, oklahoma. It hit so hard and so often. What caused all that. Joining me now is an expert. The weather channel's dr. Greg forbes. Dr. Forbes, thank you for being with us tonight. You know, we always like to understand nature because maybe in some part of our brain we ning think, or our soul, we hope we can have some impact of protecting ourselves and understanding what god's plan is, if you will. This tornado went to an ef-5. What does that tell you? Is this really the peak of what a tornado can be? 
>> Yeah. The enhanced fujita scale, ef goes from 0 to 5. 5 is the highest. That means it had wind gusts at least at one location in excess of 200 miles an hour. 
>> When I'm looking at it, there it is, this is frightening. It's getting wide. It's getting wider. It starts as kind of a winding snake. First a fragmented snake then a complete snake. Then this winding funnel. Then apparently it widens to up to two miles. What is 
-- that didn't touch ground, would there be any devastation? Does it have to actually get to the ground visibly to cause the destruction? 
>> Sometimes for the very narrowest of tornadoes, the funnel coming down from the cloud will remain there. But if you look down near the surface, there will be a little bit of a dust swirl kicked up. So that's where it will look. Typically, though, those kind, the funnel doesn't come all the way to the ground. They're a little bit on the weaker side. It's not usual that you get those to be the ef-5 type. Those more often are the big, wide wedge kind of tornadoes like it ultimately was as it came through moore. But the tornadoes go through cycles. Sometimes they begin narrow, get very wide and then rope out and get very narrow again at the very end of their lifetime. 
>> The ropy part is the scariest part. When we were kids, "wizard of oz," that is the scariest. Let me ask you about the weather conditions that eate this. Can you predict given certain climates 
-- not climates, but different weather fronts hitting each other between the appalachian mountains or whatever, rather rocky mountains and the mississippi river? Can you predict one of these with any accuracy? 
[00:30:58]



>> Yes. These kind of big outbreaks like this one were foreseen for days in advance. Not the exact location of where they'll hit, but the general area of central oklahoma was known days in advance to be the prime threat day there on monday. What happened was a big upper air disturbance, cold pocket aloft up 20,000 feet, 30,000 feet in the atmosphere, came east. At the same time the gulf of mexico moisture was getting stronger and stronger coming in from the south. The meeting up and overlapping of the two kinds of air masses made for the vulnerable conditions that allowed explosive thunderstorms and ones that rotate and produce long-lived destructive tornadoes. 
>> Without getting into the politics of it, we have a different climate, it seems. We had a tornado hit western massachusetts. We've had very strange, in fact, scary weather. Unpredictable, out of season. You know, used to be you got snow in the winter and the weather changed gradually until june. Then it got real hot here in july in washington. Then even hotter in july, a little less hot in august. There was a predictability of the weather we grew up with. Is it becoming less predictable? Can you say it's called tornado alley with any accuracy and say you're safe somewhere else? 
>> , Certainly what we've learned in research over the years is that what has traditionally been called tornado alley, the north texas, oklahoma, kansas, nebraska, iowa area has been a little bit overdone. There is also an extension of that that has sometimes been called dixie alley across the gulf coast states. In 2011, those were extremely active with alabama in april 2011 seeing such a devastating outbreak. So part of the tornado alley now that we realize goes from places like kansas and oklahoma, east texas, then swings all the way over into alabama. Those are where typically the most destructive tornadoes occur. 
>> And this time of year, may, is this the height? Is this predictably the height of the tornado season? 
>> In an average year, may is the most active. Somewhat less so in april. Somewhat less so in june. But it does vary somewhat from year to year. Thus the first half of may this year was very, very quiet. Nearly on a record low pace. But obviously now the pace has picked up more toward what we expect in mid to late may. 
[00:33:13]



>> What do you expect? 
>> Well, it certainly looks like the pattern the next few days is going to calm down a little bit relative 
-- slowly, relative to what we have seen these last few days. But given that we are in that prime time now, we've gotten away from those late season snowstorms that made a lot of the united states so cold that it didn't have the instability. It looks like we're going to be pretty active now from late may into june. 
>> It's behind him. We're looking at the pictures right now of the 
-- let me ask you about the personality, it seems, of these things. When you study them 
-- we were using the word "monster" the other day. People were. They have almost it seems like a personality, these conditions, if you want to call them that. 
>> Yeah. Indeed 
-- the strongest of all tornadoes are, indeed, monsters. They're so wide and have so much power and have thrown so much debris within them that it's not just the wind force. It's the force of all the objects that are being thrown and those are hitting the next house down and adding even more force to it. These strongest of tornadoes, ordinary homes are no match for them. The only really safe place to be in the core of this moore tornado was underground storm shelters. And fortunately there were a yumpl those. Including the home we're at right now. 
>> Yeah. We were a family, the corrales family that survived because of that. Again, the question of climate. And climate change. Is there something that you see happening? It could be caused by all kinds of forces, but is there a climatic aspect to this? It's not just seasonal or that kind of thing? Is there a cycle going on now? A trend going on? How would you describe it if there is one? 
>> The jury, so to speak, is out a little bit in terms of the climate relationship to tornadoes. My own thinking is that as the atmosphere is slowly warming, that has allowed in the cool months warm air to get farther north. We've seen over the past decade or so a lot of tornadoes at more northern latitudes in the middle of the winter months that in the past we were having snowstorms. So that is my own take that we can have tornadoes in bigger parts of the country year-round. There's been some computer model research that suggests that for the core of the spring and summer that the kind of wind shear, the strong winds aloft, actually will be decreasing over the decades and that might actually reduce the tornado threat a little bit in primetime. May, late april, may/june months or perhaps shift it a little bit farther north than it typically has been. 
[00:35:50]



>> I think I can't ever get over the idea of a tornado in western massachusetts. Up where I went to college. The idea of a tornado in massachusetts is just unnormal to me. Anyway, dr. Greg forbes, thank you so much for your expertise at this time. Our coverage of the massive devastation from yesterday's tornado will continue after this. And what were you looking at 
-- what you're looking at right now is a time lapse video of yesterday's tornado. There it is. We're getting the full pictures. It rips through moore, oklahoma, with wind speeds now clocked at over 200 miles an hour. The tornado was at one point three miles at its widest. Covered nearly 20 miles in a span of just 40 minutes. Look at this. performer. I'm also a survivor of ovarian and uterine cancers. I even wrote a play about that. My symptoms were a pain in my abdomen and periods that were heavier and longer than usual for me. If you have symptoms that last two weeks or longer, be brave, go to the doctor. Ovarian and uterine cancers are gynecologic cancers. Symptoms are not the same for everyone. I got sick...and then I got better. 
[00:39:52]



>>> I was able to find pictures which everything else is pointless. 
>> I got out here after it passed, and I just fell to my knees. That's all 
-- all I could do. Me and my fiancee, everything we own was in the trailer. And this is all we got left. 
>> Welcome back to "hardball." When a tornado hits, of course, you think people would run away from the danger. These guys, they run towards it. We're talking about storm chasers. They document, analyze, help forecast superstorms up close and personal. Some play hosts to tornado tourists, might sound crazy, but people pay to ride along with the guys and get up close to nature at its worst. chris McBee is co-owner of rapid rotation storm tours. He joins us from moore, oklahoma. You might know simon brewer from the weather channel series "storm riders," he's actively chasing these tornadoes right now and joins us on the phone. Let's start with chris. This one turns out to be one of the big ones. Ef-5. Tell me how that differs from 
-- when you get up to 200 les an hour, what that's capable of doing to property, human, animal, life, whatever, buildings. 
>> Just as you can see, it's just utter destruction everywhere you look. There are houses completely ripped off their foundations. It's an awful scene here, as you can plainly see. When you get up into the ef-5 range, that's incredible damage. That's how they categorize that. And it's just awful, as is obvious on the ground here in moore. 
>> We're looking at kind of a snaking, it's a little bit wider than a snaking twister. It's one of those that sort of to me is iconic. An iconic twister. How close can you get to watching that when you take people to go look at it and hopefully are safe when they do it? 
>> Well, we do everything safely, my storm tour company. A tornado that large, we would not get very close to with a tour company 
-- with, I'm sorry, with a tour group just because it's just not safe to have people just in the line ofe like that. We would certainly view it from a far distance. Then do what we could to help, you know, in the aftermath. When you deal with tornadoes this large, it's 
-- like I said, it's just incredible devastation. 
[00:42:08]



>> What were you able to do to help people yesterday? 
>> Well, we were in a 15-passenger van and came down here to the movie theater which is just down here. And they had a triage unit set up. We asked if we could help with anything. We actually transported some people out of there that needed to get out of town that had lost their cars in the tornado. We were able to help some people get out of the danger zone. 
>> So going to the movies, apparently "star trek" was playing, the new one. They were huddled apparently in a corridor among the various movie screens. And they got through it. And then they come outside and what happened? Their cars were gone. 
>> Yeah. Yeah. I think that happened to a lot of people. That were just enjoying a normal day. Then this utter destruction just comes through. 
>> Let me go to mr. Brewer. Let me ask you about this. When you're chasing these cells right now, where are they now? What kind of dangers are we facing still in the oklahoma area, somewhere in tornado alley? 
>> Oklahoma is okay, but we're on some pretty big storms in northeastern texas. And we just drove through one near mt. Pleasant, texas. And it was really blasting some strong wind. Saw a lot of tree limbs go down. Some some cars having a lot of trouble driving. Got some hail. There is a chance you can have tornadoes along the edge of this line. 
>> Are we at the beginning, the middle or the end of the tornado season, historically? Simon? 
>> Historically we're really at the peak of the tornado season. This year has been a little what you would call slow as far as tornadoes are concerned. But some large hail patterns got together and now we're in a very active pattern. 
>> Again, to you, I asked this earlier. What is 
-- is there any difference between what we're watching now and what we would have watched 30 years ago in terms of the climate? The climate aspect? Is there a climatic 
-- without getting, again, into the politics, is there a warming situation we're facing that makes it more likely to have tornadoes or any way it's influencing these weather conditions? The climate? The heat? 
[00:44:14]



>> Well, as far as tornadoes are concerned, climate really doesn't pay any attention to tornadoes. I mean, tornadoes are such a small-scale event. Now, as far as tornado distribution, you can make some arguments that maybe tornado distribution would be shifting a little farther north. But really the same things that come together to make tornadoes aren't really the same things that come together to make large scale effects like droughts and flooding events. Tornadoes are on such a smaller scale than that. 
>> LET ME GO BACK TO chris McBee and storm chasing. Tell me about what you do. I mean, I'm always fascinated by how people make a living in this country, and in all seriousness, tell me about the kinds of people who want to be tourists, if you will. Who are really fascinated with this weather conditions known as a tornado. 
>> Yeah, tornadoes are big news, obviously. This is just wall-to-wall news about tornadoes. But they're very interesting to people in all walks of life. We have people from other countries coming to tour and see the tornadoes with us as well. You know, these people just are 
-- they're weather enthusiasts. They want to look more about it and they want to be a part of it. We try to help them achieve that. 
>> So they come in may? When do they come? Is it like selling christmas trees, in the sense you better sell them at christmas time? I'm dead serious. It's something I don't know ability. You tell them to come in may, that's a good season to possibly experience an historic tornado if that's what you're looking for? 
>> Well, I mean, we offer, you know, tours between april and june. So, yes, there's a certain time of the year that is more favorable and we're right in the middle of that right now. And these kind of things happen. 
>> Give me a distribution of where around the world people come from to see this thing. 
>> We've had a lot of interest from the uk and australia mainly. Some interest from germany and some other european countries as well. 
>> What's it cost? 2,800 for a week. About $300 a day. You know, we offer daily and weekly tours. But, yeah, I mean 
-- 
[00:46:27]



>> fascinating. Because I'm fascinated now. I guess I can imagine people building a, you know, not a hobby, that's lighthearted, but fascinated by the power of nature. And when you're with them and you're giving them the tour, what do you tell them about this power that they're looking at? This nature at its worst? 
>> Really, when we're up close and personal with the storms, nature kind of speaks for itself. We'll explain what's going on, explain the weather situation and show them all our equipment. But the tornadoes can really speak for themselves just with their power, and just really mother nature at its worst.

Men with breast cancer or who have or might have prostate cancer, and women who are or may become pregnant or are breast-feeding, should not use androgel. Serious side effects include worsening of an enlarged prostate, possible increased risk of prostate cancer, lower sperm count, swelling of ankles, feet, or body, enlarged or painful breasts, problems breathing during sleep, and blood clots in the legs.

>>> welcome back to "hardball." "Time" magazine has been on the ground reporting since the tornado struck. She is talked to those that helped save their neighbors. The new issue talks about the devastating tornado yet. This has been an amazing experience who live up north to be able to cover a part of the country I've never been to oklahoma. It's the only state I haven't been to. It's got an incredible history of weather. Let's face it. Think about the dust bowl that changed so much of american HISTORY IN THE 1930s. The grapes of wrath. It's about the weather conditions down there and what it caused to the agriculture and killing of the agriculture for a long period of time in the dust bowl and now this history of tornadoes competitive. This one an ef-5 which is the worst of the hurricanes you can face only matching up to one we had earlier in 1999. It's the same area of tornado alley going through the same city, the same suburb of 40,000 people and now we are looking at it hit again with the same kind of damage. Luckily the pictures you're seeing are not representative by that many deaths or injuries. The devastation is physical. Almost like a newtron bomb blowing away homes. Blowing away cars at the movie theater you come out and you're still alive, your car has disappeared into the 300-mile-an-hour wind. Incredible situation where people really did get a warning and they acted on it. Those people, most of the people got out of there. They got away. They got in their cars and moved on or had shelter.

>> She spoke before the jury for 19 minutes. 
>> To this day I cannot believe I am capable of this kind of violence. She played a slide show for the jury showing her in happier times.

>>> Deborah: Yesterday we aired an interview with o.J. Simpson's ex-girlfriend christie prody. She was shocked how much weight he has gained behind bars. She believes simpson was obsessed with his slain ex-wife nicole, even trying to mold christie into a nicole brown simpson look alive. 
>> Was o.J. Simpson obsessed with his dead ex-wife nicole brown simpson. 
[00:18:02]



>> It was hard to deal with that everyday and, you know, comparing me, comparing me to nicole, nicole did this, nicole did that. You should do this. 
>> Christie prody tells "inside edition" that he talked about his murdered ex-wife each and everyday during their 12 year long relationship. I think he did snap. I think he was obsessed with nicole because he is still obsessed with her. The 12 years I was with him 
-- 
>> she said simpson tried to make her look more like nicole. When she first met simpson, she was a natural brunette. He encouraged her to dye her hair blond. 
>> He was try to fix my hair, part it to a certain side and comb it down and he would make comments like this is how nicole wore her hair. I got so sick of it. 
>> Christie ended up bearing a striking resemblance to simpson's ex-wife. It's like vertigo, the hitchcock film when he tries to make his new girlfriend look like his dead one. Christie was just 21 when she met 46- year-old simpson. 
>> I was young. He kept trying to shape me, mold me into what he wanted. 
>> She said simpson actually started threatening her and she came to fear that she may suffer the same fate as nicole. 
>> He would say things like you better watch out so something bad doesn't happen to you like nicole. 
>> We asked christie if she thought o.J. Murdered his ex-wife. She said after thinking about it for years she says probably more likely that he did than not. O.J. Simpson is waiting for the judge in las vegas to decide if his conviction on kidnapping and armed robbery can be thrown out. When we come back, more incredible images from the disaster in oklahoma.

Arvirus? And my question is, did you guys changehe diet on the dog when got 
-- what diet? Did you change diet when you took him home? Same diet as he was feeding before? 
>> His dog food. 
>> But the same food that he was feeding 
-- same brand? 
>> Dry dog food. Mm-hmm. So, the thing is, judge, you had mentioned something that, you know, showing symptoms and all that. The thing is that either way, like, I mean, that right there would say that he came to us with it, because whether or not he contracted it through fecal matter whatever, or through this vaccine that he supposedly gave to rhino and the other puppies 
-- whether it was through the vaccine and showing kind of symptoms, like, going through that? 
>> Okay, so, no, no, no. Hold on a second. The vaccine shows up in the stool as a positive, but doesn't cause disease. This is the misunderstanding. A live vaccine of parvo, and this is a live vaccine that he gave, can show up as a positive in the stool. You pick up the antigen, because they use antigens, okay? It's a virus that's partially killed but still alive. You vaccinate the dog. The immune system mounts immunity against the vaccine, but these live-vaccine particles start shedding in the feces five days after vaccination lasting up to two weeks. So you come in to test. You pick up this virus which doesn't mean a disease. It's just a vaccine 
-- a live vaccine used in the dog.

>> Judge Brown: Dr. Molnar has been put in the position he has not been put into for 10 years, and that is, he's calling it a draw. I can't tell. So the problem is that you have the burden of proof to prove by the preponderance of the evidence that what you allege is more likely than not. And what I've got is a flat-out tie. I can't say affirmatively, based on the evidence, that the defendant is the entity that's responsible for rhino's problem. I hope you have homeowner's insurance. They should cover this. But this is one of those things where the law is harsh, but the law is the law. 
>> Miss Sonia: This courtroom is now in recess. 
>> Judge Brown: Thank you. 
>> Jeanne: Looked like parvo, tested positive for parvo. Bottom line 
-- it might not have been parvo, according to the expert, and rhino was the only puppy that got sick. Claim denied. We'll be right back. 
>> Jare back. Rhino was sick, and the other puppies were not. That is the fact that turned this case. The expert testified that parvo from the defendant would have attacked the entire litter.

>> Judge Judy: And where do you train dogs? 
>> In the fort lauderdale, florida, area. 
>> Judge Judy: You have a place of business? 
>> I do. I often work in my clients' homes. 
>> Judge Judy: And is that your sole source of income? 
>> Yes, it is. 
>> Judge Judy: How much did you earn last year from that business? 
>> Probably close to $50,000. 
>> Judge Judy: And the year before? 
>> About the same. 
>> Judge Judy: And that's all you've done. That's what you do.30 years. 
>> That's all I . 
>> Judge Judy: Who do you live with, miss tenner? 
>> I live with myself. 
>> Judge Judy: And you, miss wheeler, what do you do? 
>> I am a fleet finance director for an automobile dealership. 
>> Judge Judy: Where? 
>> In fort lauderdale, florida. 
>> Judge Judy: How long have you been doing that? 30-plus years. 
>> Judge Judy: How long in fort lauderdale? 30-plus years. 
>> Judge Judy: I'd like you to tell me about this loan that you allegedly made to your friend. 
>> Suzie moved to south carolina, I believe, in 2011 with her daughter 
-- moved up to her husband. 
>> Judge Judy: So in 2011, she left fort lauderdale and moved to south carolina? 
[00:02:01]



>> Correct. And she was having a very hard time making a living up there. We were very good friends. We spoke on the phone often, and she was having a very difficult time. 
>> Judge Judy: How long have you known her? 
>> Probably close to 30 years. 
>> Judge Judy: Go ahead. 
>> I felt very badly for her. I knew she was very talented. I knew she had a lot of experience in the auto industry. We spoke at length on the telephone, and suzie felt quite sure that she could make a good living with an internet car business, and I decided to go ahead and loan her the money to do that. 
>> Judge Judy: No, I want you to tell me the conversation that you had, the two of you. 
>> Okay. We were talking, and suzie was telling me that she was having a very hard timeing it. She said it was very difficult to get a job up there. 
>> Judge Judy: Well, that was over a long period of time. I want you to tell me specifically about the loan. 
>> Okay. We discussed suzie starting an internet automobile business. I asked her what would be involved. She said that she would need an excellent website, that she would need business cards, she would need a phone line. She had a lot, a lot of contacts that she felt would help her succeed in this business, and i agreed with her, because she had been in the business for so long and had done very well. I myself have purchased a few cars from her over the years, and I asked her how much s felt it would take, and she said it would be hly $6,0or her to get started and off the ground. 
>> Judge Judy: And when did that conversation take place? 
>> I believe it was december of 2011 or january 2012. 
>> Judge Judy: Okay. Go ahead. 
>> So, after speaking and talking back and forth and considering suzie's contacts and her ability to make a good living there, I was concerned for her. I was concerned for her daughter. 
>> Judge Judy: I heard all of that. 
>> And I agreed to loan her $6,000 to start this business. 
>> Judge Judy: Okay. Do you have proof of that check? 
>> Yes, I do. 
>> Judge Judy: I'd like to see it. 
>> Actually, it was a wire transfer. 
>> Judge Judy: Okay. What happened? 
>> What happened was I was under the impression that suzie was getting this business going. We spoke about a website. I was under the impression that she had sent the money to have the website done for her. We talked again about business cards and all the things that she would need, and my understanding was that this was going to happen in south carolina. And the next thing I knew was that suzie called to say that she was not able to make it in south carolina. She didn't want to be there anymore. She was going to bring her daughter back to south florida, leave her husband, and 
-- 
[00:04:16]



>> excuse me one second. Didn't you tell me to leave south carolina? 
>> Judge Judy: No, no, no. You'll have a chance to talk. 
>> Oh, okay. 
>> Judge Judy: You'll have a chance to talk. Go ahead. 
>> Okay. 
>> Judge Judy: So, she moved back to fort lauderdale. 
>> She moved back to fort lauderdale, and she came with her daughter and lived with me. 
>> Judge Judy: For how long? 
>> I think it was four or five months. Actually, I homeschooled her daughter through the end of the seventh grade during that time. 
>> Judge Judy: In what month and year did you leave south carolina and move back to fort lauderdale? 
>> January 2011. 
>> Judge Jud AND YOU WENT Right to miss tenner's house? 
>> Yes. 
>> Judge Judy: And you stayed there for how long? 
>> Four months until we were asked to leave. 
>> Judge Judy: When you were there for four months, did you pay rent? 
>> Did not. 
>> Judge Judy: Pay utilities? 
>> We 
-- we supplied all the food. 
>> Judge Judy: Did you pay utilities? 
>> No. 
>> Judge Judy: What conversation did you have that caused her to leave after four months? 
>> I actually was on the phone with her daughter that day. They were visiting suzie's mom. Her daughter had not gotten her work done the way she was supposed to for school. I had not seen a dime or any attempt on suzie's part to repay me, and actually, the conversation I had was with her mom. Suzie's mom picked up the phone and said, "tracy, do you want them to leave?" And I said, "if it's that easy, yes, I do." And they did. They moved out the next day. 
>> Judge Judy: Okay. Had the household been strained? 
>> For the last several weeks, it was, certainly. 
>> Judge Judy: Tell me why. 
>> Well, because suzie had made no attempt to repay me. We had discussed it at length. 
>> Judge Judy: Was she working? 
>> She was working barely. On and off. She had gotten a brief part-time job, and she was going to a lot of flea markets. She was going to yard sales. She was coming home with all sorts of rugs and tables and chairs and clothes, and I could not understand where she was getting the money and why the money was going into that rather than making an attempt to repay me. 
>> Judge Judy: Okay. Yore up. 
>> Okay, while living up in south carolina, again, tracy and I were very good friends. She was calling. We were speaking. I was calling her. She approached me with a business opportunity and said she had been talking to a friend of hers, and her friend had suggested with the talent that i have in the business that she invest in opening up a business. So, she actually came to me about doing it. I said, "let me have a day or so to think about it, and we'll talk about it." So after discussing it with my husband and what was going on up there, I called her back, and i said, "yeah, let's figure out what the figures would be to start a business. We'll need a web page, business cards. I'll have to go out a do some advertising 
-- that type of thing." So, at that time, she did wire-transfer me the money. 
[00:06:37]



>> Judge Judy: Just a second. 
>> Yes. 
>> Judge Judy: Well, if what you're suggesting is that you were going into business together 
-- is that what you're suggesting? 
>> I had asked if she wanted to put the business in her name for the tax write-off or whatever the case may be, and I would just work for her. Then that was okay, too. And she said, "no. I want you to do it 100% on your own. This is an investment, and --" 
>> Judge Judy: No. I'm just asking you. Clearly, based upon your last answer to me, if you're going into business with somebody, you 
-- 
>> yes. We were going into business together. 
>> Judge Judy: Well, that's what I'm asking you. Well, what was the business arrangement? 
>> Business arrangement was that we would get the business up and going, and she would get a percentage of the profit. 
>> Judge Judy: What percentage of the profit? 
>> Uh, I believe it was 
-- 
>> Judge Judy: You're just 
-- now you're making it up. I'm looking at your face, and right now you're making up this answer. You're trying to figure out where I'm gonna go. 
>> I'm trying to remember what the percentage was, to be honest. 
>> Judge Judy: No, you're 
-- you're making it up. Because if you have a business deal with somebody and they're supplying the money and you're supplying the work, you say, "well, it's a 60/40 split." "It's a 70/30 split." "It's a 50/50 split." That's not hard to remember if it's a business investment. When I asked you that question, you looked at me like a deer in headlights. 
>> It was a percentage. I really don't remember what the percentage was. 
>> Judge Judy: Well, then, you had no business deal. If you had no percentage, you had no business deal. And if you had a business deal that you were supposed to take this $6,000 and invest it in the business, even according to your own answer, you spent it on yourself and your daughter 
-- some of it. 
>> I 
-- no. I have receipts of what the money that went into the business. 
>> Judge Judy: Even by virtue of your own answer, you acknowledge that you spent money on yourself. 
>> What did I say I spent money on? 
>> Judge Judy: Moving. 
>> I didn't say I spent money on moving. 
>> Judge Judy: Okay, let's see. Maybe I'm wrong. There it is. 1,500 was going to cover my relocation costs." 
>> That was separate from this loan, your honor. This loan is for $5,000 for the business. The $6,000 
-- the other $1,000 was a personal loan, totally separate from this case. 
[00:08:37]



>> Judge Judy: Well, then, you didn't acknowledge that. You say, "$1,500 was going to cover my relocation costs." You didn't make that up just a moment 
-- that's not $1,000, first of all. It's $1,500. And you didn't say that that $1,500 was a personal loan. Did you repay it? 
>> No. 
>> Judge Judy: How come that doesn't say anything here about a loan that you didn't repay? 
>> 'Cause this has nothing to do with this case. 
>> Judge Judy: Sure it does. She said $6,000. You just said to me $5,000 was for the business, the other $1,000 was for a personal loan. 4,500 was for the business. 
>> Judge Judy: No. 
>> Yes. 1,500 was for a personal loan. I'm telling you that's what it was. 
>> Judge Judy: Just a second. That's not what you said here. 
>> Well, I can't help what they wrote. I'm telling you what I said. 
>> Judge Judy: No, no, no. You signed. 
>> Announcer: "Judge judy" continues in a moment. And later today... 
>> It has a lot to do with it, 'cause he sit up here and lied. 
>> Judge Judy: It has nothing to do with anything. 
>> It destroys my character. 
>> Judge Judy: Listen. He didn't destroy your character at all. 
>> How do we know warren didn't come over there with the popcorn seed in his ear? 
>> Judge Judy: Oh, don't be ridiculous. Now you're destroying your own character.

>> Announcer: Real cases. Real people. "Judge judy." Tracy tenner says former friend suzanne wheeler owes for a loan to start a business. Suzanne claims the money was an investment, not a loan. 
>> Judge Judy: You signed. You want to look at what you signed? 4,500 
-- business loan. 
>> Judge Judy: No. Show me where it says that anywhere. Want to look at it? 
>> Bring it over. 
>> Judge Judy: Want to give that to her, please? 
>> Maybe I should have read a little more. 
>> Judge Judy: Just show me where it says

>> Judge Judy: You just told me $5,000 was allocated for business costs. 4,500 was for

>> Judge Judy: Judgment for the plaintiff in the amount of $5,000. 
>> Fine. 
>> Judge Judy: Don't do it by memory, if you 
-- that's all. 
>> Thank you, your honor. 
>> Judge Judy: Thank you. 
>> Byrd: Parties are excused. You may step out. 
>> You know, I think it was probably foolish. Suzie and I had known each other a very long time. 
>> It was a business investment. It didn't work. 
>> And I really thought she+d be successful and we would never get to this point. 
>> It just got ugly, that's all. 
>> The final straw, I think, was suzie spending money on herself and making no attempt whatsoever to repay me. 
>> You know, if everybody could invest in a business and get 100% of their money back, we'd all be doing it. 
>> I guess what I learned is that you don't loan money to friends. 
>> Our friendship is still friendship as far as not business. 
>> I hope that we will be. I hope that we will be and this helps us to put it all in the past. 
>> Announcer: And now the next case. 
[00:14:11]



>> Byrd: All parties in the MATTER OF WHITE vs. HIGGINS, Step forward. 
>> Announcer: Robert white is suing the parents of his son's friend, shawana and andre higgins, for medical bills after his son was injured during a sleepover at their home. 
>> Judge Judy: Mr. White, this is not a difficult case. You can sit down, young man. It's not a difficult case. This is your little boy. This is your little boy. Your little boy was celebrating a birthday and having a sleepover to celebrate the birthday party and invited your son to come over for the party. 
>> Yes, ma'am. 
>> Judge Judy: And you agreed to let him go over there. 
>> Yes, 'am. 
>> Judge Judy: Did you ask how many kids were gonna be there? 
>> Yes, I did. 
>> Judge Judy: And what did they tell you? 
>> They said several of his classmates and relatives. 
>> Judge Judy: Well, several isn't a number. 
>> They didn't give me an exact number. 
>> Judge Judy: Were you satisfied with that answer? 
>> No, I wasn't. 
>> Judge Judy: Well, then, why did you let him go? 
>> Well, one of the things i wanted to know was if they would be supervised. 
>> Judge Judy: Just a second. Don't 
-- let's not get to what you think you have to tell me in order to win your lawsuit. 
>> Yes, ma'am. I'm sorry. 
>> Judge Judy: Let's stay with if you asked how many people would be there and you didn't get an answer that you were satisfied with, why did you let your sono? 
>> Well, I asked to meet mrs. Higgins. And the name did not ring a bell, because he's a classmate of my son's, so I wanted to meet her. 
>> Judge Judy: Did you meet her? 
>> And I asked to meet her, and I did meet her. 
>> Judge Judy: Good. So, despite the fact that you didn't get an answer as to how many people re gonna be there, you were comfortable that it was gonna be a family party, and you were comfortable letting him go. 
>> Yes, ma'am. 
>> Judge Judy: And so, this is what happened. He went there, and somehow he got a kernel of corn stuck in his ear. He's gonna tell me how that happened. And you want them to be responsible for pain and suffering and bills and lost wages to the tune of $5,000. 
>> Yes, ma'am. 
>> Judge Judy: I'm just curious, mr. White 
-- do you think that, absent negligence on their part, that they are insurers of your child's welfare he was at this birthday party? 
>> Well, when you're having a sleepover, your honor, and I ask you if my son will be in your care and custody, you say my son will be in your care and custody at all times 
-- 
[00:16:17]



>> Judge Judy: No, no, no, mr. White. That's not true. That's not true. You never said that. Because if he's having a sleepover, you didn't think that they were gonna sleep in the same room with the children. Do you sleep in the same room with your son? 
>> On occasion, yes. 
>> Judge Judy: I didn't ask you occasionally. Occasionally, of course. Maybe you do if he's not feeling well or something. But I assume that at 5 years old, he doesn't sleep with you. 
>> Correct. 
>> Judge Judy: Well, you wouldn't expect this young man's parents to sleep with their son and your son. Then you might have a problem with that. Thati would have a problem with. 
[ Laughter ] 
>> Announcer: "Judge judy" continues in a moment. 
>> Judge Judy: Do you know who i am? Are you scared of me? 
[ Laughter ] good. Now, you got this kernel of corn in your ear. You want to tell me how that happened? horrible side. An intense burning sensation like somebody had set it on fire. And the doctor said, cindie, you have shingles. He said, you had chickenpox when you were a little girl... I said, yes, I did. I don't think anybody ever thinks they're going to get shingles.

[00:19:31]



>> Announcer: Real cases. Real people. "Judge judy." Robert white says his son was injured during a sleepover at the home of shawana and andre higgins. 
>> Judge Judy: Young man, you want to come over here? I have a few questions for you. Tell me your name. 
>> Warren. 
>> Judge Judy: Rory? 
>> No, warren. 
>> Judge Judy: Ah, do you know who I am? Hmm? Are you scared of me? 
[ Laughter ] good. Could you keep your voice up so I can hear you? 
>> Yes. 
>> Judge Judy: Now, you remember the birthday party? 
>> Yes. 
>> Judge Judy: You want to tell me where you got this kernel of corn from? 
>> Popcorn. 
>> Judge Judy: Popcorn. Who gave you the popcorn? 
>> Myles' mom. 
>> Judge Judy: Myles' mom. Did she give it to you in a big bowl? Hmm? 
>> Yes. 
>> Judge Judy: Did all the kids have popcorn? How many kids were there? 
>> Seven. 
>> Judge Judy: Seven. Did you know them all? 
>> I only know two, because two of them was from my school. 
>> Judge Judy: Okay. And the others were other friends or relatives. Were they all about your age? 
>> Mnh-mnh. 
>> Judge Judy: Were some older? Some younger? Okay. Now, you got this kernel of corn in your ear. You want to tell me how that happened? 
>> Well, we was laying 
-- I was laying down, and some of them was playing and stuff. And one of them just picked up a seed from the floor and just dropped it in my ear, thinking it would be funny. 
>> Judge Judy: So, one of the kids? Do you remember which kid that was? 
>> I don't know. 
>> Judge Judy: Okay. Why don't you go have a seat over there? Come on up here, myles. Come on. Hi. 
>> Hi. 
>> Judge Judy: Who put the kernel of corn in his ear? 
>> One of my cousins. 
>> Judge Judy: What's his name? 
>> [Bleep] 
>> Judge Judy: How old is he? 
>> He's 9. 
>> Judge Judy: What did you say to him when he put the kernel of corn in his ear? 
>> Nothing. 
>> Judge Judy: Did you tell your mother and father who did it? 
[00:21:33]



>> Yes. 
>> Judge Judy: Okay. Great. Terrific. Sit back. Well, you see, that's a little problem that you have. Because you have a 5 year old 
-- that's how old your son is 
-- or was? 
>> Yes, ma'am. 
>> Judge Judy: And you allowed a child who was almost twice that age to be in a room, unsupervised, with a 5 year old. And I don't actually think that you are insurers of their welfare if you have seven 5-year-olds, and it's possible that it could have happened if it was one of the 5 year olds. But in this case, you have a kid who's much older and much bigger and took advantage of a child half his age. And that isyour responsibility, 'cause if you're gonna have 
-- how many kids were 5? 
>> Actually, only one was 5, which was warren. There was a total of seven kids there. 
>> Judge Judy: Right. 
>> He was the only 5-year-old. Myles is 7. I didn't hear exactly what myles just told you about who put it in his ear, but that's my first time hearing about who actually put it in the ear. 
>> Judge Judy: Well, he wouldn't lie to me, right? 
>> Yeah, and I understand. 
>> Judge Judy: Right, myles? 
>> Yes. 
>> Judge Judy: Good for you. 
[ Laughter ] 
>> Judge Judy: Now you know who did it. 
>> Mm-hmm. 
>> Judge Judy: And that child who did it was twice his age. So, you know, initially, I said to mr. White, "they're not insurers of your son's safety." But if you have different age groups of children, then you have to make sure that they are more adequately supervised. 
>> Okay. 
>> Judge Judy: You have to do that.

-- over. The intense ache made it hard to do the things that I wanted. My doctor diagnosed it as fibromyalgia 
-- thought to be the result of over-active nerves that cause chronic, widespread pain. Lyrica is believed to calm these nerves. I learned lyrica can provide significant relief from fibromyalgia pain. So now, I can do more of the things I enjoy. Lyrica is not for everyone. It may cause serious allergic reactions or suicidal thoughts or actions. Tell your doctor right away if you have these, new or worsening depression, or unusual changes in mood or behavior. Or swelling, trouble breathing, rash, hives, blisters, changes in eyesight including blurry vision, muscle pain with fever, or tired feeling. Common side effects are dizziness, sleepiness, weight gain and swelling of hands, legs and feet. Don't drink alcohol while taking lyrica. Don't drive or use machinery until you know how lyrica affects you. Those who have had a drug or alcohol problem may be more likely to misuse lyrica. With less pain, I'm feeling better with lyrica. Ask your doctor if lyrica is right for your fibromyalgia pain. 
[00:27:23]



>> Judge Judy: Now, I don't think that you are insurers to the extent of $5,000 unless you had $5,000 worth of medical bills. Did you? 
>> No, ma'am. 
>> Judge Judy: What were your medical bills? Un-reimbursed. 
>> The medical bills totaled $1,008, your honor. 
>> Judge Judy: Those were un-reimbursed by any form of insuranck, is that right? 
>> Yes, ma'am. 
>> Judge Judy: May I see those, please? Anything else you want to say, mr. And mrs. Higgins? 
>> Yes. Mr. White just stated to you that he asked to meet me. Mr. White did not ask to meet me. On my invitation with my itinerary of what the kids was gonna be doing, I listed a drop-off time and pick-up time for each child, and I let them know the activities that we were gonna be doing. Mr. White did not rsvp. He called friday- the day of the party 
-- 
>> Judge Judy: What difference does that have to do with what i just said to you? 
>> It has a lot to do with it, 'cause he sit up here and lied. 
>> Judge Judy: Well, it has nothing to do with anything. 
>> It destroys my character. 
>> Judge Judy: Listen. No, no, no. No. He didn't destroy your character at all. He didn't destroy your character at all. 
>> And the other child who i believe myles said his name was [bleep] is not 9. He was 7 at that time. Now, how do we know warren didn't come over there with the popcorn seed in his ear? 
>> Judge Judy: Oh, don't be ridiculous. Now you're destroying your own character. 
[ Laughter ] judgment for the plaintiff in the amount of $1,008. 
>> No, actually, I'm not. 
>> Judge Judy: Thank you. That's all. 
>> Byrd: Parties are excused. You may step out. 
>> Announcer: "Judge judy" continues in a moment. And on the next "judge judy"... 
>> Se people are habitual liars. 
>> I'm not a liar. 
>> He lied 
-- stated that he wanted to talk to me. This man dropped his son off. 
>> When I first got to the house, I met mr. Myles. Then they exchanged gifts. 
>> He didn't even know my name. He never came inside my house. 
>> So, I had no problem leaving him with them at the time. 
[00:29:24]



>> He never looked around. He never met me. 
>> So, she wasn't even there to know what happened, first of all. 
>> You can leave your son with me in my care without meeting me... 
>> It's similar to when we wanted to serve her. 
>> ...But you drop your son off with me, and now you want to sue me? 
>> The process server 
-- she lied and said that sheasn't mrs. Higgins. 
>> But yet and still, you want to sue me because... 
>> She threw the paper out. So, mrs. Higgins is the person that's not reputable, not me. 
>> ...He has something stuck in his ear. For all I know, he came here with it. --Captions by VITAC-- www.vitac.com Why did you move out shortly after moving in?

>> Judge Judy: Thank you. 
>> Byrd: You're welcome, judge. Parties have been sworn in. You may be seated. Have a seat, please. 
>> Judge Judy: Miss fasel, you and the defendant were in a relationship. You signed a lease for an apartment together that was to run from january of 2012 to DECEMBER 31st. 
>> Yes, your honor. 
>> Judge Judy: At some point, you decided to leave the apartment. 
>> Yes, your honor. 
>> Judge Judy: When? 
>> A week after moving into the APARTMENT, JANUARY 7th. 
>> Judge Judy: So, now you claim that the defendant owes you some money... 
>> Yes, your honor. 
>> Judge Judy: ...And then you claim that while you were together, you cosigned for a car for her, and because she did not make a couple of car payments, you took the car back, and there were some tickets that had to be paid, some repairs that had to be done on the car. You want her to be responsible for that.

>> ...Several years ago from her. I believe she owed u-haul about $200. My brother-in-law had to rent 
-- 
>> Judge Judy: Listen to me. I don't have all day. I'm asking you a question. It was a very simple question. You moved out shortly after you moved in. Why? 
>> The relationship was off, and the defendant wanted me to move out. She wavted to keep the apartment, so I honored that by moving out february 1, 2012. 
>> Judge Judy: When you say the relationship was off 
-- when did you have the discussion where she said, "i want you to move out"? 
>> I do have e-mail documents. 
>> 
[ Tapping fingers ] 
>> Judge Judy: Stop! 
>> January 11, 2012, was the final decision that she was going to keep the apartment. I was going to vacate it. 
>> Judge Judy: That still doesn't answer the question. I want to tell me what precipitated you moving out of the apartment. 
>> The reason why I moved out of the apartment and ended the relationship was we had a very long strain of financial stress. The defendant was unable to keep a job. She continually got fired from repeated jobs, and I took on most of the finances in the relationship. 
>> Judge Judy: Is that why you moved out? 
>> That's why I ended the relationship. 
>> Judge Judy: Well, then, can you tell me why 
-- since you'd been a couple for a while before you moved into this apartment 
-- why you signed a lease with her? 
>> In this particular apartment, I signed the lease because we had moved out of an apartment previously that had black mold. Everything happened very quickly. I proceeded to get more and more unhappy in the relationship due to the finances. 
>> Judge Judy: Well, but you're talking about four weeks. 
>> Yes. 
>> Judge Judy: Well, in four weeks, you had no place else to go, where you could say, "listen, I have to clear my head," for four weeks and not sign off on a lease? 
>> No, your honor. The 
-- 
>> Judge Judy: Okay. How did you expect her to pay the rent when you moved out? 
[00:04:14]



>> Initially, when I ended the relationship, I thought since we had been together so long that we might be able to amicably 
-- since it was a two-bedroom apartment 
-- stay until we could make arrangements so she would not be financially stressed. I never wanted to put her under financial duress. 
>> Judge Judy: So, you thought that you could both stay there... 
>> Yes. ...Without being in a relationship. It was a two-bedroom apartment, and...? 
>> Which is ridiculous, I know now. 
>> Judge Judy: No, it's not ridiculous. If you both have a lease, it's not ridiculous. So, what happened when you proposed that to each other? 
>> Well, the defendant said that was absolutely not the case. I had hurt her too much. She did not want anything to do with me and wanted me to vacate. 
>> Judge Judy: When you moved out, where did you move to? 
>> I moved to a friend's house 
-- peter's. I rented a room from him, still in south philadelphia. 
>> Judge Judy: Okay. Now, how long did you stay in the apartment? 
>> I was in the apartment till the end of the lease. 
>> Judge Judy: Did you have another roommate? 
>> I tried to have one roommate. 
>> Judge Judy: Did you have another roommate? Yes or no? 
>> For a month, yes. 
>> Judge Judy: What month? 
>> March. 
>> Judge Judy: So, she moved out in february, and you had another roommate in march? 
>> For one month, yes. 
>> Judge Judy: Who was that roommate? 
>> Someone I found off of craigslist 
-- not a good person. Did not pay his rent for the duration of the month that he was there, and I kicked him out at the end of the month. 
>> Judge Judy: And then? 
>> And then I had a friend of mine come back from california. She needed a place to stay. She stayed for a week, decided to stay for two months. She stayed for the duration of two and then three. She did not pay her rent. 
>> Judge Judy: Well, that's 
-- 
>> she did not pay the bills, and then she 
-- 
>> Judge Judy: That's not her problem. If you invited your friend and your friend did not pay her bills, that is not her problem. 
>> Exactly. 
>> Judge Judy: Great. Now, did you receive your security deposit back? 
>> I signed it over to stacey. 
>> Judge Judy: How much? 
>> The deposit was sent directly to her. 
>> Judge Judy: How much did you receive? 
>> Your honor, the escrow 
-- 
>> Judge Judy: How much? 170. 
>> Judge Judy: How much did you put in? 1,000. 
>> Judge Judy: Show me that you put in $1,000. 
>> Your honor, the documentation that I am going to give you is a letter from pnc with the fendant, the landlord, and my name on itshowing that $2,000 was put into escrow. I willfully admit 
-- 
[00:06:22]



>> Judge Judy: Shh. 
>> Sorry. 
>> Judge Judy: Got it. 
>> I willfully admit that the defendant put in $1,000 into escrow. 
>> Judge Judy: Now, do you have the closing statement from the apartment? 
>> The closing statement? 
>> Judge Judy: Well, you had security deposit. Did the landlord withhold security deposit? 
>> I signed everything over to stacey, so all correspondence went through him and stacey 
-- 
>> Judge Judy: All she got was $170 back of the $2,000? 
>> Yes. 
>> Judge Judy: Did you not pay rent for a period of time? 
>> No. No. 
>> Judge Judy: You have a closing statement? 
>> Yes, your honor. I have the itemization. 
>> Judge Judy: You have nothing, then she's gonna give me the documents. 
>> Your honor, I also want to let you know that the e-mail behind that is a statement from the landlord saying that 
-- 
>> Judge Judy: No, no, no, no. I don't read statements from the landlord. When they're withholding security deposits, there's a reason. Well, there was a $900 security deposit and a $200 pet deposit. Who had the pet? 
>> Your honor, we did. 
>> Judge Judy: Who took the pet? 
>> I paid the deposit... 
>> Judge Judy: Shh. 
>> ...And we split our pets. 
>> Judge Judy: Okay, you stayed an extra two days into december? 
>> I'm sorry? Two days into december? 
>> Judge Judy: "Amount of any rent owed through the day..." 
>> I stayed until january. Well, I actually left early 
-- so, the premises was vacant 
-- to move into a new place. 
>> Judge Judy: Did anybody paint a green mural? 
>> No. 
>> Your honor, her roommate 
-- that, allegedly, she states stayed for only two months 
-- painted her room. 
>> Judge Judy: Bup! 
[ Raps desk ] 
>> did not say that. 
>> Judge Judy: Listen to me. Careful! Hey! I'm talking to you. 
>> I'm sorry. 
>> Judge Judy: Just answer my questions when I ask you a question. I don't want you to talk to her. 
>> Yes, ma'am. 
>> Judge Judy: I don't want you to have any conversation with yourself. I ju want you to answer questions that I ask you. 
>> Okay. 
>> Judge Judy: Great. How did the paint, with green oil-based paint, that was in a mural form, get in the front bedroom and the front bathroom? Who did that? 
[00:08:25]



>> My friend painted the room, but there was 
-- 
>> Judge Judy: Then you pay this $650 because they deducted $650 from the security deposit because they had to repaint that, restore it back to its original "eggshell-neutral color." So, if your friend did it, go get it from your friend. Okay. Now, that's $650 from yo security deposit. Now let's deal with the big part of the debt, which is this credit card. Go. 
>> Your honor, in 2009, at the time when we were in a relationship 
-- 
>> Judge Judy: You gave her the credit card. Keep going. 
>> I put her on the credit card. She, through the process of years, maxed it out and then continued to have problems paying it 
-- paying it late, bounced payments, over the limit. 
>> Judge Judy: Did you ever pay it for her? 
>> Recently, yes. When I transferred the card, i did. 
>> Judge Judy: Not now. Now you do it to protect your credit. When you were together as a couple, did you pay that bill? 
>> I did not because I did not put the charges on that card, your honor. 
>> Judge Judy: So, she was paying for the charges that she put on the card. 
>> Yes, your honor. 
>> Judge Judy: And what was the balance on that card at the time that you separated? 2,600, your honor. 
>> Judge Judy: And did you discuss that with her? 
>> Yes, we discussed that. 
>> Judge Judy: And how did you resolve it? 
>> The defendant stated that she was going to make good and make minimum payments on the card to pay it off. 
>> Judge Judy: That means it never gets paid off if you just make the minimum payments on it. 
>> Unfortunately, I believed her that she would pay the card off. 
>> Judge Judy: Did you make the payments on the card? 
>> Yes, the minimum, because it's all I could afford. 
>> Judge Judy: And how much is left? 2,600. Whatever stacey says. I honestly 
-- I have no idea what the remaining balance is. 
>> Judge Judy: Well, when was the last time you made a payment? 
>> Like, last month. 
>> Judge Judy: How much did you make? 
>> Uh, sent her $150. 
>> Judge Judy: Can I see the last statement on that credit card? 
>> Your honor, on the credit card 
-- as a result of the financial duress I've been under, I've actually been having to use that actual discover card that I transferred the balance to live, so the actual statement does not reflect that total. I was only seeking the $2,600, plus $78 transfer fee for that card to pay it off. 
[00:10:29]



>> Judge Judy: But she said she's been paying. 
>> I can give you the statements, you honor, that show that the payments that she has been making have all bounced on this discover card. 
>> Judge Judy: Show me the checks that you sent to them. 
>> I don't have them. 
>> Judge Judy: Why not? 
>> I wasn't expecting this. 
>> Judge Judy: What do you mean? Where did you think you were coming? 
[ Light laughter ] 
>> Announcer: "Judge judy" continues in a moment. 
>> Judge Judy: So, what did you do with the car? 
>> My witness, katie... 
>> Her new lover, by the way, who she left me for. 
>> Judge Judy: Are you 
-- just a second. Are you talking? 
>> Announcer: And later today... 
>> He came to me because he was on the verge of being evicted from his apartment, so 
-- 
>> Judge Judy: Why? 
>> We had a roommate issue, and that's when she came in. And with the money issue, um 
-- 
>> Judge Judy: You know, I'm afraid I'm hearing a lot of double-talk.

>> Announcer: Real cases. Real people. "Judge judy." Stacey fasel says ex-girlfriend jennifer hartman owes for a debt that was transferred to her credit card, the return of a security deposit, and car expenses. 
>> Judge Judy: Now, you knew it was about a credit card. That's the major part of her complaint. 
>> I thought the major part of the complaint was the lease... 
>> Judge Judy: The lease? 
>> ...And her asking for the entire security deposit back. 
>> Judge Judy: No, she's gonna get $650 back, in addition to the $170 she's already gotten. She has $2,600, which is this credit card. That was a big piece of her complaint. So, what do you have to show me how many payments you made? 
>> I don't. 
>> Judge Judy: You don't? 
>> No. I don't have any access to the accounts. Stacey has every single password changed on the accounts, so there's no way for me to access any of that. 
>> Judge Judy: Well, she had to close it out because she was afraid that you were gonna keep spending money. I wouldn't have kept the card open. That's foolish. 
>> Ridiculous. 
>> Judge Judy: Well, you did make certain payments, but they were all returned. 
>> There was an issue with my account. I had a separate account. 
>> Judge Judy: Oh, I have no issues. Okay. Now, you took the car back when? 
>> I took the car back october 23 of 2012, your honor. 
>> Judge Judy: Want to tell me why? 
>> I took the car back reluctantly because I actually do not possess a driver's license. I've never driven a day in my life, and I ride a bicycle 'cause I've always lived in an urban environment. With that said, I only reclaimed the car when I discovered that she was five months behind on car payments. We were discussing it, but after seeing that she was bouncing payments on the credit card...

>> She 
-- 
>> Judge Judy: That's either a yes or a no. 
>> Yes, your honor. 
>> Judge Judy: Good, then deal with the car. All I want her to do is pay for her own parking tickets. How much were the parking tickets? 
>> The parking tickets, in total, your honor, that I paid 'cause they were in collections, was $312. I have a statement that there's still $144 left on those tickets, your honor. 
>> Judge Judy:3,362

>> Judge Judy: Miss shearer, when were you and the defendant involved in a dating relationship? From when to when? 
>> We ended in december, starting october, around halloween time, so october to december. 
[ Chuckles ] 
>> Judge Judy: Of last year? 
>> Of last year. 
>> Judge Judy: And you claim that you loaned him some money. 
>> Yes. 
>> Judge Judy:450. When did you loan him the money? 
>> November 12, 2012. 
>> Judge Judy: Tell me how that came about. 
>> Well, while we were dating, we had gotten pretty close pretty quickly, and he came to me because he was on the verge of being evicted from his apartment, so 
-- 
>> Judge Judy: Why? 
>> We had a roommate issue. One of them went active-duty military, and we couldn't afford to pay rent 'cause we had three people staying there, so when he left, instead of getting evicted, we decided that it would be better to just kind of close out and sign the lease over and get out of the apartments 'cause we couldn't find a third roommate to help us pay for rent. 
[00:17:50]



>> Judge Judy: And? 
>> And, uh, that's, uh

>> Judge Judy: Now, a roommate went into the military. The two of you remaining couldn't afford to stay in the apartment, so you were going to vacate the apartment and go find someplace where you could live and afford it.

>> Judge Judy: And that was in november.

>> Judge Judy: Why would she have to help you out? How old are you? 
>> I'm 20. 
>> Judge Judy: Well, then, you still get the chance to be helped out because you're hardly grown yet. So, if she helped you out, that's what she's supposed to do. So, you didn't go to her because you were embarrassed?

>> Judge Judy: He still needs a lot of help. I think you should go move back in with your mother. 
>> 
[ Laughs ] that could be good, sometimes. 
>> Judge Judy: Well, I think you should. I mean, most people know if they're out on their own

I'm so excited! I'm going to meet Professor Monkey! Skits, you want to go inside? You might get to sniff a monkey. (barks) Ah. You guys go inside. We're going to stay outside and smell these books. Ooh. The seat next to this is better. I can't believe we're the only two people here to see them. No, we're the only early birds. 

[00:04:00]


The show doesn't start until 3:00. What? That's two hours from now. (sniffing) Mmm... woody, with just a hint of photo paper. That's where we'll be doing our show later, Professor. (chittering anxiously) There's no crowd here yet, but we don't start until 3:00. Don't worry. (chittering) Excuse me, I understand most animals, but I can't understand him. Is he a foreign monkey? He understands every language, but he's never learned to speak anything except monkey. This dog talks, but you, a genius, can't take time to learn another language? Eh! (blows raspberry) If you want to learn all about Professor Monkey, come see us at 3:00. Bring your people! (chatring) Okay, if you're worried, we'll go over it one more time. After your lute solo, I'll show them how to make a paper plane following our book's instructions, like this. They'll all buy books when they see how the instructions help me make a perfect plane. (groans) Hmm, maybe you should make the plane. I'll do the hockey stick door-knocker. (chattering) These are directions. They tell you how to get where you need to go. You use these to find the bookstore later. (chattering) I have to get my banana costume from the dry cleaners while youtake a bath. I'll meet you at the bookstore. I know. 3:00. I'll be there. Take a bath. You know it relaxes you. (whining) (chattering) TD: That seat in front of the stage looks better! Follow me! We changed seats nine times. This one's the best. Really. (sighs) (cheerful humming) 

[00:06:13]


(chittering happily) (gasps) (horrified chattering) (screaming) (chirping) (growling) (chattering) (growling) (dog barking, monkey shrieking) (barking) I don't care what anybody says. Books will never replace meat. (monkey chattering) (barking) Hey, aren't you that professor who writes instruction books? (chattering anxiously) (barking) Uh, I don't understand him, either. He understands us, but he only speaks monkey. (chittering) Uh, don't go there. Bob's usually under that porch. We're not going follow you! (whining) (chattering) (barking) (shrieking) (growling) (chattering) Something you want is under there? Did Bob take your soap under the porch while you were in the shower? (chattering) (chirping) Excuse me, bird, do you understand monkey? (tweeting) Hmm, he doesn't, but he's seen a giraffe talk to a monkey at the zoo. That doesn't help us... (gasps) unless we bring the giraffe here to talk to the professor. Lead the way, bird. I'll follow you. (chirping) We'll be back, Professor. 

[00:08:15]


We want monkey! We want monkey! We want... (tweeting) Hi, how's the weather up there? (laughing) Do you speak monkey? (bleating) (tweeting) Hmm, she doesn't understand me, but she understood you. Ask her if she'd help me understand a monkey. (tweeting) (bleating) That's great. Oh, but how do we get her out? Let's dig under the fence. (creaking) Whoa, she can get out? (tweeting) All the animals know how to get out, but as long as they're happy, they stay inside. (barking) I hope the lions are happy, too. Dad, dad, look. Yes, that's very nice, son. That banana in front of the bookstore looks awfully familiar. It's time to start. No sign of Professor Monkey? No, can we wait a little longer? I gave him good directions. (snorting) (growling) (barking) (frightened chattering) (growling) (panting) MARTHA: We're back, Professor Monkey. (barking) (growling) (grunts) Okay, I'll talk to the professor, he'll talk to the giraffe, and the giraffe talks to the bird, and the bird talks to me, okay? (chattering) (bleating) (tweeting) They say, "Okay." So, Professor, what's wrong? 

[00:10:17]


(chattering) (bleating) (tweeting) He needs to retrieve his paper plane. (tweeting) "Retrieve" means to get something. (barking) I don't know. I'll ask. Where do you need to retrieve it from? (chattering) (bleating) (tweeting) He needs to retrieve it from under the porch, but he can't get around the nasty dog. (barking) Good question. Can't you just make another paper plane? (shrieks, blows raspberry) (bleating) (tweeting) Hmm. No. He would have thought of that. He's a genius. Bob? (barking) Professor Monkey wants to go around you to the porch behind you, and retrieve his plane from under the porch. (barking) He says no, no, no, no, no. (chattering) I have an idea! Huddle! (all communicating quietly) (chattering, bleating, tweeting) Okay! That's the plan! Skits, run! Follow me! Bob! We're going to step on your lawn, and you can't stop us! (barking) (barking) We did it, Skits! Look behind Bob! (Bob barks) Me and my big mouth. (chitters) (yelps) (Bob barks) We did it! Great teamwork! (chatters) (rips, chomps) (gulps) (groans) The plane's not behind Bob anymore, it's inside him. What was so special about that plane anyway? 

[00:12:19]


(chittering) (bleating) (tweeting) It had directions to the bookstore on it, and now you'll miss your show? (whimpers sadly) You don't need directions. I can lead you there. (chatters) I'll lead you. I'll show you how to get there. Follow me. BEPPO: So I have to cancel this show and try to find Professor Monkey. (crowd groans) Say it ain't so, Beppo! Say it ain't so! I'm so worried. Maybe he lost the directions. (entrance bell chimes) (chitters "ta-da," crowd cheers) Professor Monkey! You made it! (cheering and applause) What an entrance! What a show! What a monkey! (elephant trumpets) How could a whole giraffe be missing? (crying) Is that the missing giraffe, behind thisclosed gate? Hmph! MARTHA: Don't worry, animals can't get out of the zoo when they want to anymore than dogs can talk. (barks) You lead the way, Skits. I'll follow behind you. Mom, I can't find it anywhere! MOM: Did you look on the hook behind the door? Yes. It's not there! Did you look on top of your dresser? Yes. It's not there! Did you look under all that stuff on top of your dresser? (muffled): Yes. It's not there either! Did you look in the mirror? What do yomean? Look in the mirror! My hat! I found it! It's on top of my head! Let's go! Hmm, where's the door? Never mind! I found it! I'm coming! 

[00:14:30]


(TV plays) Hello! Shh! (door closes) Where is everybody? Garden tour. What're you watching? Canine Careers. It's a show about different dog breeds and their jobs. Now, shh! (dog howls on TV) What's this week's dog? (groans) HOST (on TV): Today, we're following our friend, the bloodhound. What he said. This mournful-looking fellow with a fantastic nose. In fact, the bloodhound's sense of smell makes him very good at tracking. "Tracking"? You mean he leaves muddy footprints on the kitchen floor? And when I say "tracking," I don't mean he leaves muddy footprints on the kitchen floor. When this dog tracks, he finds and follows a certain smell. (sniffing) Oh! Tracking is a gift that comes in handy when you've misplaced something important. (baying) And you can take that to the bank. (sighs) I sure wish I had a bloodhound. Why? Are you missing something? Uh-huh. I lost it at Dog Head Lake. And if I don't find it soon, there could be trouble. I could help you locate it. You're not a bloodhound, are you? Mmm, who knows? I'm a mutt. There's all kinds of dogs mixed up inside me. One could be a bloodhound. Uh-huh. No, really. I'm a great sniffer. I once found a three-month-old Easter egg everyone had given up on. Wow! Do you think you and your nose could help me search for my thing? Mm-hmm, sure. Why not? Maybe it'll be the start of a new career. (howling) I've located your missing puppy. Located? You mean you've found her?! That's exat I mean. She's behind that tree. (barks) (gasps) (barks) My hero! 

[00:16:33]


(shutters clicking) So, what did you misplace? Uh, I can't tell you. It's a secret. How am I supposed to locate it if I don't know what it is? Easy. It smells like me. (sniffing) (laughing) Hold still, will you? Got it! Great! Let's get cracking while the trail is fresh. "Trail"? You mean a road? No, I mean, the other kind of trail. Like a smell something leave behind. Like when your mom puts on perfume before going out. (sneezes) It leaves a trail you smell, even aftershe's gone. TRUMAN: Okay, it should be around here. Great! I'll locate your whatsits in no time. (Martha sniffs, Truman laughs) You found a trail already? Wow! Talk about a fast tracker. Shh, you're snuffing my sniffing. (resumes sniffing) Not far off now. Maybe behind this bush. Aha! Gotcha! You found my missing thing? (chewing): No. But I found half a moldy bologna sandwich. (chewing): Mmm. Yum! You know, I could locate your thingamajig faster if you'd tell me what it was. I can't. I mean... I know you think of me as a rugged tough guy. I do? I mean, I do. If I told you what I lost, you might think about me differently. Ah, oh. What if I guess? Could you tell me then? (sighs) Okay. Is it a library book? Unh-uh. A shoe? Unh-uh. It's something that makes me feel safer. Uh... a calculator. Unh-uh. A teddy bear? I'm not a baby. I got nothing. What is it? 

[00:18:35]


I can't tell. But it's somewhere near here. (resumes sniffing) (flies buzzing) (chitters) (sniffing) Hmm... (sniffing) (sniffing) I'm sorry, nothing around here smells Truman-y. (laughing) (sniffing) Except you. (sighs) Are you sure this is where you lost your whosits? No. It was over there. (buzzing, fluttering) Then why are we looking over here?! 'Cause there are bugs over there, and bugs are the whole reason I need my... ...thing I can't tell you about. It protects me from bugs. I know it's irrational, I know bugs can't hurt me. They're tiny, and I'm big. But they're itchy, and hey're crawly, and they're very unpredictable. I'm just not comfortable around nature. Books are more myspeed. A book is very predictable. A book just sits there. Books never buzz at you or crawl on you or... What? What is it? Mmm, nothing. Is it a bug? There's a bug on me, isn't there?! Well, uh... (screaming) Stop, Truman! Wait! There's a bug on me! There's a bug on me! (screaming) (screaming) (yelling, panting) (panting) Oh, thank goodness! Now... 

[00:20:36]


(screaming) I'm sorry I freaked out. I couldn't help it. Maybe we should give up-- we've search everywhere. Searched? We haven't searched. "Search" means to look for something very carefully. All we've done is run in circles and-and scream. That's good enough for me. So you want to give up? Just head home? Great idea. Only... where ishome? Oh, no! We're lost! We're lost, and we're surrounded by bugs! I got to lay down. Truman, we're not lost. (gasps) What am I doing? The ground is probably crawling with bugs! There are probably more bugs around me right now than have ever been around me in my life. Take it easy, Truman. We're not lost. I know the direction home. It's not that far. If only I had my... you know. Actually, I don't, but I wish I did. It's the only thing that can calm me down at a time like this. Hey, Wait. You're right. We're not lost. This is the spot. This is where I misplaced my thing. What? What did you lose? Uh, you'll think it's dumb. You'll say it's silly. I will not, I promise. I'd cross my heart, but paws don't do that. (inhales loudly) It's... It's... a rock. A rock?! You weregoing to say that's silly. No, no, no. It's okay. Even I think it's silly, but this was my lucky rock. Somehow, with it, I wasn't afraid of anything. (roaring) Monsters. (growling) Mean dogs. Not even bugs. (insect chirping) Don't you worry, Truman. I'm going to find your rock. Ooh, boy. This may be harder than I thought. MARTHA: Is it this one? TRUMAN: Nope. This one? Nope. 

[00:22:37]


This one? Nope. This one? Wait. Let me see! No. (whines) Let's face it. We're never going to find your rock. Now that I think about it, I think I dropped it someplace else. (groans) We should follow our trail back home. It's getting dark. Okay. TRUMAN: I guess I have to face facts. My lucky rock is lost for good. I'm sorry I wasn't able to track it down. (rustling in the bushes) +gasps) Of course! Why didn't I think of it before? Big Minnie! She'll know where your missing rock is. Big Minnie? Who's Big Minnie? A monster, sort of like Bigfoot. She's lives near here. Come on. Let's see if she's seen your rock. Martha, that's not nice! I'm scared enough with bugs. You don't have to make up monsters. Oh, I'm not making it up. Come on. She's not far off. Uh-uh. No way! (rustling in the bushes) Martha?! I wish I had my rock. I wish I had my rock. I wish, I wish, I wish! (gasps) My rock! Just in time! (shrieks) Bug! (rustling in the bushes) (shrieks) Monster! I need my rock. (whines) Okay, you can do it. Show that bug who's boss. Get off! Now! (rustling in the bushes) Shoo! (wings flapping) (sighs happily) (rustling in the bushes) It's okay. I have my rock. My rock will protect me. Oh, hi! Martha, you really scared me. (muffled): Look what I have. What? I said, "Look what I've got." My rock! I forgot I wrote my name on it! Then what's this? 

[00:24:38]


You know what? I scared a bug off this rock all by myself, so I don't need this one at all. I learned a valuable lesson today. You learned that you didn't need your lucky rock after all? Uh-uh. That you're not afraid of bugs? No. I'm terrified of bugs. But that lucky rock didn't help at all. I'll probably always be afraid of bugs. I think that's just how I am. (chuckles) How'd you find my rock anyway? Big Minnie gave it to me. She saw you leave it behind. Cut it out, Martha. Quit trying to scare me! I'm not kidding. She was here. 
?????? La, la, la, la, la ?????? I am not listening to you.    La, la, la, la, la, la, la...    Why doesn't  ??????
anyone ever believe me?! (door squeaks open) Well, I'm all ready for the big game. I just need one more thing. What? What did you misplace now? My baseball. But I haven't misplaced it. "Misplace" means you've lost something. I know exactly where my ball is. I just have to get it. Give me the ball, Skits. (grunts) (quiet bark) Hey, you've got your ball. Yeah, but I've misplaced my dignity. Oh, hi. Welco Hi. Welcome back. Did you catch all of today's words? Why don't you search through them again? These are directions. They tell you how to get where you need to go. I'll lead you. I'll show you how to get there. Follow me! I've located your missing puppy. Located? You mean you've found her? That's exactly what I mean. 

[00:26:40]


She's behind that tree. Bye! See you next time.

>>> Okay. That does it for "the cycle." Martin, it's all yours. 
>> Thank you, s.E. Good afternoon. We begin as rescue crews race against the clock, combing through shredded buildings and shattered homes 24 hours after one of the most destructive tornadoes in u.S. History. Entire neighborhoods are in ruins after the massive twister ripped through mes of oklahoma city and the suburb of moore, leveling everything in its path. Including a hospital and at least two schools. And severe weather is continuing to challenge first responders with rain and hail this afternoon as they search desperately for any survivors who may be trapped in the rubble. Further weather alerts are troubling the region to the south. With a tornado watch in texas, even as we speak. In oklahoma, emergency managers say more than 100 have been found alive, but the time is of the essence. As rescue workers with thermal imaging equipment and dogs sift through crumpled cars and splintered structures. Medical examiners confirm 24 deaths, 9 of them children, and more than 200 injured. Those numbers are, of course, fluid as searchers are ongoing. Oklahoma governor mary fallin spoke to the emotional impact for those facing their worst fears. 
>> It has been a very, very hard experience. A heartbreaking experience. Especially the loss of children and the schools, themselves, and those who haven't been able to find their loved ones and are stale waiting to hear. We frankly don't even know if there are still missing people, but there still may be. 
>> The governor fighting back the tears there. And the federal government is being deployed in the region even as we speak. Earlier today, the president declared a federal disaster in five counties, sending his fema chief to the scene, and he vowed the nation's support for the duration. 
[00:02:11]



>> As a nation, our full focus right now is on the urgent work of rescue and the hard work of recovery and rebuilding that lies ahead. The people of moore should know that their country will remain on the ground there for them, beside them, as long as it takes. 
>> We'll get tour correspondent thomas roberts in a moment, but first, joining us in washington is the former governor of oklahoma, frank keating. Good afternoon, sir. 
>> Martin, how are you? 
>> I'm well. But first, if I might ask, i understand you have family, yourself, in oklahoma city. How are they doing at this time? 
>> Well, you're nice to ask. Of our three children, my wife and I have two that live in oklahoma city and a grandchildren. Six of our ten grandchildren in oklahoma city. Mercifully they are all safe, and both of them who live in oklahoma city have storm cellars thhey installed in their garage, each of them, at a cost of between $4,000 and $6,000. So they took their valuables down to the storm cellar and they were safe and that's certainly good news for all of us. 
>> That's wonderful news for your immediate family, but, sir, I might begin by asking your reaction to the events there yesterday as it relates to others in the city. 
>> Well, of course, on the west coast you have the reality and the threat of earthquakes. On the east east and the gulf of mexico, hurricanes. And the center part of the country we have tornadoes. These last two that have gone through this particular area, the 1999 most powerful winds ever recorded on the face of the earth, and this one, hugely devastating. Between '99 and today, martin, there's been a lot of development in this area. This community is probably 60,000 people of a metro of about 1.25 million. And it's an urban assault by nature. And, of course, going forward i think all of us want to make sure that people are as prepared as they can be. The meteorologists do a great job of warning people. That's in part the reason the death toll is so low. We need to take another look at schools, for example, as shelters in place, facilities. Are those facilities strong enough to withstand very high velocity winds like we've experienced in these two tornadoes? And questions like that will be asked and answered I think it's a very competent leadership team. Quite truthfully, most if not all of them were in place those years ago when we had the 199 9 tornado when I was governor. But it's never nice nor fun to go through something so anguish stricken as this. 
[00:04:58]



>> Can I ask you about the psyche of the people there? You mentioned 1999, the horrendous tornado on may the 3rd. Of course, there were also the oklahoma city bombing. What is the kind of mentality of the people there and their ability to take this kind of devastating impact and rise ain? 
>> Well, you know what's interesting, and I'm not trying to say that only one city or one state 
-- 
>> of course not. 
>> 
-- Have all the virtue. What's interesting, martin, is the oklahoma city bombing, 302 buildings were damaged or destroyed, and there wasn't one act of looting. Here in the tornado experiences, I don't know what this has been like, but law enforcement were always marveling that there were no looting. People literally took off their shoes to share. The bombing, the '99 tornadoes. People are totallymitted to volunteerism and servant leadership and service to their fellows. It's a very believing environment in oklahoma. And really a frontier environment of helping your neighbor build their barn, if you will. And it really is remarkable and it's a great compliment to the people. I just wish the heavens wouldn't open up like this. We love moisture, but not like this. 
>> No, indeed. You are and your family are a great credit to that area. Former governor of oklahoma, frank keating. Thank you, sir. 
>> Thank you, martin. 
>> Msnbc's thomas robert is on the ground in moore, oklahoma. He joins us now. Thomas, first, before we come to the physical devastation, do you whether there are people unaccounted for? 
>> Reporter: We have confirmation at 24. The number given to us throughout the day. 20 being from moore. The area I'm standing in right now. Four from oklahoma city. And out of that ratio, out of that 24, 9 are kids. Most of those kids pulled out of plaza towers elementary school. Martin, I wanted to lead off with this breaking news element I just got in moments ago that i confirmed through our colleague, mike bettes over at the weather channel, that the national weather service which was here today surveying the area for damage most likely will rate this an ef-5 tornado because of the damage that they found in the area. Damage where things sustained winds up to 200 miles per hour. So we're still waiting on the firm survey results, but the confirmation I got from mike bettes at the weather channel is it will with rated an ef-5. That is the highest category that can be given to this tornado. In 1999, we've been talking about that a lot, that was an ef-5. To came through moore at the same time. It caused over 40 deaths. About $1 billion in damage at that time. Now we have the confirmation of at least 24. Martin, you'll recall that number was revised down from earlier reports. It was a lot higher that we had last night. Then early into today. But out of an abundance of caution, they've scaled that number back. We're waiting on more confirmations that will come hopefully later today about where they feel that tally totally stands at this point. But as you can see from the homes behind me, I mean, these are just slabs that remain. We are in the area of southwest 4th and telephone road. You'll hear that intersection discussed a lot in press conferences because this is basically ground zero for where that tornado came through. And this section of the street on southwest 6th where we stand, this side, all the homes are completely leveled. Earlier today, many people were out here in the early morning hours when it was a little sunny, before the rains came in, to come and assess the damage and pick up whatever pieces they could salvage. The rains came in. The winds came in. And it drove people away for a long time. Just a short time ago, maybe about 45 minutes ago, we finally got the nice weather we have now which is supposed to remain. So we might see more people coming back out and taking advantage of the last afternoon hours of daylight. We have some homes across the way over here where people did show up today with tarps and some plywood, but these homes are in much, much better shape than what you're seeing behind me right here. I mean, this is just oelt and utter devastation. And there has been a big push from the american red cross as well as the salvation army dispersing themselves and making themselves well known in the area to try to help out for those that have been displaced. I know on andrea mitchell's show they discussed up to 20,000 people might be homeless right now. 
[00:09:20]



>> And thomas, final question. I understand that in the total area, something like 38,000 people are still without power. And in the areas of moore and oklahoma city, that's 20,000? 
>> Reporter: I'm seeing right now bucket trucks. I don't know if we can 
-- guys, if we cantch this around for martin and show him the bucket trucks that are going up, because they're working aggressively on the electricity in this area. You'll see the bucket trucks are going up. That's the hospital area in the background that totally looks like it was bombed out. But they're working aggressively to try to get some of the power back on in this area. This, again, martin, was the hardest hit area for the storm in and of itself because as you can see, across the street it's much more of a commercial area. We're standing more on the residential side. And we just saw in about an hour ago, too, there was a group, a choreographed group of hazmat workers, fema representatives and first responders that were walking this area with service dogs. They were checking it out. We were told from the very start of our day here, because there is a very strong smell of gas, to be very careful. Not be move around a lot. Because they just couldn't, you know, they couldn't say, clear our safety, but they still let us in because they know we need to talk about this story and cover this story. But told us to be, you know, cautious. So they came in today with their service dogs and were walking, working through. So there's still so much that people are still trying to assess. Not only from the people that live in and around this area, their loved ones, but just for the, you know, first responders still ing to do so much work, so much dangerous work when it comes to making sure that this area completely safe. But we're seeing someof those signs as you point out ask about electricities. They're getting the power trucks out to work on the lines to rectify that as quickly as possible. 
>> Thomas roberts. My colleague. Thank you. Tom, we really appreciate your reporting. Thank you. 
[00:11:23]



>> Reporter: Sure thing, martin. 
>>> Coming up, more on new severe weather in the forecast right now.

>>> As oklahoma struggles to find survivors and begins recovery from a horrific tornado monday afternoon, a tornado watch is in effect for a massive swath of texas. Where right now forecasters are warning of the greatest risk of damaging storms which may include the dallas-ft. Worth area. Let's get right to meteorologist chris warren from the weather channel in atlanta. And chris, what can you tell us about these latest severe weather threats? 
>> Well, right now it is starting to ramp up so we're seeing an increase in the storms. I'm going to show you where the storms are right now. First give you an overall look at where the threat is. So this is a look in the red where tornado watches are currently in effect. So that means conditions are favorable for the development of tornadoes. And in dallas, that goes until 7:00. And we can see this moves farther to the east with that threat until 10:00. This does include shreveport, also texarkana. Then a chance for some tornadoes also in northern mississippi, parts of western tennessee. And that does include memphis. Until 10:00. Parts of southeastern oklahoma, severe thunderstorm watch still in effect until 7:00. So now is a look at where the storms are right now. And you can see here in dallas, there's this line. Once this gets through, that threat for tornadoes will diminish in a hurry. It will diminish in a big way because cooler air will move in. These green outlined areas is a threat for flash flooding. Getting clearing out here in oklahoma city. That's good news for the rescue and recovery efforts going on there in moore. Meanwhile, seeing more of the storms firing right now in little rock. Putting on the lightning now, regardless of whether or not we get damaging winds or tornadoes, there is a lot of lightning associated with these storms. So that is a big danger you have to watch out for if you plans were to be outside. Parts of northern and eastern dallas under that severe thunderstorm warning right now. That means these conditions, the strong winds, possibly large hail, currently in effect. That is going on right now. But, again, once that gets through, cooler air moves in. And that threat for tornadoes will diminish. Again, no tornado warnings right now. Just the threat for some of these stronger storms that we're dealing with. And right now we to have some storms that are getting closer to memphis. We're keeping a close eye on that. You can see some stronger storms. This is the threat going forward for tonight. So we still have that threat for dallas. It goes from san antonio all the way up to nashville and cincinnati. And looking ahead to that threat for some of that heavy rain and some flooding. Mainly here in arkansas, but notice much drier through thursday here in oklahoma. Now, there will, however, still be that threat of seeing a few storms pop up later in the morning on thursday. Then again friday and saturday. But for tomorrow, it does look like temperatures will warm up. So it will be warm for the rescue crews and recovery crews there on wednesday. South of oklahoma city in moore. But, again, that threat for some storms, martin, will return by the middle to the end of the week. But it will be much more isolated and much more of a popup in nature situation.

>> Wther channel's chris warren there with a comprehensive forecast. Thank you, sir. 
>>> Now we want to bring in by phone juston drake, a storm chaser currently featured on the weather channel show "storm riders." Juston, can I ask where exactly you are? What are you following? 
>> Right now we're on the leading edge of a squall line. We're in texas. We're getting very heavy rains in our location and very strong winds. 
>> And how does this storm at this stage compare with what happened at this time yesterday in oklahoma? 
>> Well yesterday in oklahoma it was a super cell thunderstorm that was very discreet. It was by itself and produced a very violent tornado. What we're chasing right now and what we're under is a squall line. The tornado potential with it right now is nowhere near as high as the super cell that caused that big tornado. Right now the main threat in our location is just some very high winds, heavy rain, and maybe some small hail. 
>> And how close were you or how close arou to this storm? 
>> Well right now we're directly under the squall line. We're getting beat down by very heavy rains. It's hard for simon to drive the car right now because we keep getting thrown around and there's also some very r heavy rain. And the water on the road is starting to cause us to hydroplane a little bit.

>>> from the moment the devastating tornado touched down in moore, oklahoma, monday afternoon, there were chilling reminders of another storm. Time lapse video of yesterday's twister showing a similar path to an ef-5 tornado that ravaged oklahoma and kansas over a decade THE DATE, MAY 3rd, 1999, LIVES In infamy for the region. The "oklahomaen" front page tragically suggests this storm was even worse. Joining us now, my colleague milissa rehberger who covered the storm in 1999. You were with us yesterday and helpfully covered our breaking news of this storm. 24 hours later, what's your assessment of how yesterday compares with that brutal tornado in 1999? 
>> Well, I think we're going to find the experts talking about, you know, which one was bigger, which one was more powerful? It has now been called an ef-5 for sure. Thomas roberts reporting that earlier. It looks exactly the same as what I saw then. The difference that I really see is that, unfortunately, it hit that hospital. Thank god the patients were safe, but they were put i imminent danger. And the two schools. Last time around I recall seeing more residences. And I think the devastation I'm seeing her is exactly the same, but I think just more of it. 
[00:24:12]



>> And at this stage, there appear to be fewer fatalities when compared with 1999. Yet the physical devastation, that seems somehow worse. 
>> You know, it does. Let's hope those numbers hold up. I mean, I certainly do. Martin, the thing that I'm thinking is 
-- 
>> well, just to let you know, milissa, we're hearing from fire chief gary byrd. He's saying he's 98% sure that there are no more survivors or bodies under the rubble. 98% sure. 
>> Well, I tell you what, that is wonderful news. And here is a possible reason why. In may 3rd of 1999, it happened in the evening, and this is a residential area for the most part. You can see that that's a sprawling suburb. It's a subdivision. It happened in the evening when people were typically at home. This happened in the afternoon where a lot of those people had computed to work in places like oklahoma city which fortunately did not get hit and fortunately hose people were hopefully out of harm's way during their work day. Yesterday as you recall, we saw that huge line of traffic that police were desperately trying to get them to turn around. It's probably those people who lived there and was trying to get home and see what was left. 
>> Also governor keating, the former governor of oklahoma who I was describing to moments ago was describing the outlook of the people of that area and d 
-- 
>> it's the whole state. Yes, they're very strong resilient people. We keep using the word resilient. It's very, very true. These are hardworking people who value family, god and community. They're a community already. They don't need a tragedy to pull them together. They treat each other well in general. And in general, the state, you know, when I was living there, they asked me where do i worship? Would you like to come? They enjoy getting to know people. It's a very tight community. And I know that we say that in times of trouble, but this is true of oklahoma. Basically all the time. The governor was absolutely right. My, what I witnessed in the past, I agree with him. I di see one instant of looting. I saw completely the opposite. As I mentioned yesterday, you had local businesses, you know, keeping their doors open, feeding people, literally driving around in cars with hot meals for the rescuers, the volunteers. And the people who live there and were picking through the rubble of their houses trying to find something and may not have had a warm meal to eat or water to drink. The shelters remainedopen. One thing I think that we can look forward to is, you know, right now the phones are probably still clogged up. A lot of people might be considered missing because their relatives know they live ithat area and haven't heard from them. So hopefully we'll get some good news in the next couple of days as they get back in touch with their friends and loved ones. 
[00:26:57]



>> As you mentioned, the life church, one of the largest evangelical congregations in the country is taking in supplies for the purpose of donating them to anybody who needs them. Milissa rehberger, thank you. 
>>> Coming up, too many heroes to count. Now an outpouring of support for the residents of oklahoma. It is are much the american way. Stay with us. I' sorry loss. Still doesn't feel real.

>>> A city devastated, a state once again cleaning up. And now a nation pulling together. It's been some 24 hours since the tornado struck. 
>> Huge swath of tornado alley is bracing for another day of severe storms. 
>> This is definitely something that you need to be aware of. 
>> It is a giant barrel with a massive debris cloud. 
>> Major, major, major wedge on the ground. 
>> Over one mile wide at its base. 
>> It's still grinding. Still on the ground. 
>> This storm is seen as either an e-4 or e-5. Likely an e-5. 
>> All the memories coming back today of 1999. 
>> Certainly hundreds of people that have lost their homes or are trapped. 
>> I don't know how to explain it, how to describe it. 
>> An enormous, perhaps historic path of destruction. 
>> Today's track is basically about 20 miles long. 
>> Total devastation out here. 
>> Of course the unfortunate part is that there's so much more population since there was in 1999. 
>> This is about the worst damage I've ever seen. 
>> Including two elementary schools. 
>> Can only pray for the families as they search for these kids. 
>> A sixth grade teacher had taken some students into the bathroom and jumped over top of them as the storm went across. 
>> It is a chaotic scene. 
>> Just a trail of destruction. 
>> This is the worst tornado damage-wise in the history of the world. 
>> Let's get right to chris jansing, host of "jansing and company" and my colleague on msnbc. Chris, a local reporter speaking on our air described the scene as something akin to a war zone. Can you give us a sense of what it's like as you walk around such devastation? 
[00:32:10]



>> Reporter: I think that's an apt description. I thought it looked like the set for an apocalyptic movie. It's the vastness of it in addition to the absolute destruction. Look, just look behind me. I mean, there's nothing. This was a garage. It was a house. This was a whole subdivision here. And it's just wiped out. It's gone. And we just saw a second pass of crews going through just making absolute sure, as the governor promised they would, that there was absolutely no signs of life. The houses across the street from here, although they're ly uninhabitable and almost destroyed, they have walls standing. We've seen people going through them. As I was down the block, martin, talking to a young man and his father about their home, it wasn't even surprising they were able to find a few photographs. What is surprising was they found anything that was theirs. I mean, stuff just traveled so far, and in fact, right across the street is the medical center, and there's a car on the roof. It's hard for me to judge. It's maybe five stories high. And there have beenome 
-- well, there's a helicopter going up there now. But anyway, a car that actually ma its way to the roof. Oh, that's the military chopper. Of the medical center. So, yeah, I think a war zone very much describes it. And for a lot of people, as horrifying as this loss of life is, they know from experience here it could have been a lot worse, frankly, martin. 
>> Right. Chris, rescuers have pulled over 100 people from the wreckage. Are they still pulling people out right now? Because there was some suggestion earlier today that there may have been some children who are unaccounted for at this time. 
>> Reporter: Well, I think there's always a chaotic situation in the hours after something like this. And, you know, they put lists together of people who are reported to be missing. Sometimes it doesn't get reported that either someone was found or they're being looked for by someone who simply doesn't know where they are. There is a general feeling that they have sort of looked everywhere they're going to look. They've checked the list. And they feel pretty confident that where they are is where they're going to be. Having said that, they also know that in situations like this, and when you're looking at the breadth of destruction we see here, it is possible that someone might still be trapped. It is possible that they could still recover a body. So the governor has promised she will leave no piece of debris unturned which is why they're making three passes. Not one or two. But there will be a third pass of these experts, these rescue experts going through and looking through these neighborhoods and making sure they've seen everything they can see. I can tell you at that house down the block, they found a dog who was hovering in a car buried somewhat under a load of bricks. And some buddies of the guy who lived there who was too upset to go back and look, himself, were able to find the dog. So not exactly the same thing as a recovering someone who is buried, but they know that those possibilities are there. So that's why they're making sure, triple sure, that they've checked everything, martin. 
[00:35:22]



>> Yeah. That's an encouraging story, regardless. According to the "associated press," firefighters from more than a dozen fire departments have come to lend their hand to the people of moore. And tonight they're expecting a team of rescuers to arrive from joplin, missouri. Is that right? 
>> Reporter: That's right. As you know, that was the site of another devastating tornado. And these are people who ar extremepert at what they do. One of the things that has really given, had heartened people and also amazed people who have covered many of these, or who have, unfortunately, been volunteers in many of these is the response. In the first hours, the number of people who came, the crews who came in to search and rescue, the various organizations that come in to help people. Even we're starting to see the influx of insurance companies and other organizations to help the people who have lost so much, have come so quickly and so well prepared. Part of it is technology. Part of it is we've seen fema people going around with ipads getting paperwork started for people. Part of it is technology. Also I think it is something that is so uniquely american in many ways, the way people respond in times of tragedy. They do it quickly, they do it selflessly. Often as it was last night when they rescue the 100-plus people, they do it at great risks to themselves, martin. 
>> My colleague, chris jansing. Thank you for your reporting. 
>>> Let's turn now to dr. Irwin redlener, pediatrician and director at columbia university. Sir, we saw yesterday that the two schools were hit and we now know nine children have died there amongst the total of 24. So far. What about those children who survived such an incident? 
>> Well, we're going to have quite a few problems that have to do with children in the aftermath of a disaster like this. There's a tremendous need right now for something we call psychological first aid to help these children cope with this extraordinary trauma. This won't end in days or weeks or probably months, and maybe for some children we're talking about years of memories and of tragedy and of absolute destruction. And it is really important that we have the mechanisms and the organizations in place to really help these children and families get through what they're going to need to get through now. Part of it is having a resilient family and one adult who's really helping to buffer some of this trauma the kids have gone through. Parent of it is to try to get these children back to some sense of normalcy as quickly as possible. And obviously under circumstances like we're seeing in moore, it's going to take a long time for people to get back to a recovery phase where it will look anything like the normal that they had been used to. So lots of challenges now going forward. 
[00:38:16]



>> Craig fugate, the head of fema, who's down there, traveled immediately, dispatched by the president, he remarked about how effective the public service advice had been taken, deployed and taken onboard by people in the locality. And, of course, this area SUFFERED ON MAY 3rd, 1999, A Similar event. How well prepared can any area of the nation be for something like this? 
>> Well, first of all, the force of this particular tornado was beyond anything that most people have ever experienced. 
>> It's just been upgraded to an ef-5. 
>> Right. There's nothing really you can do to protect the actual physical structures in the homes and so forth. I think one of the questions, though, that will be asked is, was there enough done to make sure that people, not the structures, but people had safe places to go? And I particularly am interested in what the analysis is going to show about the level of preparedness in the schools, martin. Because these areas where there are lots of children, children are very different than adults. They need different kinds of responses. They can't think or act for themselves. They need adults around them. They really need the safety of safe rooms that I don't think were necessarily in place in the schools that were affected. This is, you know, potentially something of great interest because the community, as you pointed out, has been through this before and you would think that those wake-up calls in '93, in 2003, would at the very least compel communities a governments to make sure that the schools, daycare centers and so forth where there are lots of children have very safe places that allow children to survive. Even a tornado like this. So we're going to be asking those questions in the days and weeks to come now. 
>> In terms of the construction of buildings, is there some suggestion that many of these buildings were inappropriate in an area where such aggressive tornadoes have come and were expected to come? 
>> You know, so many parts of the country are living under some kind of risk. If you're in the gulf, you're worried about hurricanes. If you're in the northeast, you're worried about hurricanes as we found out with superstorm sandy. There are people living on seismically active zones in the middle of the country, the west coast, and so forth. And I think the responsible thing that we need to do is to understand what needs to be done to make sure whatever risks you are facing can be mitigated. But that requires investments, and you know, lately we're not very good at making investments. Whether it's the infrastructure, dealing with climate change or whatever, or disaster preparedness. The fact is we've actually seen about a 50% to 60% cutback in disaster preparedness funding for communities and states from dollars that are coming from the federal government. So we have a lot of work to do. This is, again, a wake-up call. I hope it doesn't turn into a snooze alarm. You know, where we're excited and obviously concerned about the high drama of this event and that we don't just fall back into a state of complacency in the next weeks. But we really have to stay with this and make sure that never again will we leave schoolchildren in environments that are not as fully and completely protective of them as possible. 
[00:41:28]



>> Dr. Irwin redlener of columbia university, sir, thank you so much. 
>> You're welcome. 
>>> Let's turn now to dan halliburton, a spokesman 
-- sorry, no. I'm so sorry. He will be with us in a moment. So do stay with us. We'll have someone from the red cross in a moment. 
>>> For all those who have been affected, we recognize that you face a long road ahead. In some cases, there will be enormous grief that has to be absorbed, but you will not travel that path alone. Your country will travel it with you, fueled by our faith in the almighty and our faith in one another. So our prayers are with the people of oklahoma today. And we will back up those prayers with deeds for as long as it takes. Thank you very much. me diabetes, I remember thinking there's a lot I have to do... check my blood sugar, eat better.

>>> Now to the white house and the president, accompanied by the vice president and his secretary of homeland security, assured those hardest hit by this devastation that their country would stand with them in their time of need. 
>> The people of moore should know that their country will remain on the ground there for them, beside them, as long as it takes. For there are homes and schools to rebuild. Businesses and hospitals to re-open. There are parents to console. First responders to comfort. And, of course, frightened children who will need our continued love and attention. 
>> For more now, let's bring in nbc's kristen welker who's at the white house. Kristen, you were there at the white house as the president offered those words of comfort and support. Is there any suggestion that he may travel, himself, to oklahoma, to witness the devastation for himself? 
[00:46:29]



>> Reporter: Well, martin, the white house is being mum on that point right now, but I would be surpsed if president obama doesn't travel to oklahoma. We have, of course, seen him take that course in the past in the wake of such tragedies. Particularly aer the boston bombings. Also recently after the plant fire in west, texas. The newtown shooting. This is when president obama really takes on the role of comforter in chief. We heard him really strike that tone during those comments that you just played. And he's doing that behind the scenes by reaching out to state and local officials. He called the mayor of moore. He also called the governor of oklahoma, mary fallin, last night, to offer his condolences, his prayers, but also to make it clear that the federal government plans to put its full weight behind helping in the assistance and recovery efforts. So I would be surprised if he doesn't make that trip. 
>> Now, kristen, the president dispatched fema chief craig fugate almost immediately, but there's also been some talk of whether oklahoma's disaster relief should be offset by cuts elsewhere in the federal budget. I'm sorry to raise this issue on a day like this, but is the white house expecting a similar fight to that which occurred following hurricane sandy? 
>> Reporter: Well, they got questions about this today during the briefing. White house press secretary asked if he has an opinion about this. His response was, look, fema has enough funding in the immediate future, so he wouldn't weigh in on that debate looking forward. But we are already hearing from some republicans, tom coburn of oklahoma, or rather of 
-- tom coburn, rather, who said he does think those types of funds should be offset. So this is a debate and this is a discussion that has already started. That has already been set in motion, martin. So I would be surprised if we didn't see this, and, of course, that was the debate during the issue over whether or not there should be sandy funding approved. 
[00:48:30]



>> Of course. Nbc's kristen welker at the white house. Thank you, kristen. 
>> Reporter: Thank you. 
>>> Now to the task for the red cross leading the recovery efforts in moore, oklahoma, and this critical work comes on an anniversary for this invaluable group. Let's turn no halliburton, spokesperson for the american red cross who joins us from oklahoma. The red cross, as you know, sir, was actually founded on this very day may the 21st back in 1881. It is somewhat fitting, I guess, that you face the task that you do on this day. 
>> It is. And I checked mendar for a lot of things today but missed that one. Thanks for pointing it out. It is a source of pride for all of us involved in the red cross. 
>> Indeed. Now, there waphoto tweeted out today of the oklahoma city office of the red cross. And, of course, there's a massive crowd of people showing up. There it is. To lend their hand to help. How long do you think the red cross will remain in moore? How long do you anticipate it will take for this community to be whole again? 
>> Well, we're early on when communities like this need help, and that's really the first line that the red cross is responsible for. So you see us early, but we stay here for a good long time. We start out with our sheltering operations. Then we work to take care of first responders as they first come into the neighborhoods. Later we work with our partners and come into the neighborhoods and start feeding and providing supplies and services to the people who are here to clean up their neighborhood. And then we work a lot of other partners for that longer term recovery. And it really is a great mesh of many organizations and the red cross is proud to take an important lead in it. 
>> Now, there's been an incredible outpouring of support from many people. That includes, of course, a check for $1 million to the american red cross. Written out by nba star kevin durant. We have information 
-- 
[00:50:32]



>> wow. 
>> 
-- On how viewers can also contribute to the red cross. What's your message for people, ordinary citizens of this nation who may want to partner and assist those in great need in oklahoma? 
>> Well, you may not have $1 million in your checking account, but a lot of folks have a cell phone and a really easy way to make just a $10 donation is to text the word "red cross" to 90999. Just a $10 donation. Super easy. Really fast. And you know that that money is going to work right away to help out the people here in moore and all over the united states. We've had a lot of tough challenges whether-wise and otherwise around the state, and the red cross has been at all of them. 
>> Indeed it has. And do you share the view of craig fugate that even though people may be well intentioned, may want to provide any kind of help, that actually driving to the area is not the most helpful thing to do? Bringing food and supplies also not the most helpful thing to do? 
>> Yeah, one of the great things about the way the red cross works, those donations we get allow us to buy the materials we need right here in moore or in other cities and they're all a little bit different. And we know people want to do something right away. You know, I've seen people come in with a trailer of water and, you know, soft drinks and milk and orange juice. What do we do with that? How you have to store it and do other things. It really helps if you can make the financial donations.

On, we're able to get people to understand that the threat level is high and hopefully when that happens, they're better prepared when the actual day comes. 
>> Thank you very mitch. A pleasure to have you on to get insight into where we're going as far as technology to hopefully save lives in the future. Thank you. 
>>> And still ahead, a live report from the white house as the administration continues to react to the tragedy in oklahoma. And ahead, jodi arias takes the stand in the death penalty phase of her trial. She pleads for her life, telling jurors she can contribute to society from prison if she's allowed to live.

>>> earlier, president obama told the victims in oklahoma today the federal government is ready to provide assistance. The president has been getting regular updates from officials on the ground in the past 24 hours. Nbc white house correspondent peter alexander is at the white house. We know it started with a phone call the president had with the governor of oklahoma last night and his updates have continued. We don't know if the president will be visitg that region as the recovery effort continues there, right? 
>> That's a good question. I walked out of the press briefing with jay carney only a short time ago. The first question out of the gates is whether or not the president would travel to oklahoma. And as it is clear from the white house at this point, that decision has not yet been made. In situs like this, it's always their top priority not to drain resources away from the relief efforts taking place, but precedent would suggest he would travel. I was checking back in our archives, and in 1999 when moore, oklahoma, was hit, it was five days before then-president bill clinton traveled to oklahoma. It remains to be seen what will happen. We use the language major disaster declaration which president obama has approved. I want to explain what that means. It includes individual assistance and public assistance to pay for things like debris removal and the like and also tamron, we know the homeland security secretary janet napolitano will travel to the region tomorrow. 
>> Thank you very much, peter. Before we let you go, we have another update and a preliminary report from the national weather service says the tornado that ravaged moore was an ef-4, winds of 190 miles per hour. The damage, 17 miles wide. So the preliminary report indicating that this was an ef-4 with 190-mile-per-hour winds. That certainly could change, but right now, that's the information we're getting in. As far as fatalities, the confirmed number is at 24. And we will continue to update you, our continued coverage out of moore, oklahoma. The devastation there, but the brave effort to find any survivors and to continue to help those folks. That does it for this edition of newsnation. I'm tamron hall. The cycle is up next. From home repair to healthcare written by people just like you.

[00:06:32]



[ Male Announcer ] TODAY, MEN WITH LOW T Have androgel 1.62% testosterone gel. The #1 prescribed topical testosterone replacement therapy increases testosterone when used daily. Women and children should avoid contact with application sites. Discontinue androgel and call your doctor if you see unexpected signs of early puberty in a child, or signs in a woman, which may include changes in body hair or a large increase in acne, possibly due to accidental exposure. Men with breast cancer or who have or might have prostate cancer, and women who are or may become pregnant or are breast-feeding, should not use androgel. Serious side effects include worsening of an enlarged prostate, possible increased risk of prostate cancer, lower sperm count, swelling of ankles, feet, or body, enlarged or painful breasts, problems breathing during sleep, and blood clots in the legs. Tell your doctor about your medical conditions and medications, especially insulin, corticosteroids, or medicines to decrease blood clotting. In a clinical study, over 80% of treated men had their t levels restored to normal. Talk to your doctor about all your symptoms. Get the blood tests. Change your number. Turn it up. Androgel 1.62%. were jobs available out there. I knew DeVry university would give me the skills that I needed to make one of those tech jobs mine.

=======================================================


>>> Hello. Welcome to "newsline." I'm catherine kobayashi in t tokyo. Here is a look at some of the stories we're following at this hour. Searchers are looking for survivors after a tornado rips through the state of oklahoma. 
>>> Apple is defending the company against congre. Congress says they avoided paying billions in taxes. 
>>> And a less painful way of taking blood samples. Using needles inspired by nature. 
>>> Authorities in oklahoma are trying to determine the extent of damage after tornadoes swept through parts of the u.S. State. They confirmed 24 people hurt and 237 injured. Rescue workers are going through buildings as they search for survivors. 
>> We're in it right now! Stop! Stop! 
>> The tornado churned through the oklahoma city on monday. The winds reached more than 300 kilometers per hour. The storm swept along a path up to two kilometers wide and nearly 30 kilometers long. It took homes off their foundations and blew them away. Analysts with the national weather service gave the storm their highest rating on the international tornado ale. 
>> I heard the roar of it coming. I grabbed my dog and laid down in the closet. Everything collapsed around us. 
>> State officials said the tornado disrupted communications and made it difficult to confirm the number of deaths. They now say at least 24 people were killed, including nine children. Police officers and firefighters are checking evacuation centers. To confirm thoseissing. 
[00:02:16]



>> I have never been involved with anything like this before. 
>> Residents of oklahoma are used to seeing tornadoes, but an authority said two elementary schools that took direct hits did not have storm shelters. U.S. President barack obama declared moore, oklahoma a disaster area. 
>> As a nation, our focus right now is on the urgent work of rescue and the hard work of recovery and rebuilding. 
>> Obama told secretary of homeland security janet napolitano to get everything oklahoma needs right away. He said authorities don't know the full extent of the damage. He reassured residents that other americans are there to help. 
>>> President obama is making plans to host chinese president xi jinping. Next month xi will make his first visit to the u.S. Since he took office in march. Chinese foreign minister yi said the two will try to come to an agreement. 
>> Translator: It is important for the countries to keep the peace on the korean peninsula. 
>> He emphasized on the role of the tensions on the korean peninsula. Xi and obama will meet in the city of rancho mirage, california. Wang said the leaders will discuss issues of mutual interest. 
>>> Last month, officials postponed the test launch of a missile. They delayed it again. They wanted to make sure the equipment is safe. Air force personnel were to launch the inter continental missile from a base in california. Now they will fire it off some time wednesday. They plan to send it about 7,000 kilometers to a target near the marshall islands in the pacific ocean. 
[00:04:27]



>>> Ceo tim cook rejected claims his company used an overseas facility to avoid paying taxes. 
>> We pay every dollar we owe. We comply with the laws. We comply with the spirit of the laws. 
>> Congressional investigators said apple used subsidiaries in ireland as tax shelters. He said apple's overseas profits are not subject to u.S. Taxes because they are earned in other countries. He said apple's executives have no intention of repatrioting the earnings. He called on senators to lower taxes. Committee members said in a report that apple avoided paying taxes on more than $100 million by keeping it out of the country. Apple is the latest in a series of companies targeted for tax practices. Critics say these businesses channel profits to countries with lower tax rates to avoid higher rates in their home countries. 
>>> Japanese exporters did more business with americans, but less with europeans. Ai uchida joins us now from the business desk. 
>> It was another month of trade deficit. This is mainly due to higher costs of fuel imports as the yen has continued to weaken. Finance ministry officials said the trade deficit came to ab880 billion yen or $8.6 billion. Exports rose 3.8% from a year earlier in yen terms. That's up for a second month. Exports to the u.S. Were up by almost 15%. Helped by solid auto shipments to the country. Exports to china were slightly higher by 0.3%. Reversing the downward trend in the previous two months. Exports to the eu extended declines and were down 3.5%. Imports rose 9.4%. A major factor is the sharp increase in the yen cost for liquified natural gas stemming from the recent decline. 
[00:07:04]



>>> Now time for a check on the markets. Stocks are trading higher following a record high close on the dow jones industrial average. It is trading at 15,548. That is a gain of more than 1% from tuesday's close. Major issues are providing a boost to the index.

Kospi is higher by .50 at 1,990. In shanghai, the index is trading at 2,299. 
>>> U.S. Justice department officials say more executives from japan have pleaded guilty to price fixing. The case involves a number of japanese auto parts makers. The officials said two executives of denso corporation submitted to over a year of incarceration each. They have to pay some $20,000 in penalties. The executives violated a u.S. Anti-trust law over sales of electronic controllers and other auto parts. Denso's top leaders admitted the involvement in the price fixing last year. The company will pay $78 million in fines. Justice department officials are continuing the investigation. 14 members from firms have pleaded guilty or are prepared to do so. Most have been handed jail terms up to two years. The total fines will exceed $800 million. 
[00:09:15]



>>> Two of japan's energy companies are in the final stages of talks to jointly build a thermal power plant. Officials at tokyo electric power company and chubu electric power company will sell power across the service areas. That's a rare move for japanese power companies under strict regulations. The 600,000 kilowatt coal-fire generator will be built in the tepco compound north of tokyo. They will sell 70% in the tokyo area. The remaining will be sold by chubu electric. 
>>> Here is a bit of relief for people who are uneasy with the idea of injections. A new type of needle has been devised that makes the piercing of skin virtually painless. The needle is gaining popularity add medical institutions around japan. It is made from a renewable resource. 
>> Reporter: Thiis a hospital in tokyo. Takas hi has diabetes. He needs to have his blood sugar levels checked every day. That means about three needles a day. It's eight for some patients. He wanted to get rid of the pain and stress, so he tried a new type of needle. 
>> Translator: It doesn't hurt. It's good. It's a hassle having to do it a few times a day. This needle doesn't make me feel stressed like usual. 
>> Reporter: The needle is just 0.9 millimeters long. It was put on to the market about a year ago. A venture firm founded ten years ago developed the needle. Mitso is the president. He spent 30 years working in marketing and sales at medical equipment makers. He was often close to patients. 
[00:11:26]



>> Translator: I was visiting hospitals every day. Children burst out crying. Even grown ups got upset. I thought I could do something about it. 
>> Reporter: He looked to nature for inspiration. He studied things like rose thorns. Then he turned his eye to the mosquito. Mosquitoes can penetrate the human skin without causing pain. The tip of the mosquito is serrated. This makes penetration less painful. In regular needles, a larger section comes in contact with the skin. This causes more friction, which creates more pain. But with serrated needles, only the tips come in contact with the skin. That means a smaller area of friction. It took him ten years to develop the 0.9 millimeter long needing with serrated tip and put it in mass production. He took notice of the flexibility of the mosquito. It's made of a flexible resin. This helps it move between tissue. The flexibility helps reduce pain as well. He used polylactic acid for similar flexibility. It is a resin that can be derived from corn. It's flexible and resistant to breaking. This material is absorbed into the system and causes no harm even if it remains inside the body. That's why he chose the resin. He is now trying to apply the same technology to needles for vaccinations. 
>> Translator: I hope this technology will make services worldwide less stressful for patients. I hope people will be encouraged to go for tests so any illnesses will be found earlier. That will lead to faster cures. 
[00:13:46]



>> Reporter: Fukuda looks at medical technology from a patient's perspective. He is always searching for the next challenge. 
>> U.S. Authorities approved the painless needle in february. They want to ensure a stable supply in the u.S. And start selling worldwide. 
>> I'll have more business for you next hour. For now, I'll leave you with a check on the markets. 
>>> Religious leaders in iran have barred a former president from running for election. Some see rajani as a setback. The council of the scholars vetted more than 600 people who declared candidacy for the next month. They chose eight for devotion for islam. Top negotiators find them among the ones who made the cut. Former vice president made the list too. He will carry the aspirations of voters wanting change. Some hoped that rajani will seek relations are the west. The scholars also admitted one from the list. President mahmoud ahmadinejad had hand picked his close aide for the post, but the president is said to be at odds with the supreme leader ayatollah khom khomeini. 
[00:15:58]



>>> Syrian military commanders have acknowledged something for the first time. They say their troops attacked israeli soldiers in the golan heights. The syrians say they destroyed an army vehicle that had crossed into their territory. The israelis say they were on their side of the cease-fire line between the two countries. They say their vehicle was damaged, not destroyed. They say no one was hurt. They fired back with anti-tank missiles. Israeli forces made frequent reports of gunfire coming from across the border. Syrian commanders did not admit to targeting them. E attack followed israeli air strikes earlier this month in the syrian capital of damascus. Syrian leaders threatened to retaliate for those strikes. 
>>> Africa. A continent of promise and plunder. More than a billion people. Many live in lands rich in minerals. "Newsline" is looking at the challenges and opportunities on this continent in the lead up to the conference in tokyo. Don't miss our coverage starting ON MAY 27th. 
>>> A small airline company in the south pacific has gone where no other airliners have dared to go. It is charging passengers by how much they weigh. Officials at samoa air have taken the measure to use the limited space better. With samoas getting heavier, the system is getting a lot of attention at home and abroad. Nhk world has the story. 
>> Reporter: Passengers who are preparing to fly out of samoa's capital airport must go through an unusual procedure. Now I will check in for the flight. How much do I have to pay? 116. 
[00:18:08]



>> Reporter: In the pay as you weigh system, a passenger pays more or less. Depending on their weight. Each kilo costs about 70 cents. 103. I think I weigh more when i was 
-- it seems I dropped a lot of weight now. 
>> Reporter: The airline had several small planes that connect the outer islands and neighboring countries. Chris is the chief executive officer and a pilot. He introduced the weight system because he wanted to make better use of the plane's load capacity. 
>> The initial reaction to the sort of concept is it discriminates against people who are for whatever reason are heavy. We have a system that is the fairest. We provide information to let them know this brings the air fare down. We can be much more efficient. 
>> Reporter: The new system has shed light on the obesity problem in the country. According to the world health organization, more than 80% of the population is overweight. Experts point to the eating habits of the islanders as one ofhe problems. Popular items include fried meat and buns and fried chicken. All available at reasonable prices. Steps have been taken in recent years to combat the issue. Officials have been promoting dance-based classes in the country. People move their bodies to the rhythm of music just like in aerobics. 
>> I am starting to see a difference. 250 pounds. Now 182. 
[00:20:17]



>> Reporter: Volleyball competitions are also held on weekends from teams from different villages. Awards are presented to the winners as an incentive to lose weight. 
>> By doing the activities and help to move their bodies and have them improve their health. 
>> Reporter: Samoa air says the response has been generally favorable to the weight-based fare system. They received inquiries from people and airlines around the world. 
>> We know that worldwide the level of obesity has increased. So it's a social issue which is now out there. So people are less worried about declaring their weight. 
>> Reporter: Samoa air is a small airline, but it has taken on a big problem and it is being closely watched by airlines around the world which are seeking to make better use of the available space in their planes. Reporting for nhk world, samoa. 
>>> The world's tallest tower is marking its first anniversary. The tokyo skytree has attracted millions. It's broken pre-opening estimates. The landmark stands 634 meters high. More than 6.3 million people have taken in the views over the past year. That is 20% higher than the operators expected. Crowds formed long lines during the holiday week this month. Some people waited six and a half hours for the ride to the observation deck. It is established as a popular tourist destination. The skytree and the complex has attracted over 50 million people. People looking out from the observation deck are getting a good view today. It is sunny and warm here in tokyo. Meteorologist sayaka mori has the world weather. 
[00:22:49]



>> Hello, there. Summer-like conditions. The highs could rise to over 30 degrees in places, mainly in inland areas. The reason for that is nice southerly winds and plenty of sunshine. Dry weather for the korean peninsula as well, but heavy rain is still coming down in the southern end of china. This is the picture coming out of guandong province. Downpours on tuesday have triggered widespread flooding. The water flooded many roads and houses. Tobacco is a main cash crop in the area. Two-thirds of the fields in the area are water logged. Unfortunately, an additional 50 millimeters likely to fall in the province in the next 24 hours. Rain will not be too heavy, but the ground is saturated and additional rain could worsen the situation. The same frontal system is affecting taiwan and the southwestern islands of japan. Heavy thundershowers for the indochina peninsula. Temperatures in hot in bangkok. 35 degrees. Same for chongqing. The heat will continue for the rest of the workweek in parts of china. 35 in chongqing on thursday. 34 degrees in changsha. Keep hydrated to avoid heat stroke. In north america, these are the clouds which caused about 50 tornadoes, including the one in oklahoma. The southern half of the plains is usually called tornado alley because many tornadoes hit this area every year. 155 tornadoes in texas, 62 tornadoes in oklahoma a year. It looks like the system is still with you affecting the same area. The reason is that three different winds are crashing into each other. Warm and humid air from the gulf of mexico, dry and hot air from the southwest and cooler air from canada. All of the winds are crashing into each other and creating an ongoing severe weather from texas into the lower mississippi valley. Not just tornadoes. We are expecting strong gusts with 110 kilometers per hour and golf-ball sized hail and drenching rain. As we go into wednesday, the hardest hit area in the great lakes region and the tennessee valley. Some tornadoes are likely, however, the main threats are going to be large hail and damaging winds. Out to the west, a new system is affecting the northwest. Producing persistent gray skies and cooler than average temperatures from vancouver british columbia to the northern california coastline. Temperatures will be chilling down to 13 degrees in vancouver. 14 degrees in seattle. Cooling down to 23 in chicago. HEATING UP TO THE 20s ACROSS THE Eastern seaboard. Finally, in europe, scattered heavy rain for parts of the continent. A new system bringing heavy rain and risk of hail as well. Extremely hot across the southeast. 30 degrees in bucharest.

>>> We pay all the taxes we owe every single dollar. We don't stash money on some caribbean island. 
>> A defiant apple ceo on capitol hill defending his company's tax strategy as billions of dollars sit overseas. 
>>> It's a lie by admission. 
>> Mr. Hatch, I did not lie. 
>> You what? 
>> I did not lie, sir. 
>> A defiant irs executive also on capitol hill disputing allegations he kept the practice of targeting conservative groups a secret from congress. 
>> And our series on the future of health care kicks off tonight with a look how super computers are revolutionizing the way we treat cancer. All that and more tonight on "nightly business report "for TUESDAY, MAY 21st. 
>>> New milestones for the dow and s&p 500 today, they stand at new record highs. On wall street, stocks got a big boost after two top federal reserve street presidents say they don't expect the central bank to ease back on its massive bond buying program just yet. They said when the time is right the fed will adjust its buying of assets up or down as needed. Well, investors liked what they heard. The dow stocks added 52 points, and scoring another record by making gains for the 19th tuesday in a row. A lot of people keeping on that tuesday watch. The nasdaq edged up two points and the s&p added five points. 
[00:02:14]



>>> Politics and business met head on on capitol hill today. The issue, apple computers tax practices and whether the company uses gimmicks to avoid paying its fair share. In feisty senate testimony today, ceo tim cook defended apple's practice of storing profits in overseas subsidiaries. A senate report says apple's tactics helped it pay little or no tax anywhere on at least $74 billion in income over theast four years. Amon was there and joins us now from washington. Amon? 
>> Reporter: Hi, tyler. We expected fireworks today at this hearing today. What we didn't expect is we would get those fireworks before tim cook even began to testify. There was a dispute here between senator rand paul of kentucky and senator carl levin, the chairman of this committee. Senator paul didn't believe this hearing should be held in the first place. Take a listen. 
>> Frankly, I'm offended by the tone and tenor of this hearing. I'm offended by a $4 trillion bullying, berating, and badgering one of america's greatest success stories. If anyone should be on trial here, it should be congress. I frankly think the committee should apologize to apple. I think that the congress should be on trial here for creating a bizarre and byzantine tax code. 
>> You can apologize to anyone you want. This subcommittee is not going to apologize to apple. We did not drag them in front of this subcommittee. 
>> Carl levin not in the mood to apologize to apple and did not and instead drilled down on very specific and at times uncomfortable questions for the apple executives that were there, including tim cook. Take a listen to that. 
>> You point out, and accurately so, mr. Cook, that 95% of the creativity that goes into those products is in california. But two-thirds of the profits are in ireland, and you've made a decision, which you have a right to do, not to bring that money home. 
[00:04:26]



>> Senator, we're proud that all of our rnd, or the vast majority of it, is in the united states. 
>> I know, but the profits that result from it are sitting in ireland in corporations that you control that don't pay taxes. 
>> So, some tense moments there. Tense moments between these senators. Tyler, politically an interesting moment here was when SENATOR john McCain had to jump in and sort of leap to the defense of carl levin here, john McCAIN, A REPUBLICAN, FORMER Presidential candidate. Tyler? 
>> Aman, it's susie here. A lot of tough conversation back and forth. How do you think apple came out through all of this and tim cook in particular? Do you think apple's reputation was hurt by this hearing today? 
>> Reporter: I don't. I think there was less damage done here to apple than a lot of folks in washington expected, particularly given the tough revelations in that senate report that came out last night. The senate report said apple created three companies around the world that were not legal tax residents of any country anywhere in the world. That was the first time these senate investigators had seen anything like that. A lot of people were heaping praise on the company and holding up their iphones and how great they thought iphone was. 
>> Fascinating to watch. Thank you so much, reporting FROM WASHI??DPt 
>>> Coming up little later in the program, how many other big corporations are taking advantage of tax loopholes and what's the impact? We'll discuss it with david of the new york times. Tyler? 
>> Apple's tim cook wasn't the only ceo under fire today, the ceo of jpmorgan chase received backlash. They wanted to strip diamond of his chairman title, saying the bank of diamond himself needs more oversight following a $6 billion trading loss last year, but the effort failed and diamond gets to keep both titles. Kayla has more. 
>> Reporter: America's biggest bank is keeping its larger than life leader. Jamie dimon, chairman and ceo of jpmorgan chase since 2006 is holding on to both title, despite a proposal to split them. 32% of shareholders voted for it, that's far fewer than support of the same move last year, coming after the bank exposed a ging trading loss. 
[00:06:43]



>> Compared to last year, i thought it was an easier meeting. For a number of reasons, the $6 billion loss was huge. That's material and substance. Obviously, they already knew what the votes were on the question of separation and ceo, so I think probably relaxed everybody up there, because 40% last year and this year 32%. 
>> Reporter: There certainly have been other troubles at the house of dimon, currently, fewer than eight regulators investigating over trading and more. The company could ease concerns the board was doing too little to keep dimon and deputies in check, but two weeks ago, a new fear emerged, strip dimon of one title and he'll resign from both. 
>> We expected a higher vote this year and I think it became a referendum on chaining dimon and his leadership and it was never intended as a referendum on jamie dimon and his leadership. It was about putting an independent chairman in place. I think by making it about jamie dimon they reflected away from him. 
>> Reporter: Meaning the bank won the battle, but not the war. Overall at the board level could be near. Three members of the board's risk committee barely won approval. The lead director, formerly of exxonmobil, says issues there need to be addressed. Rising to highs not seen before the financial crisis as investors breathed easy dimon would stay. Still, similar battles rage on in boardrooms across the nation. 
>> This is an amazing event in terms of share holder rights. This is one step of many likely to happen over the next few years. 
>> Reporter: Kayla, "nightly business report," tampa, florida. 
>> Jpmorgan keeps shareholders at bay, at least for now, but no question investors are speaking more and more about how companies govern themselves and about how having a single person as chairman and ceo is a conflict of interest. 
[00:08:55]



>>> At least 200 dead and hundreds more injured from the devastating tornado that ripped through the town of moore, oklahoma. President obama promised the victims that the american people and the u.S. Government will be there for them. Jane wells saw the damage firsthand and has the latest developments and what some businesses are doing to help. Jane? 
>> Reporter: Thunderstorms and hail throughout much of the day made it very difficult to continue searching here, let alone begin recovery, but here late in the afternoon, officials said they believe they have accounted for at least all of the missing from a tornado that's now been upgraded to the most powerful category, an ef-5, and the economic toll will be catastrophic. 
>> It will be billions, billions of dollars, I believe, because of all the tremendous amount of structures and, certainly, the interruption of business in this area. It's going to take a long time to get all this cleaned up to rebuild the structures. We had five schools that were hit with this storm, and we lost several of the schools totally. The hospital was hit, huge movie theater was hit. Many different facilities and buildings, a bank was destroyed. 
>> Reporter: Now the rebuilding begins, national guardsmen, fema, and others will be joined by the private sector, volunteers with supplies from lowe's, a million dollars from home depot, who's letting first responders use the store as a command center, water from walmart, portable cell towers from verizon wireless and pledge from oklahoma's large energy companies, and oklahoma city thunder player kevin durant is contributing $1 million to the city he's adopted for "nightly business report," jane wells, moore, oklahoma. 
>>> And coming up a little later in the program, we're going to show you some new ways that companies are helping to keep cell phones charged during the oklahoma crisis and also in everyday life. 
>>> Still ahead, senators were on the attack and irs officials were firing back during the latest hearing. But do we know more now than we did before? 
[00:11:04]



>>> First, though, stocks have closed at 52-week highs today. 
>>> What did the former head of the irs know and when did he know it? Those are the key questions lawmakers asked today regarding the tax agency subjecting conservative political groups seeking tax exempt status to extra scrutiny. John harwood joins us from capitol hill with the latest. Over to you, john. 
>> Reporter: He said he didn't know much. That's the short version. We didn't learn much new from doug shulman or from steven miller, who replaced him as the acting irs commissioner until president obama fired him last week. Steve miller did acknowledge that he was the one who orchestrated that planted question at a bar conference that resulted in the disclosure of this in advance of the i.G. Report, and he took some flak from senators on the committee for not having corrected the record after earlier irs officials had said the targeting had not taken place. 
>> You didn't mention any of this in your responses to me, to the senate, or any other congressional body. Mr. Miller, that's a lie by omission. There's no question about that in my mind. It's a lie by omission. 
>> Mr. Hatch, I did not lie. 
>> You what? 
>> I did not lie, sir. 
>> You lied by omission. You knew it was going on, and you knew that we had asked. You should have told us. 
>> Now, we don't expect to get much news tomorrow either at the house oversight committee, but that doesn't mean it won't be a bad day for the white house, because we heard loisrnor plans to take the fifth amendment. That has the potential for lending an err of criminality to something the inspector general didn't find partisan, much less criminal. 
[00:13:21]



>> John, let me ask you a question about the fact that the white house council, one of the things we've learned since last week, was the white house council was aware of some of the contents of an inspector general's report for at least a couple of weeks before that information was made public. Is that likely to come up and continue to keep the coals burning underthis scandal? 
>> Reporter: You know, come up, but I don't think it's significant, tyler, because the i.G. Report had not come out. We're simply talking about a delay of a couple of days of discrepancy of a couple of days in when they were notified about something that was about to come out and the white house couldn't do anything until the i.G. Report came out anyway. It's not about the underlying conduct, why it happened, what motivated it. 
>> Tomorrow an irs presumably going to take the fifth amendment. Very interesting. John harwood, thanks very much. 
>>> We begin with a number of big retailers out with earnings. Home depot raised sales and profit outlooks. They credit the recovery in u.S. Housing for the boost. The results sent the stock to an all-time high, closing 2.5% higher in today's session, it sits at $78.71. 
>> Shares with sachs also rose after better than expected quarterly results. Sales at stores open at least a year were well above estimates. The company is in the middle of a multiyear, multimillion effort to close underperforming stores, upgrade computer systems, and improve online sales. The stock jumped to $13.67, then moved higher in after hours trading on an unconfirmed report of a possible sale. 
>>> Different story at best buy. The nation's biggest electronics retailer reported a loss last quarter. Excludeing that european sale, best buy posted a profit that did beat analysts forecast, but investors still dumped the stock on concerns of stick competition on companies like amazon. Best buy fell to $25.64. 
[00:15:28]



>>> Carnival shares also near the bottom of the s&p 500 today after a pair of analyst downgrades a day after the cruise ship operator cut its full year forecast. That follows a string of highly publicized incidents aboard ships, forcing the company to lower ticket prices to attract more passengers. Shares fell more than 4% today. They finished at $33.81. 
>>> As we mentioned earlier, apple ceo tim cook fielded a lot of heated questions today. And, in fact, the corporate tax code itself was a subject of great debate. Our next guest is here to shed light on what he says big loopholes at apple and tech companies in general, he's won pulitzer prizes for his coverage of apple. Welcome, good to have you with us. 
>> Thanks for having me. 
>> Mr. Cook today said, quote, apple pays all the taxes we owe, every single dollar. Have they? 
>> I think they have. I think the question here is not a question of legality, but a question of pushing the envelope, and that's when if you looked at the hearings, there's a lot of discussion about when is a company a shell company, when is it a real company, when is money that's held in u.S. Banks by apple affiltes considered offshore income, so you get into the big reason, the arcane bits of the tax code and it becomes a matter of, you know, how much should you pay and is it fair for a corporation that has gotten as much out of the u.S. As apple to pay as little as it does. 
>> David, what it comes down to is the $2 trillion that is held overseas by american companies that have made these profits in other countries and how do you get that money back here. That's the core of all this, so business leaders like tim cook are saying, you know, give us a lower tax rate. He was proposing single digits. Others have tax holidays, stuff like that. What can the u.S. Do to incentivize these companies to bring that money back? 
[00:17:34]



>> I think there's a question, a policy question, about should 
-- how much should they do t incentivize it. The companies can bring it back by paying the stated tax rate, and if you want to give them a break in 2004 they were allowed a 5% tax rate rather than 35%. The question then becomes does that give them an unfair competitive advantage with all the u.S. Companies that cannot afford to offshore their earnings. So, I think that is a question. In 2004, I think $300 billion was brought back at a reduced rate. There was a big promise it was going to lead to hiring and investment in the u.S. In fact, just the opposite happened. The companies that brought the most back, laid off workers and a study later showed 92 cents on the dollar was given back to shareholders, which is fine, but if the inducement of doing it is that it's some sort of stimulus, you know, the question why should taxpayers give a break to these shareholders. 
>> You're of the point of view it would seem from your first answer that apple did, in fact, pay what it owed, but took advantage of gaps in both irish and american tax law. If apple was living up to the letter of those laws and availing itself of the letter of the law, on the other hand, did it live up to the spirit of the law, in your view? 
>> I think that's the question, and what the report pointed out was that apple's, by having entities offshore, that technically in limbo. They are stateless companies that apple says do not owe taxes to any country, even though they are incorporated in ireland, they have part ownership in the british virgin islands. All the decision making is done in the u.S., But this is stateless. We don't owe any taxes. I think the common sense sniff test says is that right. The report said all the very highly sophisticated techniques that apple used might have saved company $10 billion a year in taxes in the u.S. And elsewhere. 
>> David, thank you very much, of the new york times. 
[00:19:36]



>>> Coming up in the program, there's a new front in the war on cancer, and a key player here is watson. This is the super computer of ibm, and he's doing things never done before to treat the disease. 
>>> But first, let's get a check on how commodities, treasuries, and currencies fared today. 
>>> Millions of us, smartphones have become a lifeline for phone calls, texts, e-mails to the web, but what happens when your phone battery runs low or out and you can't recharge it, like so many people in oklahoma today, they are unable to do that. Big coanies are working on ways to keep devices fully charged and working loer. John ford has more now from the annual ctia wireless convention in las vegas. 
>> This time it's going to go 
-- 
>> when disaster strikes, communication is a lifeline. People need their smartphones to keep connected to the outside world and stay on top of the latest developments. That's led today's relief organizations to try supplying more than just water and shelter. These days, disaster relief means taking care of your technology, too. This is the american red cross's new prototype. Inside, you can charge your gadgets by usb and you've got wifi. The red cross currently doesn't have the wireless power stations. The organization plans to have about two dozen in service by year end. 
>> It's important when your life has been turned upsidedown to have contact with the outside world, know there are people t there that are caring for you and wanting to help you. 
>> To be prepared, shoppers can find a few gadgets that can be extra useful during disasters, this one uses solar power to charge phones and tablets. Less than $150. When the sun isn't out, there are external batteries from companies like iwok and duracel that cost $100 or less, they charge a phone one or two times and hold a charge for several weeks. That's become especially important today when we rely on so many gadgets. 
[00:22:02]



>> Because batteries are so limited and the gap between the phone's performance and what the battery is able to provide is only increasing, then having infrastructure, think of it like atm machines, for example, or gas stations. 
>> And the goal, of course, is to stay connected, especially important during times like these. For "nightly biness report," I'm john ford. 
>>> During a crisis, battery power and overloaded cellular infrastructure can be issues. That is why all the major carriers recommend those in impacted areas of emergencies text rather than make phone calls. 
>>> And finally tonight, another story of technology helping out. This time big data could reap big benefits. A recent study says the use of realtime analytics could cut health care costs up to 15% annually. That works out as much as half a trillion dollars a year. And now there's a push by private businesses to help medical researchers collect data and treat patients, so we kick off a new series on the future of health care tonight with how IBM's WATSON COMPUTER IS HELPING Doctors at the forefront of battling cancer. Bertha kuhns reports. 
>> Not enough people are cured. People are hurt by our therapies, and we've got to find a better way. 
>> Reporter: Chief of oncology at the cancer center. 
>> There are some drug regiments that contain a targeted agent. 
>> Reporter: Oncologists have been working with ibm to turn watson, the cognitive computer famous for winning at jeopardy into a tool to help doctors provide the best cancer treatment options for patients. 
>> Getting potentially a chemotherapy. 
>> Reporter: To train watson, this last year the team ingested more than 2.5 million cancer data, written text from medical journals, clinical trial research, and 1,500 case files. 
[00:24:11]



>> Teaching the system how to read the medical records and medical reports, which is not a simple task. 
>> Reporter: Dr. Chris said watson's ability to learn was one thing that surprised him. 
>> And the second thing is just totally counterintuitive, that this machine is ultimately going to improve the care of each person. I mean, it's going to be the ultimate in personalized medicine. 
>> Also counterintuitive says ibm, watson's gotten smaller, using less server hardware or getting smarter. 
>> About this size, two racks. 
>> Reporter: Analysts say with the rising cost of cancer medications, there's a big push towards evidence-based medical care. Watson gives providers the evidence they need. 
>> It's humanly impossible for the doctors to pull all of the medical records, pathology reports, your family history, the most recent diseases and drugs that are, and bring it together to the point of treatment. That's where watson is a support system, we believe, will have breakthrough implications. 
>> Reporter: Until now, watson has been used with file cases. This summer, beta testing begins with patients in realtime. If the trial goes well, the commercial product should launch for cancer care providers by 2014. In new york, bertha kuhns for "nightly business report." 
>>> Tomorrow in part two of our series, we take a look how realtime data can be a game changer for improving patient care. 
>>> That's it for us tonight, "nightly business report," thanks so much for joining us. 
>> Thanks from me, as well. Have a great evening, everybody, and we hope to see you back here tomorrow night.

People in oklahoma are still picking through the rubble today trying to find what is left of the lives they knew before a two-mile wide tornado struck. The town of moore, oklahoma, has been leveled. Among those affected, hundreds of schoolchildren in school when the twister hit. Now they are trying to make sense of what happened to their world. 
>> They are heart wrenching scenes from the storm that ripped through moore, oklahoma. Children pulled from the rubble of two elementary schools that took a direct hit. 
[00:02:00]



>> The heroic teachers that lead their students to safety. 
>> There is the school. 
>> These were the first images to emerge at plaza towers elementary school. It has been blown apart by 200 miles per hour killer winds. Survivors held on to each other and wouldn't let go. 
>> It's like you see, completely destroyed. 
>> This is plaza elementary before it was destroyed. 440 students attended the top rated school. Many road out the tornado for an unimaginable 40 minutes. A mile away stood briarwood elementary. Thank goodness, every child came out alive. Desperate teachers tried to round up their students, shell shocked children wondered around. Teachers did their best to comfort them. 
>> I had to hold on to the wall to keep myself safe. I didn't want to fly away in the tornado. 
>> A light hit me on the head. 
>> Nerve wracked parents rushed to the school praying their sons and daughters would be found alive. Sitting with his teacher, little camden got the hug of his life when his mom finally found him.

>> On top of six children. 
>> Laying on top of them. 
>> They are all okay. 
>> All of mine are okay. 
>> Rhonda crosswhite appeared on "the today show." 
>> I was in a stall with some kids. I laid on top of them. One of my kids just kept saying I love you, please don't die with me. 
[00:04:01]



>> She was reunited with the student and his mom. 
>> I told you it would be okay. 
>> President obama praised the teachers heroism. 
>> Gratitude is with the teachers that gave their all to shield their children. 
>> We had to pull a car out of the front hallway off a teacher. She had three little kids underneath her. Good job, teach. 
>> These are the first photos to surface of children missing in the wreckage. Jenay hornsby is the daughter of an iraq war veteran. Officials say some of the youngest victims died doing exactly what they were told to do, taking shelter in the basement of the school. The children are said to have drown when the basement flooded. The grim search continues for bodies buried in the rubble. For these parents, teachers and students, life has never seemed so fragile. 
>> The news media is there to report on the disaster but some of the compelling images came from people who turned into reporters armed with their cell phones and video cameras. They are capturing the devastation firsthand. 
>> This is what it was like to witness hell. 
>> Listen to the roar. Oh, my god. 
>> This is not good. Please, dear god, keep these people safe. 
>> Extremely long mile wide tornado over oklahoma city. Pray for these people, folks. 
>> This is not what I wanted to see. 
>> The noise from the tornado was deafening. 
>> I have never heard a roar like that before. 
>> We need to go. We need to go. 
>> This dad was on his way to pick up his son at school. 
>> We are being shattered with debris. Large pieces of debris on the car now. 
[00:06:03]



>> Here is what it looked like as a family huddled in their storm shelter. It shattered the windshield of the storm chasers that captured the first tragic images of the devastation. 
>> Houses are leveled. 
>> Leveled, unrecoize nicable. 
>> Houses are 
-- unrecognizable. 
>> Houses are leveled. 
>> This doesn't look like it was a neighborhood. 
>> Oh, my god, guys. 
>> Here is what it was like to emerge from the shelter to discover everything before you is gone. 
>> The lord giveth and the lord taketh away. 
>> It will be months before oklahoma is able to rebuild in the wake of the deadly tornado. We have a firsthand look at the devastation the morning after the two mile wide twister came through. 
>> These are the grim scenes in moore, oklahoma today. Families picking through the rubble of what were once their homes. Volunteers removing an ocean of glass and debris. All over town cars are now just wrecks. Hundreds of houses now empty shells. Jim moret is there 
>> this strip mall took a direct hit. Some parts of the building are wiped out. There is another part that is fine then another part. Totally destroyed. 
>> In this restaurant devastation. Overhead the roof is gone. These unfortunate residents look like refugees from a war zone. Where children once played, now only wreckage and an eerie silence, silence that is until mother nature changes her mind. 
>> Some areas are fine. Next door it's gone. Then you hear that and it gives you the willies. 
>> Yeah. 
>> Volunteers are flooding into moore from all over. Everywhere they are confronted by these up pick scenes in the town blown away by nature's furry. 
[00:08:10]



>>> Incredibly the town of moore, oklahoma has been through this disaster before. In 1999 a tornado touched down in the same town killing 41 people, injuring hundreds of others. Out of the disaster there was an unforgettable image. A 10-month-old baby covered in mud, a child that came to be a symbol of the town's strength. We meet up with that young lady. 
>> The tornado that devastated moore, oklahoma is almost beyond belief. So is this, the fact that it happened here before, 14 years ago this very month. 
>> Through the night, twisters ripped through oklahoma and kansas. 
>> That's how we told the story OF THE MAY 3rd, 1999 TORNADO That killed 41 people and injured hundreds as it tore through the city of moore. In the midst of the destruction, this 10-month-old baby became a worldwide symbol of survival. She was called the mud baby. Alea was carried 100 feet from her home by the tornado. This deputy sheriff found the baby face down in the mud, filthy but unharmed. 
>> There is the man that found you. 
>> We were there for the joyous encounter between the deputy and alea's mom. 
>> I just wish this would never happen again. 
>> Time goes by. Here is alea again at age 14. What do you think of your town getting hit by a massive tornado twice? 
>> That lookso similar to what happened earlier. It almost took the same path and everything. That is really, really sad.

>> Was o.J. Simpson obsessed with his dead ex-wife nicole brown simpson. 
[00:17:44]



>> It was hard to deal with that everyday and, you know, comparing me, comparing me to nicole, nicole did this, nicole did that. You should do this. 
>> Christie prody tells "inside edition" that he talked about his murdered ex-wife each and everyday during their 12 year long relationship. I think he did snap. I think he was obsessed with nicole because he is still obsessed with her. The 12 years I was with him 
-- 
>> she said simpson tried to make her look more like nicole. When she first met simpson, she was a natural brunette. He encouraged her to dye her hair blond. 
>> He was try to fix my hair, part it to a certain side and comb it down and he would make comments like this is how nicole wore her hair. I got so sick of it. 
>> Christie ended up bearing a striking resemblance to simpson's ex-wife. It's like vertigo, the hitchcock film when he tries to make his new girlfriend look like his dead one. Christie was just 21 when she met 46- year-old simpson. 
>> I was young. He kept trying to shape me, mold me into what he wanted. 
>> She said simpson actually started threatening her and she came to fear that she may suffer the same fate as nicole. 
>> He would say things like you better watch out so something bad doesn't happen to you like nicole. 
>> We asked christie if she thought o.J. Murdered his ex-wife. She said after thinking about it for years she says probably more likely that he did than not. O.J.

>>> Tonight the worst might not be over. Right now, violent weather warnings stretching from the midwest all the way to the northeast and we have now received confirmation that the tornado that wiped out an oklahoma city suburb was a rare ef-5 twister. The monster twister mowed down moore, oklahoma, killing at least 24 people, including nine children. Many buried in the rubble of their flattened school. 
>> That's a big, big tornado. 
>> Oh, my god! 
>> In an instant, neighborhoods were destroyed. 
>> We were pulling walls off of people. There were people crawling out from anywhere and everywhere. 
>> Dozens of people lost their lives. 
>> The debris was so wide, it was 2 miles wide, 20 miles long. 
>> Many more were injured. And among the victims werg children. 
>> Honestly, I was like I'm not going to see tomorrow. I was just like, I don't want to die today, but you know, there's nothing else to do. 
>> Absolutely terrible. This tornado is massive. 
>> Heads up. Heads up, man. 
>> Oh, my goodness. 
>> Go that way. 
>> You guys need to get underground now. 
>> Everything is just gone. Like these are my friends' houses. 
>> I've never seen anything like this. 
>> I could hear it coming from a distance. They say it sounds like a freight train. 
>> In the midst of tragedy and loss of life, we've also seen the resilience and the courage and the strength of our people and we will get through this. We will overcome. We will rebuild. We will regain our strength. 
>> Hours of absolutely sheer panic. Parents rushing from one shelter to another frantically trying to find their children. The moore community center is one of the places where tornado victims will find missing relatives. Fox crescent is there live with the latest. 
[00:02:14]



>> We talked about the grade school. Is there any hope or are we beyond that? 
>> Greta, actually, there's better news in that there are revised numbers released from officials. Last night at this time we were talking about the possibility that there were 24 children, inside of that school that there were yet to be recovered. Officials revised that number saying there is a total of 24 people who died in that tornado, 9 of them children and the belief is that it was 7 inside that school. The number did change, as expected. However, it was adjusted down as opposed to what officials were saying last night where they told us to be prepared to have it adjusted up. All dealing with the chaos of a disaster. What happens when someone stays sat at one of the shellers. They have to register here and create a mark in the data system. So people can try to find their loved ones. There are six such shelters at the red cross set up throughout the oklahoma city area. The university of oklahoma has announced that it has opened up their dorms because they're on summer break for anyone to make use of those. Here's a problem, though. A lot of oklahomans who I have been talking to say it's a point of pride for them. They stay with friends and family. But because we've had so much troubleith the land lines here, with the cell phones here, with e-mails and texting, it's made it more difficult for people, even if they are with friends and family to get in touch with those looking for them. What some people have done, they've traveled from out of state to find people they can't reach. It's one of the challenges and the chaos that the people at the red cross are trying to settle a bit. We do know there are problems that have settled with regard to the security within that disaster zone area. The national guard, as well as other law enforcement members have been trying to keep people back as determined as people are to get back into that area because they want to simply curious, others want to see what they have lost. However, it's too dangerous and really rescuers need to continue to do their jobs. 98% is how sure the fire department's chief says he is that they have gotten everybody out and they have found all of the dead. He said what they've done is gone through three times all of the areas where they believe that there could be survivors or that there could be the dead. He said as soon as they've gone through each area three times, they will feel pretty sure that they have completed their search. So that's where things stand right now, greta. Before I let you go, I will tell you one other thing. It rained pretty hard today. We had a drastic storm come through this area. It added to the problem. The traffic is so thick, they're continuing to clean up the area. It makes it more of a mess. 
[00:05:02]



>> A lease I can't, thank you. 
>>> Rescue workers coming from all over, racing to find survivors and victims in the rubble of the neighborhoods that were literally plowed down by this tornado. Oklahoma governor mary fallon toured the devastation. She joins us. Good evening, governor. I can't imagine so many people in oklahoma don't have a place to sleep except the shelters. Do you have any sense of how many. 
>> We do have a sense of how many are in the shelters and we're fortunate that we have 131 people in the shelters. As you just heard from your reporter there, that a lot of the people have gone to stay with friends and relatives. So people in oklahoma have been very generous to take care of their relatives and certainly take care of their friends. 
>> Governor, one of the things we've seen with the tragedies, there's an incredible outpouring of help from everybody, the federal government, organizations, everything in the first few days. This is a huge catastrophe. You'll need help for quite a long time. What are you going to do to keep the momentum going? 
>> We are going to need help for a long time. Basically, what we're planning on doing is keeping people informed about what we need. There are a lot of people that have called to offer help. Heard all kinds of stories of people that just immediately came throughout the community walking to come up would the schools, the houses, the businesses to see if they could help people that might have been hurt in the tornado itself. And we certainly have had a lot of first responders who have come, not only from the various cities in the state and other states. I was at the plaza tower school earlier today and had a gentleman with a rescue dog from joplin. He had used his dog in the joplin tornado and oklahoma had sent people to joplin to help them when they had their disaster. Here he was coming back to oklahoma to hel us. We have had people come and certainly I've had so many people from governors that have called me, I've kind of lost track. Well over 30 governors have called me to offer assistance. The president has called several times. Several of the cabinet secretaries have offered their assistance. They realize this is a major disaster. And it is going to take a while to recover from this. We have a lot of work ahead of us. 
[00:07:24]



>> Governor, you know, you look at the pictures on the television, you think this is absolutely horrible. You hear about the tornadw and it's absolutely horrible. And then if you're one of these people who sees it, you saw it today. Tell me what you saw. It's so much worse in person. 
>> It is worse in person. I was down there until very late last night. Of course, the tornado struck after 3:00. I got down there about, I think it was around 7:00 by the time i got everything organized in the city and the emergency command center. Down there on the site. Then of course it became dark and I was in the dark because there is no electricity down there. Certainly there wasn't any water down there. There was a ton of debris and traffic as you mentioned is quite a problem. Cell service and phone lines were jammed up. Phone service was just out in many of the areas. Communication was hard to get information. Today I had the opportunity to go back and to fly with the national guard and other emergency personnel including the director, administrator of fema himself. Which we appreciate him coming personally. It was a sight to be seen to travel along the 17 miles of the path of the tornado and to see where it started and where it ded to fly over the schools, the neighborhoodsnd talking about blocks of houses that are gone. We're talking about miles, mile or two miles of houses that are gone. It's remarkable that we've had so few deaths. Any death is one too many. At this point in time, we know of 24. That's really quite remarkable. 
>> Especially when we thought it was 51 last night. That in a strange way is good news. Governor, thank you. And good luck. I know you have your work cut out for you. Thank you, governor. 
>> Thank you. We appreciate you. 
>>> Seven children killed when the tornado landed a direct hit on plaza towers elementary school. Tonight a scene of utter devastation where that school once stood. Griff jenkins is live in moore, oklahoma. 
[00:09:33]



>> Greta, I started today in dallas. I had to drive in and it was there at the airport in dallas that I met school superintendent jana barisi. We drove in together and had our cameras rolling when she saw for the first time the damage done at tower plaza, one much her man I schools. 
>> Kids were in here getting close to being out for the day. The storm just really mushroomed. They only had 16 minutes of warning. As you can see from this area, it's a residential area, or it was at least. Parents that could get here to pick up their kids did so. But the others 
-- you can't tell you about it's an older building. So they tried their best. They put the kids in their assigned spots. You can see the force and the fury of this storm is so very, very 
-- 
>> look at metal is wrapped around the poles. You can't tell that it used to be a school. It is like pretzels. It's the things of life that are almost macabre now the way that they're so twisted. It is beyond belief, sad. 
>> This has been dr. Barisi's home for more than 40 years. As you can see from that tape, it's overwhelming. The doctor talked a lot with me in the three-hour ride from dallas about the heroes here, the teachers, the local people that live here. We'll try and find more of them for you tomorrow, greta? 
>> Griff, thank you. 
>>> Tonight, while terrifying tornadoes are still threatening the midsection of the nation. Who is under threat. Meteorologist janice dean is in the fox extreme weather center tracking the storms. Janice, what's the latest tonight. 
[00:11:36]



>> We're still watching the potential for strong to severe weather in parts of the south and the gulf coast. Tornado watches and severe thunderstorm watches are being whittled away as this front moves through, which is good news. But we're still sort of in that line of fire across portions of texas, louisiana and arkansas, up towards memphis and nashville. No tornado warnings just yet. But we have severe thunderstorm warnings. With that we could see wind gusts in excess of 60 miles per hour, heavy rain and the hail. The very large hail. Moving into the carolinas, parts of georgia in towards charleston, west virginia. Thunderstorms there. And the northeast, we saw earlier tornado warnings in upstate new york. A lot of areas getting severe weather this evening. We'll continue to track it. Across the area that you see shaded in yellow, that's where we have our slight risk of severe weather through the evening hours. You can see the lines kind of scraping through. With that, we think damaging winds certainly will be an issue. Even up towards upstate new york and parts of new england we're going to look for the threat of severe storms. Just keep that in mind and keep your noaa weather radios on and keep alert to the weather bulletins. Looking at the satellite forecast for you as we move further out in time. East texas watching you. Louisiana up towards the mississippi river and the tennessee river valley, greta, the good news is it's going to be your garden variety thunderstorms as we get into wednesday and clearing pattern as we move into moore, oklahoma, which is certainly great news. It will be cool tonight, temperatures will warm up. A slight chance of storms later this week. But nothing severe on the horizon. Although, greta, make mention that may is typically the busiest month for tornadoes. So they're not out of the woods by any stretch of the imagination across tornado alley. 
>> Janice, the one that hit moore, oklahoma, was on the ground for a very long time. Two technical questions. What keeps a tornado down so long, number one? And number two, what makes it begin to slow down and vanish? 
[00:13:41]



>> Those are very good questions. And one that still scientists are not really sure of. There's a couple of things that a tornado of this magnitude needs. It needs the moisture feed, it needs that warm air from the gulf of mexico, so that unstable air mass and it also needs the vortex in the upper level of the atmosphere to keep the storms rotating. Because it scraped the ground for 40 minutes, which is a very long time in tornado standards to see a storm of thinitude on the ground. It needs that dynamic and it was a textbook atmosphere if you will, when you look at all the ingredients being put together. The atmosphere was ripe. Sometimes we call it like a pressure cooker. You know, you've got a pot on the stove and it bubbles up, you've got the cap on your pot and when you release the cap, you know, the steam comes out and that's kind of what happened in the atmosphere. The cap kind of popped off and the energy just went through the roof. So when we look at the dynamics of the atmosphere, they were ripe. Something that we really haven't seen all season. And that's why we saw these violent thunderstorms. Now, the dissipation of the storms, we'll look at the potential of the moisture feed as well as if thevorticity is in place. Everything that we look at in terms of where and when we'll see the damaging potentially dangerous storms, it was all 
-- the ingredients were all together. But in terms of what made this last and what made it dissipate is still, as far as meteorologists go, still a bit of a mystery. One that we will continue to observe and learn from. 
>> Janice, thank you as always. 
>> Okay, greta. 
>>> Now to the frantic and meticulous search for survivors. There have to be more survivors, right? 
[00:15:42]



>> Rescue crews going through an elementary school brick by brick and many buildings two and three times making sure they find anyone who is still trapped. Captain derek stuart of the oklahoma city fire department joins us. Good evening, sir. Am I right that you still might find survivors? It's still not too late? 
>> Caller: Good evening. Yes, we're going to continue searching throughout the evening. Not going to give up on anyone. Going to continue searching until we get all through the debris. And get everything removed so we can get a good look at all the structures. 
>> You started yesterday on this, after the tornado hit. What was your 
-- tell me how you did this. 
>> Caller: The local responders got there first and then we actually responded with oklahoma task force one which is our state asset. We responded on scene and assisted with oklahoma city fire, moore, all the other agencies that were providing mutual aid. We wound up going down range into the debris field, going house by house. Going through all the rubble. Just searching every structure on by one. 
>> And when I've been to most of the hurricanes and stuff, they make a notation on the house to indicate it's been searched. Did you mark the different buildings? 
>> Caller: Yes, ma'am. We made search markings. Marking time of entry, exit. Marking all hazards. Putting our identification marks if we had victims and moving, like I said, from one structure to the next. 
>> Captain stewart, thank you, sir. Thank you to all the people you're working with. Please let them know we're all grateful for their hard work.

>>> What do you think about this? Top irs official is pleading the fifth. Lois lerner, the head of the exempt organization's division will not answer questions on the irs scandal tomorrow. Darrellsiah is here to talk about that. The man who ran the irs agency. Grilling former commissioner douglas shulman. 
>>> The american people deserve to know the truth about what went on here. They deserve to know why the truth was kept from them for so long. 
>> How did this happen? 
>> Mr. Chairman, I can't say. I can't say that I know that answer. 
>> You're the commissioner. 
>> I'm six months out 
-- 
>> you got some sense of the outfit. You were the commissioner for six years. 
>> I don't think I can answer that question. 
>> I'm disappointed. You've had time to think about this. You certainly have more thought than that. 
>> What I knew was there was a list. I did know that tea party was on it. I didn't know what else was on the list. I had a partial set of facts. And I knew that the inspector general was going to be looking into it. I knew that it was being stopped. 
>> These hearings are not a sideshow designed to distract from the president's agenda. I hope that the president and his administration are not attempting toistract us from getting to the bottom of this. 
>> I was dismayed and I was saddened to read the inspector general's conclusions that action had been taken creating the appearance that the service was not acting as it should have. 
>> How could an agency with the power that the internal revenue service has engage in this kind of conduct and it not be politically motivated? 
>> I certainly am not personally responsible for creating a list that had inappropriate criteria on it. 
[00:23:53]



>> Finance committee member senator johnny isaac son joins us. 
>> Greta, good to be with you. 
>> Mr. Shulman, the former commissioner of the irs, when did he say he learned about the targeting first? 
>> He said he first learned about it recently when he read the ig's report. 
>> He knew nothing beforehand? 
>> That's what he said. I don't know was the operative language. Every question that was answered was said I don't know. 
>> At some point, we just played the package, he knew there was a list with tea party on it. Was that before a few weeks ago? 
>> He a referred to it as if it was. Ms. Lern was over 
-- recognized the problem in cincinnati. She may or may not have told them. That's what we got to find out. 
>> Did you think today that mr. Shulman was candid, complete or did you think he misled the senate today? 
>> I'm not an attorney but I've been in enough depositions to watch somebody coached by an attorney. I think he was advised by an attorney not to make any statements and he didn't. 
>> Did you learn anything new today? 
>> Only that there still is a culture in the irs on this issue of mystery, of not disclosing everything that went on. There has to be a who and a when and a what. We've got to find out those answers. It just didn't happen in cincinnati with a handful of operatives. 
>> So what's your next step? It seems to me that a good step would be to zero in on what's going on in cincinnati since that's at least one of 
-- sort of where it started. 
>> Ms. Lerner tomorrow is going to take the fifth amendment tomorrow. She's not going to say anything that could incriminate her. We need to focus the investigation on cincinnati and go from the ground up. Senator back us has done a good job and senator hatchet. We must get to the bottom of it. It's shaking the confidence of the american people in the internal revenue service, which is the wrong thing to have happen. 
>> A lot of senators said to him, you just sat on that guilty knowledge. That's a lie by omission. Apparently he thought that he was well aware of it long before a few weeks ago. 
[00:25:56]



>> I think he was right. 
>> Do you think the white house had any information on this before mid-april? 
>> I don't know. But I trusted mr. Pfeiffer on the tv shows on sunday morning that he was incensed. He thought we ought to get to the bottom of it. The white house needs to let us get to the bottom of it. This is important for our country and the american people. Quite frankly, important for the white house. 
>> It's odd what mr. Pfeiffer said. What he said is that he didn't have much information yet you had jay carney saying on monday that as of the middle of april, the white house counsel and senior advisers and today jay carney saying that there's a meeting among some people, the irs and the treasury how to explain it to the american people. Dan pfeiffer may not have known much on sunday, but there's more information to be known. 
>> It's quite obvious when they planted a question at a press conference, they were struggling with how the american people would learn about a very bad situation in the irs. 
>> What do you think about planting that question? 
>> As miller today apologized for it, admitted it was wrong, it was the wrong thing to do, if they found out they had been accused of wrongdoing by the inspector general in an audit, they ought to come forward and disclose it to the american people. Not play games by planting a question at a press conference. 
>> I thought that was suspicious. Anyway.

>> Nice to see you. 
>> Thanks for covering this. Obviously american people want answers. 
>> You won't get them tomorrow because we understand she will be taking the fifth amendment when she appears before your committee. 
>> She's an important witness. We still hold out hope that she will change her mind. Often, as you know, people don't always listen to their attorneys and in this case, she's critical to the conduit between comssioners and other individuals and the actual places where so much was known. 
>> You know, I actually, if i were her lawyer, I'd advise her to take the fifth too. There is the justice department opened a criminal investigation and she does 
-- I mean, there is a risk she says something tomorrow. 
>> We could say there's a risk for everybody. The american people had confidence in the irs. The irs had a responsibility. The two commissioners, I guess they're both immediate past commissioners somewhat now have said they didn't know it. 
>> Who 
-- from what I understand in summer of 2011, she was aware of it. And she was the head person in this division. And it was still going on in january of 2012. Why wouldn't anybody stop this? 
>> Well, that's probably the best question for the american people. Like so many things that are wrongdoing, it can be a local event in the wrongdoing, overzealous irs individuals, people who start down a path of one, then ten, then 100 of these, if you will, tea party groups. But at some point people saw it, they became aware of it and it continued. I think one of the important things is it didn't just continue 2011. It continued 2012, it continued through the election. It continues today. As far as we can tell, there are organizations that have been out there for three years and have neither been accepted nor rejected simply tortured in a way in which they can't even appeal a rejection because they haven't had one. 
[00:34:06]



>> Why did this happen? 
>> That's a great question that I'm not sure we're going to get any time soon. What we know is that in the i.G. Report and in my conversation with the i.G., They don't have internal controls that would prevent this from happening in the future. 
>> It wasn't just one person. That's the thing. It's not just one person being a jerk to one taxpayer. I mean, this was a targeted list. A group of people. And it almost seems like, you know, at best this was the culture. That it was okay to go after these people for whatever reason, didn't like their ideas or whatever. It's just there's something, it's more than just one person. 
>> Greta, we've become a polarized country. It is certainly possible that people at the irs viewed that they were doing something goodbye going after people who filled out forms saying that they believed in smaller government, in constitutional fundamentals. But, of course, if they did that, it's not only wrong but it's dangerous. The irs has to be one of those organizations that's constantly second-guessing its own decisions, not just the decisions of taxpayers. 
>> They certainly didn't did that here. 
>> No, they didn't. 
>>> Congressman, thank you. I guess there will be a short hearing tomorrow? 
>> No, we'll go the full length. We'll be perhaps one witness shy. But we have plenty of questions, we did a full deposition today under oath. We got a lot of information. The information today will lead to questions tomorrow. 
>> Good. We'll be watching. Thank you, sir. 
>> Thank you. 
>>> Now to breaking news in the justice department. Phone records scandal. It's our favorite here at fox news. We know the doj's secret seizure of fox news phone records goes way beyond one reporter's information. Correspondent shannon breem is here with the latest. Now we pass notes by the way. We don't call each other. Shannon, what is going on? 
>> It's interesting. We may have to turn to smoke signals at some point. New information is coming out about this case involving james rosen. Because the legal filing made by the u.S. Attorney's office what we found they weren't going after records for him personally. It appears because we have the area code and the exchanges, they match several important fox offices and different outlets. Our lines that feed into work space at the pentagon, the state department, the white house and also several reporters and producers' cell phones as well. 
[00:36:24]



>> This is so appalling to me. Are there any other news organizations other than the ap p. And their problem on another issue, any other news organizations targeted in this investigation? 
>> Not so far. This focused on james rosen and spread out to a broad audience at fox. It's interesting to see how other media are reacting. They're taking heat from others who realize it could be them. 
>> If you go through the affidavit, he's so outrageous, the fbi actually accuses james rosen of being a co-conspirator on very serious crimes in the affidavit. I've never seen that. I've never known 
-- haven't seen anything like that in any of the affidavits ever that I've looked at. 
>> It's something that a lot of journalists have discussed in the history of the relationship that the government has. There's been a tacit understanding that they may go after the leaker or the government source but never the journalist. For here to have a suggestion that james rosen allegedly engaged in criminal activity by talking with a source, that seems to be new to some people. 
>> They're focusing on the journalism aspect. I'm a lawyer, you're a lawyer. I'm appalled that a judge didn't see what was going on. The point of having a judge review a search warrant and sign off or not, is so it can be the independent person's, not a team trying to get somebody. 
>> You also know there's a lot of weight when an fbi agent signs an affidavit, puts his name to the allegations, that carries a lot of weight with any judge. 
>> I think it's worth noting. I blogged back in november of this year of 
-- of last year that I thought that the obama administration is trying to punish fox news because we were so aggressive of benghazi, trying to get the facts, which incidentally, there's a lot more we're learning. T the state department held a meeting and didn't include fox news. Then the cia held a meeting with all the media, didn't include fox news. There's been a little pattern of excluding fox news because we've been very aggressive on these stories. 
[00:38:26]



>> We've reached out to the justice department and white house on the newest revelations on the monitoring of the phone lines. We have not heard back from the justice department, but jay carney told our ed henry, that he can't quote on an ongoing investigation.

-- we mentor high school and college students and conservative political philosophy. 
>> Tell me, you applied for a tax exempt status. And you didn't like some of the questions you were asked? 
>> Yes. We applied for tax exempt status in january of 2011. The first substantive response came in may of 2011. And although that letter was not as invasive and vague than the later letter, I knew something was ass. I gave the answers I could. They gave me about tw weeks to reply. Couldn't get ahold of an irs agent. Then it was about six months of constantly trying to reach the agent on the telephone until december of 2011 when I finally reached an agent, first thing she told me was my file had been moved to another desk. Someone else was handling my file. And then I asked this question of that agent. I said, why in the world is my application taking so long? And he said these words. He said we've been waiting on guidance from our superiors as to your organization and other similar organizations. It was pretty clear that wasn't coming from down the hall. He didn't say where, but it wasn't from cincinnati. 
[00:45:54]



>> What were the questions asked that made you suspicious? 
>> Well, I mean, there was a ton. I got a 31-point letter and each question had sububtegories. If I do focus on three. What the political affiliation of the people who mentored me. I didn't know the answer to that question in full. I couldn't 
-- it would tack a long time for me to complete an application. The next question they asked me was, what are my views on every issue. Every issue. I don't know how to answer that question without perjuring myself. The most disturbing question i got, asked me to identify those I was teaching and to provide details of what I was teaching them. 
>> All right. I imagine, do you have any phone conversation with them and say the questions were out of line or was this all done in wrting? 
>> Well, I only had one phone conversation. I had repeated attempts to reach an agent, voice mail, voice mail, please call me. Only that one conversation with the agent in cincinnati who told me it was his superiors who directed him to do this. 
>> Are you going to sue and what's your cause of action? 
>> Yes. We're represented by the aclj and many other organizations and we expect tole a complaint this week. I've not read the complaint because they're still making adjustments to it. We're seeking a declaratory action. I want to get my status. 28 months and counting it's been. The rest of that with will come out and jay is better able to speak to that issue. 
>> This is really outrageous, isn't in? Not just your group. Night after night, people want their tax exempt status to do their groups and the irs has stood in the way. 
>> Yeah. I don't know why. We've seen it in the news. Barack obama's half brother, he got status in a month. I believe it went retroactive. Here I am 28 months and counting and I still don't have it. 
>> I don't know anything about that. I've got e-mails from viewers. I keep meaning to check on that one. I can't corroborate or deny. Anyway, kevin, thank you. Good luck.

To this day I can hardly believe I was capable of such violence but I know that i was. And for that I'm golg to be sorry for the rest of my life. I made many public statements I would prefer the death penalty to life in prison. Each time I said that, I meant it, I lacked perspective. Until recently coy not have image yained 
-- imagined stand brg you all and asking you to give me life. So-to-me, life in prison was the most unapeep peeling outcome I could think of. I thought I'd rather die. I didn't know if I got life there are many things I can do to affect positive change. And contribute in meaningful ways. A few months before trial and jury selection my hair was past my waist. Ski donated it to locks of love the nonprofit creating wigs for cancer patients who have lost their hair that. Was my third donation since being arrested. If I'm allowed to live in prison I will continue to donate to that organization for the rest of my life. Boy like to start a book club or reading group something that brings people nogt a positive way to share and recommend other good books and stimulate discussions of a higher nature.

>> To get young girls interested in the stem fields, that was her life's mission. You talk to aof astronauts, their mission was s to go to space. Her mission was a springboard for something else. 
>> Ifill: That's all ahead on tonight's newshour. 
>> Major funding for the pbs newshour has been provided by: ?????? ?????? ?????? moving our economy for 160 years. Bnsf, the engine that connects us. 
[00:02:19]



>> And with the ongoing support of these institutions and foundations. And... 
>> This program was made possible by the corporation for public broadcasting. And by contributions to your pbs station from viewers like you. Thank you. 
>> Ifill: The people of moore, oklahoma, began the long climb back today from catastrophe. Authorities labored to clear wreckage in the shattered suburb outside oklahoma city, and the death toll stood at 24, including nine children. Officials said the numbers could rise higher yet in the wake of a tornado that was one of the most powerful ever. The scene that met jason leger as he emerged from his cellar on monday evening unscathed was one of total destruction. 
>> The lord giveth and the lord taketh away. 
>> Ifill: Today, similar scenes greeted those who had fled and returned to survey what, if anything, was left of their homes. 
>> It's going to take time to rebuild, the families. You look at you see the movies and everything, but when you are actually standing there, yeah... 
>> It's hard. It's hard, but, you know, I know that the lord is going to provide. He's provided before. He has shown his power to us before. 
>> Ifill: In the immediate aftermath, dozens of people were rescued from the rubble of homes that collapsed around them. The grueling search for more survivors went on through the night. National guard troops joined in, going house-to-house, shining flashlights into the wreckage. 
>> Each of our guys will have multiband communication radios. We can talk to aircraft, we can talk to personnel on the ground. Thermal images allow us to see cold, warm bodies, people in the dark. Night vision equipment, we can see in the dark, low-light instances. 
>> Ifill: Fire and police crews from around the region jack- hammered their way through the debris. Bucket by bucket, they pried it away, looking for any sign of life underneath. The twister, estimated at up to two miles wide, laid waste to a 20-mile stretch in 40 minutes. In that time, it reached ef-5 status, the most powerful, with winds of at least 200 miles an hour. Many told harrowing stories of survival. 
[00:04:48]



>> It was coming straight towards us because it's heading east right up the middle of the road. So, at that point, it's time for us to just start making moves. So, we go a little bit farther down the road-- I'd say about 100 meters-- and as it's coming up from behind us, I say, "katie, get in the storm ditch." We go in the very middle of the tunnel itselfs the tornado passes over the highway. 
>> Ifill: Among the survivors, school children who were just about to be dismissed for the day when the tornado hit a little before 3:00 p.M. 
>> I was on the ground, and i just... My ears just went "whooo," and I couldn't hear anything except cracking and kids screaming. 
>> The tornado went in, and, i was so afraid that I was hanging onto one of the desks. And I fell back, and then all the dirt start getting on my eyes and on my clothes. 
>> Ifill: Briarwood elementary was all but destroyed. Miraculously, everyone survived. But at nearby plaza towers elementary, seven children lost their lives. The superintendent of moore public schools, susan pierce, said today they followed disaster drills to the letter. 
>> Yesterday, our administrator staff, teachers and students put our crisis plan into action immediately. We monitored the weather throughout the day, and when it was time to shelter, we did just that. A tornado's path is highly unpredictable, but, with very little notice, we implemented our tornado shelter procedures at every school site. 
>> Ifill: In addition to the schools, a local hospital was ravaged and countless homes were flattened. Oklahoma governor mary fallin viewed the destruction from the air today. 
>> It is very wide. It is hard to look at because there is so much debris on the ground itself. In many places, homes were absolutely destroyed, taken away. There's just sticks and bricks, basically. It's hard to tell if there was a structure there or not. If you get into some of the major neighborhoods, you can't tell where the streets were. The street signs are gone. 
[00:06:59]



>> Ifill: And in washington, president obama promised the federal government would do everything it could to get the town back on its feet. 
>> The people of moore should know that their country will remain on the ground, there for them, beside them, as long as it takes. For there are homes and schools to rebuild, businesses and hospitals to reopen. 
>> Ifill: In the meantime, a caravan of semi-trucks loaded with bulldozers and diggers arrived in moore today to do the heavy lifting. Search dogs were also on hand as teams planned to keep looking for anyone who might yet be found in the ruins. 
>> Brown: Jay newton-small is in moore for "time" magazine. I spoke with her a short time ago. Jay newton-small, thanks so much for joining us. Can you tell us, do you have a sense of where they are in terms of the search for survivors at this point? 
>> Sure. I spoke with the local mayor here in moore and he said that they're actually not expecting to find any more bodies, at least he hopes so. They're not going to completely rule it out but they do believe gen they've done two sweeps and by nighttime they've done three sweeps with sniffer dogs that they don't think they will find any more people, at least no more people alive and this will be a recovery operation from here on in. And that's a good thing in the sense that, you know, hopefully they'll get a real sense of the numbers of missing people and they can rule out any more deaths. 
>> Brown: You've been watching some of these sweeps, I gather. Is it literally door to door or wreckage to wreckage? How are they doing it? 
>> It is literally door to door and wreckage to wreckage and you CAN SEE THE Xs MARKED ON THE Different cars and buildings and they do them in color code so one pass means a black x, another two passes means a red x so that way they know the place has been searched and they've looked in every possible corner and there isn't anyone inside and the teams can move on. 
>> Brown: You've been with these responder teams. Give us a sense of what you've seen. What does it feel like and look like? 
[00:09:02]



>> You know, with tornados the most amazing thing is the hit or miss nature of it. So you'll have blocks where one whole side of the block the houses are completely fine and the other side they're decimated. And this is h has been an unusually powerful tornado in that it's not just that they're pancaked, it's like licked clean. The only thing you see on the plot is the shadow of where the house once was and a bunch of brown grass that was once there and it's the only thing that delineates that the house was there and there's debris everywhere else. It's really just 
-- the power of this storm is stunning in this case and you see that with search-and-rescue teams. They are really looking under every plank of wood just in case somebody is hiding behind it. You hear stories about a student in the school who was found underneath a chalk board that was laying down. So it's really, like, every nook and cranny, that's what they're searching. 
>> Brown: And what are the people there telling you about their own 
-- either their experiences of it comes or their own survival stories? 
>> I mean, that's also been amazing. I spoke to one young man who saw it coming, ran into a 7-eleven to warn people to take shelter, he left, drove off, was racing away from the tornado, all four people in that 7-eleven died. He took shelter under a bridge, he managed to survive. They talk about the roaring of the air, how incredibly powerful it sounds and you think nothing will be left when you come out and surprise, surprise, either your house is still there or, in fact, there is there really is nothing left. And they do talk about just the debris that you see and the force of which have the debris is embedded into cars and into stone walls, into concrete. It really just flings cars and smashes them like little toys, it's just stunning the power of nature that you see. I think a lot of people you see walking around are kind of dazed because they're shocked by it. 
>> Brown: That's what I was wondering. Is anybody able to think about what now, what next, what do they do? 
>> I mean, a lot of people this afternoon I saw for the first time really starting to clean up take out brooms and start to sweep and it's such a little thing to be able to clear your driveway but it's important to people and, you know, when your house is erect but your driveway is clean somehow it's really 
-- I spoke to one woman speaking her driveway of this house that had been totally ruined and she was like "at least I know i won't gate flat tire with my car and it's the beginning, it's the first step." So that's what people are looking to do is the first step they'll take to rebuilding this town. 
[00:11:31]



>> Brown: Let me ask you very briefly, jay. Does it look as though they have enough resources there in terms of the relief effort? 
>> The relief effort has actually been really impressive and, you know, the 
-- every official that I spoke to from the governor to the mayor has said that fema has been really amazing in this case and has provided whatever is needed and cut through red tape and you see that with the search teams out there. There's a combination of homeland security, fema, as well as local police and state police and you see that also in terms of there's water everywhere, there's vans going around supplying first 
-- you know, first responders as well as locals with food, with water, any kind of shelter that's needed they've been supplying. So it really has been a very good response so far and that seems to be the unified response. 
>> Brown: Jay newton-small of "time" magazine, thanks so much. 
>> Thank you. Sergeant lewis, thanks so much for joining us. We heard you're doing two and three sweeps of the area. Is there still some hope of finding people or do you have a sense that most are accounted for at ts point? 
>> Well, we've actually done one complete sweep. We're in the process of our second sweep. We actually are also still working on plaza towers elementary school. We have large equipment there now that we're trying to move some of the larger debris out of the way. There's still 20 to 30-foot pile high at the elementary school that they've got to the go through and to go from one end of the city to the other it takes pretty much an entire day. So we're about halfway through the second sweep. There is a possibility that we could find someone possibly still a storm cellar or safe room that's just been covered up. Last night most of the search was done in the dark. Now with the light and we also have a lot more heavy equipment we're more equipped at doing the search correctly. 
[00:13:33]



>> Brown: Tell us a little bit more about what else is happening in the community today in particular shelters, food, and aid. Somehow that going for people? 
>> We are 
-- just in the past we've had enormous support here in the city of moore and it's showing again. You know, there's literally cases and cases of water being brought to the volunteers. I know at the different places we have for shelter we have numerous things being dropped off for the victims of this storm but it's just an outpouring of support in all different ways: Volunteer, money bringing things. Just everything. We're pretty much overwhelming the with support that we have. 
>> Brown: Tell me, this is your community, what did you see today as you went around? 
>> Well, it's pretty hard to believe. This is 
-- I've grown up here my entire life, worked here for 13 years, went to high school here. To see the center of the city pretty much from border to border almost wiped clean is 
-- I don't know that it's still set in for a lot of officers from the moore area. We've been so busy running here and there just trying to do our job, I think it will take a couple days to set in. But it's 
-- when you really stop is whenever it kind of gets to you and it's extremely upsetting to see what people are going through. It's devastating. 
>> Brown: Officials earlier today had said that the death toll 
-- the death toll still could rise. Is that still the thinking at this point? 
>> There's a possibility just for the fact 
-- the size of this disaster is so enormous. The amount of debris that has piled up, it's really hard to be 100% until you have the search-and-rescue dogs search nearly 
-- you know, from one side of the city to the other. We have so many places that people could still be. It's hard to say 100% that we've found everybody. 
[00:15:37]



>> Brown: Sergeant jeremy lewis of the moore police department. Our condolences to your community. Good luck to you and thanks so much for talking to us. 
>> Thank you. 
>> Brown: Joining us live in boulder, colorado, bob henson, a meteorologist for the national center for atmospheric research. Even as the rescue continues, what can you tell us about the size and force of this tornado and what caused it to be so powerful? 
>> Well, it was an extremely powerful tornado, now rated at ef-5 on the enhanced fujita scale. That places hit in the top one tenth of one percent of all tornados. The u.S. Usually gets about 1,200 or so tornados in a particular year and there's usually only about one on average this reach this is strength. In terms of what caused it to be so strong, there are a few days each year that have the general conditions that lead to strong tornado. Warm moist unstable air near the surface, colder air aloft, also wind shear, which is when the winds are blowing one direction below and a different direction aloft and that imparts the air with a spin that can get sucked up into a thunderstorm. And then finally that rotation is concentrated in the tornado and there's some mystery about what makes that happen. So the conditions are there on a number of days and it's still a little bit difficult to say, for example, the day ahead of time which days will produce an ef-5. It was apparent within a couple of hours that the potential far bad tornado was developing quickly. 
>> Brown: Well, I want to pursue that a little bit more. How well was this tracked ahead of time and what can you tell today about how much warning and wind people got 
-- when people got the warning. 
>> Well, the tornado was very well forecast. Within about an hour it was clear severe thunderstorms were developing. About tensor minutes before the tornado touched down there was a tornado warning issued with the expectation it was going to touchdown. It then moved into moore about ten minutes after touchdown. So people of moore had anywhere from maybe ten or 15 to 20 minutes of the tornado's arrival. It was also 
-- seemed a few days out there was a potential for severe weather. A product called convective outlooks are issued by the noaa storm prediction center and those are outlined in a broad brush way which parts of the country could see severe weather. So you could see several days out the potential and then in the immediate couple hours you could see the conditions lining up for specifically in the moore/oklahoma city area. The tricky part is maybe six to 24 hours out and my lab in part is part of a project right now which is specifically trying to prove predictions in that six to 24-hour window. 
[00:18:17]



>> Brown: What about the weather situation today in oklahoma and elsewhere becae there were fears of continued 
-- of more tornados. 
>> Well, this is a good example of that because as recently as yesterday it looked like there was a chance for more significant tornado action today. It now-- at least the last i looked-- was loo more like kind of garden variety thunderstorms, maybe some severe thunderstorms but probably not the kind of tornados like we saw yesterday. So the more we can improve calling those characters of thunderstorms a day or so out, that will be fantastic. But certainly in terms of the warnings that are issued an hour before and the warning system, it worked flawlessly, I would say, in the moore area. The word got to people. There's still work to be done, we can have people interpret warnings and having a place to go. I mean, many places in oklahoma don't have basements partially because of the soil type and so people don't necessarily have a place to take shelter even if they know a violent tornado is on the way. 
>> Brown: Bob henley, thank you so much. 
>> You're welcome. 
>> Ifill: Online, you can watch our report from 1999, when another tornado devastated the town of moore. Still to come on the newshour: Who knew what and when at the i.R.S. And the white house; the department of justice tracks reporters to prosecute leaks; apple defends offshore tax havens; and promoting women in the sciences. But first, with the other news of the day. Here's hari sreenivasan. 
>> Sreenivasan: A federal appeals court today refused to order the release of photos and video of osama bin laden from the u.S. Raid that killed him in 2011. The obama administration argued the images could reveal intelligence methods and trigger violence against americans. Today, a three-judge panel in washington agreed. It rejected a bid by the conservative watchdog group judicial defense to make the pictures public. In syria, the battle raged for a third day in a key town near the border with lebanon. Government forces and hezbollah fighters from lebanon have been FIGHTIjG TO RETAKE QUSAIR, WHICH Rebels have controlled for more than a year. Rebel video today captured the aftermath of a government air strike on qusair. It showed heavily damaged buildings and rubble in the streets, as well as the interior of a mosque hit in the attack. The guardian council of iran today barred a former president popular with reformers from running again in next month's election. Akbar hashemi rafsanjani is now 78 years old. He has criticized the government for crushing protests against the disputed presidential election in 2009. Also barred from running today, a top aide to outgoing president mahmoud ahmadinejad, who's repeatedly clashed with the ruling islamic clerics. Guatemala's highest court has overturned the genocide conviction of former dictator efrain rios montt. The former general was convicted this month in the killings of more than 1,700 ethnic mayans, DURING THE EARLY 1980s, BUT LAST Night the high court declared the trial should have been stopped earlier to resolve defense appeals. Rios montt's attorney hailed the ruling. 
[00:21:27]



>> 
( translated ): THE RIGHT OF Defense was violated constantly, which is sacred. It is the a constitutional rule. No other superior rule exists. It is an institution of law and it has to be complied with. Montt. 
>> Sreenivasan: The court ordered the trial to return to where it was in mid-april. For now, rios montt remains in a military hospital. He is 86 years old. The head of j.P. Morgan chase, jamie dimon, survived a bid today to strip him of one of his jobs. Shareholders at the bank's annual meeting voted to keep dimon as both chairman and c.E.O. He had been criticized after the bank suffered a $6 billion loss last year on complex debt securities. On wall street, the dow jones industrial average gained 52 points to close at 15,387. The nasdaq rose five points to close at 3,502. Those are some of the day's major stories. Now, back to jeff. 
>> Brown: The drama surrounding the internal revenue service shifted to a new scene today. The senate finance committee heard from the man who ran the agency until last fall, and his successor. Judy woodruff has our report. 
>> Do you swear the testimony you're about to give is the truth? 
>> Woodruff: The hearing marked the first chance for lawmakers to question former i.R.S. Commissioner doug shulman since news broke that the agency had targeted conservative groups. 
>> I'm deeply, deeply saddened by this whole set of events. I've read the i.G.'S report, and I very much regret that it happened and that it happened on my watch. 
>> Woodruff: Shulman's five-year term expired last november. This month, a treasury department inspector general disclosed that i.R.S. Agents had singled out groups seeking tax- exempt status with "tea party," "patriot" or "9/12" in their names. The report also revealed that shulman learned of the practice in may of 2012. Utah republican senator orrin hatch noted that, two months before that date, shulman told congress there was "absolutely no targeting." 
[00:23:28]



>> Mr. Shulman, why have you not come forward before today to correct the record and acknowledge that there was in factropriate screening occurring in the i.R.S., The organization that you headed? 
>> What I knew was not the full set of facts in this report. What I knew sometime in the spring of 2012 was that there was a list that was being used. I knew that the word "tea party" was on the list. Didn't know what other words were on the list. Didn't know the scope and severity of this. I didn't know if groups that were pulled in were groups that would have been pulled in anyways. 
>> Woodruff: Michigan democrat debbie stabenow complained that the targeting by staffers in a cincinnati regional office went on for 18 months. 
>> How could it take so long for senior people at the i.R.S. To find the problem, fix the problem? And was there no ongoing oversight of the employees in cincinnati? 
>> I'm not there to go ask a set of questions of people-- what happened, when, who and how. 
>> But, with all due respect, you were there, though? 
>> I was there. But since this all came to light and the full set of facts are there, I haven't been able to be back there, talking with people doing things. So, let me though just answer your question... 
>> But why didn't you know when you were there? 
>> I agree that this is an issue that when someone spotted it, they should have run up the chain, and they didn't. And why they didn't, I don't know. 
>> Woodruff: The news ultimately came out when an i.R.S. Official, lois lerner, took a prearranged question at a public conference on may 10 and issued an apology. Today, steven miller, who was ousted last week as the acting i.R.S. Commissioner, said it was his idea to get the news out that way. 
[00:25:39]



>> We had our response, we thought we should begin talking about this. We thought we'd get out an apology. The way we did it, we wanted to reach out to hill staff about the same time and come and brief. It did not work out. Obviously, the entire thing was an incredibly bad idea. 
>> Woodruff: The committee also heard from j. Russell george, the treasury inspector general for tax administration who conducted the audit. Idaho republican mike crapo was skeptical of his conclusion that i.R.S. Agents were not driven by politics. 
>> You have simply the reached the conclusion that there was none or that you haven't found it? 
>> It's the latter, that we have not found any, sir. 
>> Because it seems to me that it's almost unbelievable to look at what's happening and then say there's no political motivation here. How could an agency with the power that the internal revenue service has engage in this kind of conduct and it not be politically motivated? 
>> Woodruff: There were also plenty of questions directed at the white house again today, the administration's timeline surrounding who knew what and when about the activities at the i.R.S. Faced mounting scrutiny. Presidential press secretary jay carney said monday that the white house's top lawyer and the chief of staff were told in april about the inspector general's report, but the president was not informed. Today, he said: 
>> There was nothing the president could or should do until that process was completed. And upon the release of that information, the release of the final report, the president moved very quickly to make clear his feeling that the conduct portrayed within it was outrageous and inappropriate and wrong. 
>> Woodruff: Amid the questions and answers, tea party groups protested outside i.R.S. Offices ar the country today, and there will be more tomorrow when the house oversight committee holds its first hearing on the matter. 
[00:27:47]



>> Ifill: Now, to another story that has captured the attention of the news media and of congress. After new revelations about extensive investigations involving the associated press and fox news, three former justice department officials are defending the leak inquiries. Writing in the new york times, they said: White house press secretary jay carney said today the key is to strike the right balance, but what is that balance? For that, we turn to: Floyd abrams, a first amendment lawyer who routinely represents news organizations; and former attorney general michael mukasey, now an attorney in private practice in new york city. Michael mukasey, how far should the government go in these kinds of investigations in your opinion? 
>> Well, there are rules and procedures that are prescribed as to how far they should go and what those rules say is that when it comes to getting information about the records 
-- the telephone records of a reporter-- which is the issue in the a.P. Case-- that they are supposed to, number one, exhaust other alternatives, number two, obviously, recognize that what they're dealing with is something that touches on press freedom, negotiate with the news organization in question if it's possible to do that without prejudicing the investigation. And limit the subpoenas, limit the materials sought to what is absolutely necessary. And the question is whether any or all of that was done here. 
>> Ifill: Floyd abrams, what do you any was any or all of that done here? 
>> Well, I really don't think enough was done here. The only justification for not asking, telling the a.P. That they wanted the phone records is that doing so would interfere with the integrity of the investigation and I just haven't seen anything to persuade me that that is so. If the fear here was-- and this has been suggested in some reports on it-- that a.P. Might go to court, that's a terrible reason. The a.P. Ought to go to court to defend itself and defend its telephone logs and if that takes some more time, well, that's just fine. The one thing you shouldn't do is just to evade the regulations by going right in the direction of the telephone company. 
[00:30:29]



>> Ifill: The administration has said and previous administrations have made this argument as well that this is a matter of national security. That when someone leaks sensitive information that could endanger american lives all bets are off. Is that something that sounds right to you? First to you, mr. Abrams? 
>> Not that way, no. All bets are never off. If there's a national security issue there ought to be a very sophisticated, serious, sober investigation in which every effort as attorney general mukasey was setting forward. Every effort is made first to avoid going to the journalist and here or imposing on their rights in any way. Here they went after a lot of interrogations to be sure, but here they went to the telephone company instead of going to the associated press and I just see no justification for that. 
>> Ifill: Mr. Mukasey, did they go too for? 
>> Well, they seem to have gone too far from what I know with the breadth of the subpoena. As I understand it, they were investigating an incident that was so confidential that it was known only to very few people in government and was not actually briefed even to the leadership in congress or to the oversight committees, the intelligence committees of congress. One of the people whose records they subpoenaed was the congressional correspondent for the a.P.. I can't figure out for the life of me why that was done. So the question is really the breadth of the subpoena. 
>> Ifill: Let's talk for 
-- finisthat thought. 
>> No, go ahead. 
>> Ifill: Let's talk about the breadth of the subpoenas. When is it okay 
-- the administration has said among other things that they were trying to search for the leaker. It's not so much about the reporters but the leakers. Is that the standard which you can imagine applying that it's worth doing what you have to do in order to get to that leak? 
>> Absolutely. And they were that is the person whom you should focus on. The first person they should have focused on when they were dealing with an operation with only a few people is the few people who knew about it. Obviously one of them was the leaker and only when that doesn't prove fruitful should they be looking 
-- should they be casting a wider net and there only the people who participated in the report. Again, I don't understand how the congressional correspondent is involved in that. 
[00:33:01]



>> Ifill: Mr. Abrams, I want to talk to you about the fox news case, which is a little bit different. It's about whether somebody should have been 
-- whether somebody really was 
-- should be involved in a criminal inquiry, whether they should be held CRIMINALLY RESPONSIBLE FOR THEt [Technical difficulties] [technical difficulties] [technical difficulties] [technical difficulties] [technical difficulties] [technical difficulties] 
[00:35:06]


[technical difficulties] [technical difficulties] [technical difficulties] what's the proper balance and how do you negotiate your way to the middle in an argument like that? 
>> Well, you try to strike the balance. You try to find some sort of way to go about your investigation in a way best designed to avoid interfering with the ability of the press to go about its mission. And the worst way you can do that is by starting to accuse journalists themselves of being participants in criminal conduct. I mean, that is the end. That's the most radical change in policy at f this is a policy that we've mean? Years. 
>> Ifill: Mr. Mukasey? 
>> Well, there are two problems with it that I see. Number one is that it subverb it is ability of the american people to find out information. Obviously if 
-- people are not inside the government. The only people inside the government are the people who work for the government. And if the only way that the people have of finding out what the their government is doing is by what is authorized and reported by the government or leaked by government officials-- and, of course, that goes on all the time-- then the ability of people to make up their own minds about what their government is doing is subverted. In addition, obviously, if people who speak to reporters think that their records and their identity is being made known to the government or reporters think that their records and activities are being made known to the government they are going to be hesitant for the reporter side in seeking information and from the sources side in disclosing it. Also, it impedes 
-- that's the first problem is the problem of running a democratic system. The second problem is that the next time there's a national security issue we're going to have a situation like this one in the story of the little boy who cried wolf. When the government cries national security nobody will believe them." 
[00:37:15]



>> Ifill: Former attorney general michael mukasey and first amendment lawyer floyd abrams, thank you both for joining us. 
>> Brown: Now, the tech giant apple is the subject of criticism and scrutiny on capitol hill for using tax practices that margaret warner has the story. 
>> Now, apple executives want the public to focus on the u.S. Taxes the company has paid, but the real issue is the billions in taxes that it has not paid. 
>> Warner: Chairman carl levin laid out the findings of his senate panel's investigative report today. Giant apple, maker of the iphone, ipad and other popular devices has for years used a complex web of irish subsidiaries to avoid paying billions of dollars in taxes to the u.S. Or any other country. That strategy meant apple paid little or no corporate taxes on at least $74 billion in the past four years, according to the report. Saved apple at least $9 billion in u.S. Taxes last year, ranking MEMBER john McCain showed the outrage was bipartisan. 
>> Today, apple has over 100 billion, more than two thirds of its total profits stashed away in an offshore account. That's over $100 billion that are not currently subject to us corporate income taxes and therefore cannot be used to help ease the deficit or help invigorate the same american economy that fostered the creation of this large corporation in the first place. 
>> Warner: After being sworn in, apple c.E.O. Tim cook said his company is america's largest corporate taxpayer, and he offered a vigorous defense of the company's practices. 
>> We pay all the taxes we owe, every single dollar. We not only comply with all laws, we comply with the spirit of the laws. We don't depend on tax gimmicks. 
>> Warner: Nobody was alleging that apple has done anything illegal, and apple's overseas sales now outstrip its revenues from sales at home. Rather, today's hearing was meant to spotlight how apple and other multinational corporations exploit loopholes in u.S. Tax laws, loopholes cook said he believes need to be fixed. 
[00:39:34]



>> Apple has always believed in the simple, not the complex. You can see this in our products and in the way we conduct ourselves. It is in this spirit that we recommend a dramatic simplification of the corporate tax code. 
>> Warner: Levin closed the hearing, the second to examine this issue, by saying "one way or another" the current loopholes cannot remain in place. And more now on the report and the apple story. Charles duhigg has been covering it for the "new york times" and joins me now. Charles, welcome back. First, explain to us how did apple structure itself so that it could avoid paying taxes on its overseas income to any government? I mean, senator levin accused apple of using ghost companies. 
>> It 
-- apple took advantage of loopholes that exist in our tax system and every tax system. For instance, the united states says that a company should be taxed where it's based. For instance, if you have a subsidiary in ireland than ireland should collect taxes on your revenue. Ireland, on the other hand, says is company should be taxed based on where it's controlled out of. So if it's run by people in california, then united states should tax you. Apple was able to take advantage of these conflicting philosophies and say "we've got a company that's technically incorporated in ireland, it's run by people out of california and so there's no taxing authority." And as a result, many of its 
-- many of its subsidiaries don't pay any taxes on tens of billions of dollars of revenue and, in fact, don't even file tax returns to anyone on earth because they slip through these cracks. 
>> Warner: Now the atmosphere at that hearing with one exception was pretty much very critical of apple. What was happen's defense, tim cook's defense other than we do everything 
-- we pay what we legally owe? 
>> That's exactly tim cook's defense and apple's defense is to say, listen, we follow the law. We pay what we're supposed to in every country. It's not our fault if you don't like how the law is written. Secondarily what mr. Cook and others say is listen, when companies make money, when they get these revenues they use them to create jobs and to create new products and to make the world a better place. And so we deserve to have that money so we can use it. And finally what mr. Cook says is that at this point a majority of apple's sales occur outside of the united states and so as a result it shouldn't be subject to u.S. Taxation. Now, that's significantly different from what, for instance, the congressional panel as well as the law of the united states says which is that the u.S. Believes that we should tax where economic value is created. So if you buy an itunes song in portugal and it's downloaded from a server in greece and it's created by a recording artist that lives in new york and the program that made it work is by someone in california, the u.S. Says well, wherever that value was created-- in this case the united states-- that's where taxation should occur. And there's a fundamental difference of opinion on how that law should be interpreted. 
[00:42:35]



>> Warner: Is it clear that all the money in these three big irish subsidiaries was, in fact, all 
-- at least earned overseas in terms of the sales occurring overseas? 
>> It 
-- I think it's pretty clear that the sales occurred overseas. No one is saying that apple is misleading about where the sales themselves occur. The question is how that revenue is passed between subsidiaries. So one of the things that apple does as well as almost every other tech company is that they sell their own intellectual property to one of their subsidiaries. So apple might invent itunes in california, but then sell the intellectual property, the patents around it, to a subsidiary in ireland. Then ireland charges other parts of apple for the use of the itunes technology. So as a result the money ends up in ireland in theory. And this's where it's either taxed or not taxed depending upon how the law is restructured 
>> Warner: Now, this is this isn't the only company this committee has focused on. How widespread is the practice of 
-- with overseas subsidiaries somehow avoiding u.S. Taxes? 
>> It's incredibly widespread. Now, what the congressional panel as well as our own reporting has indicated is that apple is for more aggressive in this and uses either pioneers and creates tactics or uses tactics that we're not aware of any other company using. That being said, there's general policy of particular tech companies trying to lower their tax bill by moving intellectual property and revenues around the world. Almost every single company does this. No c.E.O. Wants to say "i'm the one who volunteered the pay the most taxes." And part of the problem here is that we have a tax system that was written 
-- the last time it WAS OVERHAULED WAS IN THE 1980s When the port their intellectual property and this companies take their fair share. Change is going to occur but there's a big debate over what the fair share means and who should be paying it. 
[00:45:54]



>> Warner: Charles duhigg, "new york times." 
>> Ifill: You can watch all of apple c.E.O. Tim cook's testimony on our youtube page. 
>> Brown: And finally, the legacy of sally ride. Yesterday, president obama announced he would confer the presidential medal of freedom, the nation's highest civilian award, on a woman remembered as a pioneer in space travel and an educator and role model for women in the sciences. It was 1983 when sally ride made history as the first american woman in space. Ride was just 32 at the time, and she said then that she thought her age was more important than her gender. 
>> I guess that I was maybe more excited about getting a chance to fly early than I was about getting to be the first woman. 
>> Brown: Ride was a physicist and one of the first six women chosen for the program. She would fly into space again just a year later. But when her flying days were over, she continued to play an important role in the space program. She served on two investigative boards that examined what went wrong in the challenger and columbia disasters. And after her nasa years, ride focused on engaging young people in science, particularly girls and women. In a 2008 video, she promoted "earthkam," an effort to put cameras on the space station, allowing middle schoolers to takeictures from space. 
>> We provide a web site that allows them to do their calculations, figure out exactly when the station is going to be going over that part of the earth, and then command the camera to take a picture at that second. 
>> Brown: Science education remained sally ride's life's work until she was overcome by pancreatic cancer last july at the age of 61. A celebration of the life and work of sally ride was held last night at the kennedy center here in washington. Our own science correspondent, miles o'brien, who knew ride, served as the emcee. I talked with him yesterday just before the event. Welcome, miles. 
[00:48:01]



>> Good to be here, jeff. 
>> Brown: Was she aware, sally ride aware of being a pioneer and did she feel that responsibility? 
>> Responsibility and she had a lot of discomfort with it. You know, it's interesting. She went into space for the adventure and never really intended to become part of the mythology. You know, I think we use the term "hero" in our culture and very few people fully qualify. I think she does qualify because of what she accomplished and the inspiration she gave others but she was always reluctant to bask in that. The fame was something she saw as a two-edged sword. It allowed her to get phone calls answered. Got her through some doors but she was never comfortable with the adulation that came along with it. 
>> Brown: Describe a little bit more of her wider impact on the space program, right? Because it went even beyond the ride that she did. The ride. 
>> The ride! Yes, it wasn't just the ride. That's a great way of putting it. For her the ride was part of the larger picture. She had tremendous passion for science and the role that women can play in it and really set about to be an inspiration to girls everywhere and did this with her sally ride science program and other programs she got involved in to try to 
-- to get young girls interested in the stem fields, as she called it-- science, technology, engineering and mathematics. That was her life's mission. You talk to a lot of astronauts and their mission was to go space. For her space was a springboard to do something else. 
>> Brown: Where did that come from? 
>> I think for some people it's about the ride, it's about the speed. For her there was something deeper engrained in her. I think's a real sense of a desire to achieve and a desire for women to be on an equal playing field with men, especially when it came to these technical fields where there's huge discrepancy. 
>> Brown: Tell us how spent her years after the shuttle experiences, particularly trying to invoke 
-- I mean instill these stem subjects. 
>> She was all about education and finding ways to inspire young people, particularly girls. And she did it in interesting ways by having cameras in space that allowed kids to participate and be a part of it. By giving them the ability to be a part of science fairs that allowed them to build things and think of ideas and dream great things. She reached a lot of young people by doing this. Of course the problem is so much bigger than one person. She committed her life that that and in addition to that she became a very sage presence at nasa. She was nasa's conscience in many ways. 
[00:50:35]



>> Brown: Well, explain that. Part of it was the disasters who served on the commissions. 
>> She served on both commissions, post-challenger post-colombia. That says something about the time she 
-- that shows testimony interest she held. And it was very important toer in the wake of those accidents that nasa get it right for future. Not 
-- she knew it was dangerous but she knew that space was important to stay in space to continue that engagement with young people. 
>> Brown: When you say conscience with nasa it's that and that kind of thing? 
>> It's interesting. I always think of her 
-- neil armstrong was always thought of as the most cerebral of the "apollo" astronauts. I think of sally ride as the neil armstrong of her era. That vintage of shuttle astronauts who thought about space as a means to talking about much larger things. Is there something larger than space? I don't know. 
>> Brown: It's interesting looking at the setup piece you forget how young she was and the excitement she talks about not being a woman but just getting up so young. 
>> Yeah, I think it's 
-- you know, as I say, I think she was not exactly ready far, for the kind of embrace she got by the american public and guess what? Here's a reality check, folks. It's going to be the 30-ier anniversary for the flight. Hard to imagine how much our country 
-- how much we've come and gone since then. Interestingly, though, that issue that she's cared so much about, science, technology, engineering and mathematics education remains a problem and that discremesy only continues to grow among men and swipl so there's still work to be done. 
>> Brown: And as a person you knew her. I mean, you said that she didn't 
-- she didn't seek the spotlight. 
>> She was a determined person, when she called and she would call frequently there wasn't much time for small talk. She was on a mission always and she wanted to talk about things that were important to her and i had the good fortune to haver in my house and I confided to n her at the time that I had worked out a deal to fly to space on the shuttle and go to the international space station at that time with cnn and she didn't miss a beat, she started talking about all the ways we could partner together to help out young people that she cared so dearly about. So it was always moving forward for her. 
[00:53:00]



>> Brown: Miles o'brien on the life and work of sally ride. Thank you so much. 
>> You're welcome, jeff. 
>> 
>> Ifill: AGAIN, THE MAJOR Developments of the day. Rescue crews sifted through the wreckage of moore, oklahoma, winding down a search for survivors of yesterday's monster tornado. And senators pressed the former head of the internal revenue service, douglas shulman, about targeting conservative groups. He said he didn't tell congress because he knew an inspector general was also investigating. 
>> Brown: Online, social media sites help groups mobilize around a common cause. But what if their message is one of hate or intolerance? Hari sreenivasan tells us more. 
>> Sreenivasan: The simon wiesenthal center, an organization devoted to combating global racism, works with service providers and social networks to identify and disable users with objectionable content. Learn more on the rundown. Are you 50 or older and searching for a job? Ask the headhunter's nick corcodilos says the best thing yo can do is to show a prospective employer exactly how you'll do that job. That's on "making sense."

>> God bless moore. That's this edition of "360." We'll be back one hour from now, another live edition of "360" from moore, oklahoma. "Piers morgan live" starts now. 
>>> This is "piers morgan live." Welcome to our viewers in the united states and around the world. Tonight, a twister so big, you could see it from outer space. Look at these amazing pictures. The tornado 1.3 miles wide as it carved a 17 mile path of destruction through moore, oklahoma. Rated an ef-5 with winds up to more than 200 miles an hour. The damage from the storm expected to top over $1 billion. Tonight, survival and hope. 24 dead, more than 200 injured, and incredibly, 100 people pulled alive from the wreckage. We'll hear more from their stories later. Also, the family who emerged from the shelter where they hid from the storm's fury to see this. The oklahoma photographer who caught this incredible moment on camera. Plus, what promises to be an emotional interview with country superstar toby keith devastated over what's happened his hometown. S he's just landed in oklahoma tonight and is rushing to the scene of the disaster where he will talk exclusively to me. Cnn's chris cuomo and gary tuchman are in moore. Chris, you took to the air for a helicopter tour of this devastation. Let's take a quick look at what you saw. 
>> We're going to take you through the tornado's path beginning to end. If you look down, you see the debris field, there's a brown line going across that field. That is the tornado's path. You'll see what happens when that path starts to get into a populated area. Look at the difference between having your home intact and having it just be a pile of splinters. At its widest point the tornado was 1.3 miles wide. But its area of concentration was much more narrow. What you're looking down at now is where we were this ing. The big building is the movie theater. To it is the bowling alley. You'll see the little brown strips where the alleys were. Next to that is the medical center which is completely decimated. 
[00:02:12]



>> You can see much more of chris' helicopter tour tomorrow morning on "starting point." He joins me now. Chris, you covered many storms, many disasters. Put this one into context for me in terms of scale. 
>> Reporter: I think it is difficult right now, piers, because it's so fresh. When you're in these situations, everything's so immediate to you, and it gives it a very heightened sense. That said, I don't believe there's anything that does violence the way a tornado does. It was described today by the lieutenant governor as a lawn mower blade and you know, tornado is the spanish word, tornad, to turn. It cuts through things the way a hurricane doesn't, the way even a wildfire doesn't destroy things. So you get the randomness of fire where some homes are chosen, others aren't. The sustained violence and intensity of a hurricane. There's probably nothing worse. That's why we wanted to get up above it to get some perspective of the randomness and just the violence of how this community was torn apart. 
>> I also heard an extraordinary thing today, that the power of this tornado at one stage, people thought was maybe three times the power of the hiroshima bomb, for example. When you hear statistics like that it gives you some sense of just how extreme the violence is and we saw those images of it sitting for quite sustained peris of time on certain areas, just obliterating everything that was underneath it. 
>> Reporter: Absolutely. Nothing stands a chance in the path of this type of natural force. You see it on every level here on the ground. The girders behind me from this bowling alley, most of them are an inch thick of solid steel, twisted like a pretzel. Yet at the same time, piers, i know this is something you like to pick up on in these situations as well, the strength of this tornado is every bit matched and bettered by the strength of the people here. We heard about 100 rescues. Those are official numbers. We've been down these streets, piers. They have been pulling each other out of rubble. The shelter numbers have been low because people pull you in like family here. Oklahomans are very special. They have dealt with situations like this, it's almost part of the culture here, and they respond with resolve that is unusual. I think that that is why a place like this is able to heal, is able to move forward. They say it's a prayerful community and it is that, and other things as well. It's one where people come out, they do the right thing. There's someone who just started a barbecue randomly up the street from here just to feed people who may need it. It's a special place and it's going to need it because the devastation here is about as thick as I've seen. 
[00:04:42]



>> Chris, just finally, clear up for me if you can the confusion over the death toll, because last night, on the midnight show we did, we were told by the chief medical examiner's office that it could be as many as 91 people. They were confirming 51, with 40 more bodies apparently on the way. That was dramatically reduced this morning. What was the explanation for that? 
>> Reporter: With a little bit of caution, they don't really know the numbers yet, okay. I KNOW THAT THE DIFFERENT M.E.s, The medical examiners have been meeting trying to get their numbers straight. They don't really know yet. They could go up. So with that caveat in place journalistically, I'm happy that we had the wrong numbers going forward on this. The reason for it is information is sloppy in these situations. They can't get people in the field. A lot of it's duplicative. A lot of it is word of mouth. A lot of these agencies aren't used to working together and frankly it's just difficult. There's so much emotional pain, there's so much trauma on the ground that the numbers can get messy. That's why we try to be careful but this is a very rare instance where we are adjusting down at this point, and I'm happy for that. I hope it stays. 
>> I couldn't agree more. Chris, thank you very much indeed. Gary tuchman, I will go to you now. What's been the community and volunteer response to the devastation, because as chris was saying, they've all come together in the most remarkable way but it remains an absolutely devastating scene. 
>> Reporter: It's unbelievably devastating, piers. Earlier today, right now it's sunny out but earlier today, it was storming, it was hailing and it was actually quite cold. And people who weren't victimized, whose houses were fine, we saw them all over the city of moore today going t their neighbors' houses that were damaged, picking through, helping them out in the cold and the rain and the hail. And it was just amazing seeing that spirit as chris mentioned. One of the things we notice when we cover these tornadoes, the first thing people want when they come back to houses like this that are gone, they want to find their pictures. They want to find heirlooms, videotapes, things that mean something to them, things that can't be replaced. We watched a lot of that today. 
>> Absolutely. Extraordinary moving scenes, so many tales of heroism and courage. In terms of the operation to rescue people, they're saying that that effectively is over. They believe they've covered all the ground now and found everyone that needs to be found but I'm about to interview somebody who still hasn't located her grandparents. Is it possible that there are still people that are trapped? 
[00:07:06]



>> Reporter: You know, when we were in haiti in january of 2010, rescues were happening days and weeks later so we can always hope for that. We always pe that happens. What is a marvel, though, I've never seen such damage in such a small area. It's comparable to what we saw in joplin two years ago. The death toll obviously is way o high at 24 and it may go higher. But this easily from the damage I'm seeing and from my years of covering tornadoes, if you would have told me that 500 people died in this tornado with the amount of damage we saw, I would not have been surprised. Right now, it seems absolutely amazing that the number's as low as it is. As chris said, we hope it stays that way. 
>> It does seem absolutely miraculous. Thank you very much indeed. 
>>> Joining me now is cassandra jenkins, whose grandparents have been missing since the storm hit. Her daughters are with her along with her father and husband. This is obviously an incredibly worrying time. Explain to me exactly what happened to your grandparents. 
>> Well, I mean, at this time we're not even exactly sure. All we know is that their home is still left standing, however, they have not been seen or heard from since the storm hit. We've located or we've tried to locate them at every hospital, every shelter, every red cross, anything that we can possibly reach out to, we have and they're still not located. THEY ARE BOTH IN THEIR 80s. My grandmother suffers from some dementia. My grandfather has some heart trouble. We know they've been without medication now for two days which is scary in itself. We are just very, very worried. 
>> Just to go over the chronology of their movements, what we know is they left their home in the heart of moore to go to a funeral in a neighboring town. The church service ended i believe at 2:30. Everybody at the funeral saw them leave and it was believed they were heading back to moore? 
[00:09:14]



>> That is correct. They left the funeral home about 35, 45 minutes away at 2:30, between 2:15 and 2:30, and we don't know if they made it back to moore before the storm hit or not. So at this point, we are not sure if they're in the city of moore somewhere or if they're somewhere between moore and maysville. We have tracked back and forth numerous family members trying to find anything, any clues that they could possibly find, and nothing. 
>> What are the authorities telling you when you've asked them about this? 
>> Well, the moore police department and the highway patrol both, we wanted to put out a silver alert on them since they are both very elderly and in bad health, and we are told they are not doing that at this time because of the catastrophe, and all we can do is file missing persons reports with the red cross and put them on registration lists here and there. They really have been of no help at all. And we've kind of been left to our own devices to try to find them. 
>> Obviously it could be that they heard about a warning and ey went off to another town and you just haven't been able to get hold of them. They don't have cell phones or it could be they went back to moore and they are still trapped somewhere, we can't rule that out. Anything could have happened. But I can quite understand why you would be so desperate to have any kind of news. We're showing their picture again now on the screen. I urge anyone who is watching this, any of the viewers who have any knowledge at all of thomas and claudia fouch, look at their pictures. They have not been seen since this tornado struck yesterday and if you do see them, tweet me immediately, @piersmorgan or @piersmorganlive. Hopefully there's good news they are safe somewhere, just unable to contact you. Just describe for me, cassandra, what kind of people are they? If people may have come across them or seen them, describe them, their character, their personalities. 
[00:11:27]



>> They are god given people. I mean, they are very loving. They would give the shirt off their backs to anybody. They love their family. They love their grandkids, their great grandkids. This is their life is these kids and their family, and their church family. And it is very out of character. They have never gone this far without trying to reach out to somebody. They mean a lot to a lot of people. 
>> Well, listen, my heart goes out to you and to your family. I wish you all the very best in tracking them down. I hope and pray that this ends happily for you and that they are somewhere safe. Again, I urge anybody watching this who has any information about thomas and claudia fouch to contact the authorities, to contact the family, if you know them, or to tweet us, at the show or just call cnn if you have any information. Because we need to find this elderly couple as soon as possible. Cassandra and your family, thank you very much for joining me. 
>> Thank you so much. 
>> Heartbreaking stories. So many from this terrible tragedy. The stories of herois at two elementary schools in moore are equally amazing. Joining me now is david wheeler. His son gabriel is a third gradert briarwood elementary. With us on the phone is gabriel's teacher, julie simon, who protected him during the twister. Welcome to you all. David, let me ask you first of all, where were you when you heard there was going to be this huge tornado? What did you do? 
>> Well, I'm an educator in the putnam city school district and I had to stay at my school to make sure our students were safe, and I was watching the tv as the tornado was heading down towards gabriel's school, and as soon as it hit the school, I was able to just rush home and just go 100 miles an hour on the highway and went through neighborhoods and had to run about a mile, and got on a couple trucks and took about three and a half hours to find him. 
[00:13:33]



>> That moment when you found him, describe that to me. 
>> Happiest day of my life. It was just wonderful. It was the worst day built into one of the happiest moments of my life. I already knew my daughter and my wife were safe and all i cared about at that time was my son, and other family members, and when I saw him run down the street with miss simon, everything was okay for us at that moment. 
>> Gabriel, let me talk to you for a moment. Obviously a terrifying experience for you. Tell me what was going through your mind as this tornado struck. 
>> I was really scared. Just the ceiling collapsed on me and I was really scared. Everyone kept on crying. It was a really scary moment. 
>> And your teacher, I believe, was extremely brave. Tell me about that. 
>> Yes. During the time when the ceiling collapsed, she put her hand over our heads and she got a little cut on her hand because of a brick. 
>> We've got your teacher, julie simon, on the phone now. Can you hear me? 
>> Yes, I can. 
>> You had an extraordinary experience. It sounds like so many teachers, you put your own safety to one side and just were desperate to protect these children. Tell me about what was going through your mind as this all happened. 
>> I just wanted my babies beside me. I had seven kids left with me that were in my classroom and we were all sticking together, and I just grabbed them and held them close and gabe was just wonderful. Gabe, I'm sorry I couldn't make it up there. I wanted to be there but I only had 30 minutes to get there and I didn't think that I would get there to come and stand beside you. But you were so brave and I'm so proud of you. You did everything that you were taught to do and you guys didn't look up, you kept your heads down and when all that stuff was flying down, you know, you kept yourself safe and I just 
-- I'm so connected, he I'll forever be connected with my students of this year, going through this with me. 
[00:15:50]



>> Julie, i, like so many people, just have seen this horrifying tornado on a tv screen, but you've actually lived through it. What was the experience like in terms of the power and the damage that it was causing? 
>> It was like the three little pigs. The big bad wolf coming to huff and puff on your house, I swear. There was this monster coming and we could hear it approaching, and the debris was falling, we could hear the houses falling across the street and we heard the freight train sound and the debris got louder and closer. You knew that it was coming right straight for you. You knew it was getting closer and it was faster, and you weren't feeling any of it yet, so you're thinking well, maybe it's all outside. But then you started feeling it fall on you and then we didn't think we were going to make it. We're just so lucky to be alive. We just didn't think we would be looking up and seeing the sky. I think the insulation and the sheetrock that fell on us and broke all to pieces, I think that that protected us from the heavier things that fell on us, because it kind of cushioned it and I really believe that. 
>> Absolutely miraculous escape. Gabriel, what do you want to say to your teacher? 
>> I want to say she's a really nice teacher and she was the best teacher I ever had. She's really, really nice. 
>> We love her. 
>> David, you as the father, as you say, it was the worst day of your life for a few hours, then became one of the best days of your life when you realized that your boy had come through this. You owe a lot to this teacher and to so many teachers. They have all shown incredible bravery. What would you say to her? 
>> I don't know if we can say anything. She helped save my son's life. She helped save other students' lives. We're proud of her and we all take an oath as an educator to protect the kids, and she fulfilled that duty better than anyone, and so we want to thank her and she's a member of our family for the rest of our lives. She'll be a part of it forever. There's nothing that we can give to her that will repay her. We just thank you, julie. And we love you. 
[00:18:10]



>> Well, I love you, too. I didn't do anything that anybody else wouldn't have done. We all just helpe each other and you know, we just 
-- we just did what we had to do. I don't feel like a hero. 
>> What we were trained to do. 
>> We did what we had to do. 
>> You know, julie, I just have to say, there have been so many appalling incidents recently in america where teachers, I'm thinking of sandy hook and other incidents, and now this, where teachers have really shown outstanding heroism. You always say the same thing. We just did our jobs. But you do more than your jobs. I think what you did yesterday with these children, I'm sure david would agree with me and gabriel certainly would, was just incredible heroism and on behalf of everyone involved and all the children, all the families, that you helped save yesterday, I just want to thank you very much indeed. 
>> Well, thank you. We're just glad to be alive. 
>> She is a hero. 
>> Yes, she's a true hero. David, I'm so happy for you that your little boy's okay. And that your school, although badly devastated, wasn't as bad as the other school where so many other young children lost their lives. I couldn't begin to imagine, I'm the father of four children, three boys myself, I can only imagine the horror at must have been going through your mind as you saw this devastation. I'm so glad it turned out well for you. 
>> Thank you. I just know the community all came together and that's what we do in oklahoma. We just pull together as family and that's all we do. Here in oklahoma. 
>> You're amazing people. No one more amazing than you, julie. Thank you all very much. 
>> I love you, gabe. 
>> Thank you. You hear that? She said she loves you. 
>> I love you, too. 
>> Thanks again, everybody. What an amazing story. Coming next, hometown heartbreak. I talk to country music superstar toby keith, who grew up in moore, oklahoma and rushed back tonight for a first-hand look at the destruction. Bill. Hey! Are you in town for another meeting?

>>> We had to pull a car out of the front hallway off a teacher. I don't know what that lady's name is but she had three little kids underneath her. Good job, teach. 
>> A father's tearful thank you to the teacher who saved children from a tornado. The devastation in moore, oklahoma is heartbreaking to see and unimagizable if it's your hometown. Joining me is country superstar toby keith who is from moore. Toby, thank you for joining me. I know you just got back to moore. Tell me your reaction on seeing this utter devastation. 
>> Well, we flew out yesterday after there was another tornado that a lot of people aren't talking about that came through the day before that went to shawnee, and this one, I flew out of here, went to nashville. My sister's house is about three miles down here. She got hit so I needed to come back and assist her so I flew back in and we circled in and got to see the devastation. It's pretty awful. 
>> I mean, moore is pretty much your hometown. These are streets that you've walked, that you've lived in, that your family have lived in. It must feel horrendous to see what's happened to it. 
>> Yeah. Right where we're standing right here, I literally grew up and went to grade school four streets over here in the plaza towers is the next grade school over from south gate. I've been on, biked and walked up all these streets for years as a kid. Got a lot of family and friends here. I want to tell everybody to contact salvaton army or red cross, we don't have a laundry list what to do here. We just got on the ground. These people are resilient and they're helping each other out. They're as prepared as anybody. And they'll rebound, but right now, the first thing to do is probably call red cross, salvation army, support that and then they'll get a laundry list together and then we can help get it started. 
>> Toby, you said your sister lives three miles, I think you said. Your mother I believe was also in the path of this tornado. Is she okay? 
[00:25:25]



>> She's fine. It missed her by about maybe three quarters of a mile north of her but my sister, it got her house. It didn't completely annihilate it and take it away. She gets to keep her stuff. But the house is not livable. But I had to get back here and help her board it up so we landed and went straight over there. But I saw it come circling back in today, couple hours ago, i got to see it from the airplane. The cameras won't show the damage that you can see with your own eye. It's pretty amazing. 
>> That's what people are telling me who are on the scene there. Have you ever seen anything quite like this in your life? 
>> Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. This is a bad one. But '99 was bad. We've had a lot of them, a lot of these tornadoes that don't get reported that aren't quite on the ground this long, but oklahoma's prepared. They have some of the best meteorologists in the world. We knew last thursday that this super cell was going to be in here with the dry line and it was perfect symptoms for disaster. So people were prepared as they can be and mother nature's just not going to be tamed every time. 
>> You know these people better than most. Describe the resilience as you described it of the people of moore. 
>> Well, I was telling people earlier, I said, you know, this little neighborhood we're standing right here, you go down five streets and there's not much damage. Those people are helping these people. Maybe 20 years ago, their forefathers were, these people were down there helping those. When they cut through here like this, annihilate, first thing people do is get you transportation, get water, take care of your kids, you know, pray for the ones that 
-- be glad you made it through and pray for the ones that lost people in these things but mother nature, as violent as that thing was, bad thing about it, it didn't just pass through and skip and hop. It just sat in one place for a long time and it churned and churned and it was moving alovg good, then it would stop and just churn. It was very violent. 
[00:27:27]



>> You obviously remember the 1999 tornado. How does this compare in terms of the scale of the devastation? Is it worse? 
>> Everything I've heard, they're very close as far as miles per hour but you're talking about one of them being 225 and one being 210 or something. There's not much difference. They both started at the same place, they were both on the ground a long time. This one, this particular tornado started on st. Pat's and veered straight off into the east for awhile. The other one kind of stayed to the northeast. Other than that, they looked identical. This street looks just like the streets did in that one. It's going to happen once in awhile. But the good thing is we're resilient here. I'm proud to live here in this town and I've always called it home, I've always lived here. I know exactly by living four streets over here, having sheetrock fly through your window 4:00 in the morning, it was time to get in the cellar and you just have to be resilient, get back up. A year from now, these people will be vibrant and moving around and god bless the ones that didn't make it. 
>> Toby, finally, I hear you may be putting together some kind of benefit concert for what's happened. Tell me about that. 
>> Well, always when these things happen, music people get together and I've had 500 text messages from people all over the music world saying what are we doing, you know, we want to help. That's just everybody's way. Like I said, this just happened yesterday. I just got on the ground so I've talked to people at ou, they've called me, maybe use the stadium. There's some more people trying to put one on down chesapeake arena in oklahoma city. I don't know if everybody's going to unite, whatever. I'm in and moore knows I'm going to be here. But hopefully, hopefully the next couple days, we can sort it all out. I would say immediately, red cross and salvation army's the best place to help these people right now. 
>> We certainly would love to help with any benefit ideas you have. I do appreciate you coming to talk to us tonight. You literally landed within the last couple hours and I know that you've got a lost work to do tonight with family, friends and other people in the area. Thank you very much indeed. 
[00:29:40]



>> Okay. See you. 
>> Toby keith will give anderson cooper a first-hand tour of moore, oklahoma, his hometown on "ac 360" tomorrow at 8:00.

[00:33:26]



>>> the painstaking search for survivors of the deadly tornado in moore, oklahoma may be nearing its end. Joining me is mayor glenn lewis and fire chief gary burg. Welcome to you both. Mayor, let me start with you. What is the status of the city of moore tonight? 
>> What is the what, I'm sorry? 
>> What is the status. Are we in a situation now where you believe everybody is accounted for? 
>> Yes, sir, I do believe that. I think most everybody's been accounted for. Right now we're going to go into the cleanup process. We'll still be looking but i think we've gone past that now and we've already started the cleanup process and a lot of the sti city, we've got the traffic lights on on the south end of town and we're working on the rest of the city getting the power back on so we've got our water situation and our sewer back online. So we're in pretty good shape as far as that goes. 
>> I had a very moving interview with a woman called cassandra jenkins whose grandparents have disappeared and were last seen about 2:30 yesterday, believed to be heading back into moore. Is it possible that they could still be somewhere just not found, trapped or whatever? 
>> It could be. That's quite possible. They may have gone on a trip out of town, I don't know. That's the first I've heard of this. 
>> They were suggesting they haven't had much help and clearly it's been very chaotic there. Would you be prepared to take a look at it for them, because they seem pretty desperate for some kind of information. 
>> Sure. We actually have a red cross station set up to relocate people and to 
-- for relatives to check in on them, and a lot of those have happened and maybe she should look at the red cross situation, it would be the first place I would check. And they have an online registry as well. 
>> We can maybe put you in touch and 
-- 
>> I'll be glad to take a look at it. 
[00:35:27]



>> We will reveal the details of the car they were driving also before the end of the show, if anybody sees it, we can hopefully try and find out what happened to them. Fire chief, this has clearly been an awful thing to have to deal with for you and your men. Tell me about what it is like in reality having to literally pick up the pieces of the wreckage after this kind of tornado. 
>> Well, we've been through several tornadoes and it's kind of trial by fire. I'm very blessed with well trained men that step up to the challenge and we have lots of help from all the surrounding cities and all the communities in the city of oklahoma and in moore and in the nation. They come from everywhere to help us and we have been very blessed with all the help and with the police officials, the fire officials, all the emergency management teams, and we can't say thank you enough to these people. 
>> I think you guys have all done an amazing job. That's the general consensus of everybody. I think it's miraculous that the death toll at the moment seems to be at 24, given the pictures we've seen and the devastation that was wrought. I thank you both, mr. Mayor and to you, fire chief, on all the work you and your people have done. Thank you very much indeed. 
>> Thanks for reporting our story. Thank you very much. 
>> It's an important story to report. 
>>> Now I want to turn to a teacher with an extraordinary story. Suzanne haley was impaled by the leg of a desk as she protected her students at briarwood elementary. We should warn you some of the photographs taken are pretty graphic. She joins me now on the phone. Suzanne, we're looking at a picture which tells it all, really. Your leg was literally speared, we believe it's by the leg of one of the children's tables. Describe to me what happened. 
>> Well, we were aware of the situation, the impending weather. It progressively got worse and the fastest time ever, it just seemed like it was so, so quick. We were taking our tornado precautions, we could hear it approaching. It sounded like a jet,t low, coming closer and closer. We crowded the children under desks and me and a fellow teacher, you know, put ourselves in front of the desks that the children were under and 
-- 
[00:37:56]



>> we're actually looking at you speak at a picture that you've supplied to us. A remarkable picture. It's of the children in the classroom with you and they're all in I guess the kind of crash position, bracing themselves for the tornado. 
>> Interior wall. 
>> They have been trained to do this before? 
>> Yes. This would be our tornado precaution. We're on an interior wall. I was actually in the next class over where we had put 
-- we had a fewer amount of kids, we put desks up against the wall and got them underneath and like i said, the fellow teacher and i put ourselves in front of the desks to avoid exposure to debris that might hit the children. 
>> And you had two children of your own, your two daughters, miranda and ashley. Were they in the same room as you? 
>> Yes, they were under the desks. You know, it just, it got louder and louder and we just continued to pray that, you know, it would pass, it would pass, and it didn't. And the roof went and it just 
-- the wall came in and landed right on top of us, on the desks. Initially I thought something, you know, large and heavy was just on my leg and I couldn't move, none of us could move. We finally got to roll around and kind of get out of the way and I asked my daughter if she could see if that was something that was just on my leg, that could be lifted, that I could pull out, and she realized and screamed that it was in my leg. And amazingly by the grace of god, I kept it together. I couldn't go into hysterics in front of my children, in front of the other students. I had to be calm for them and you ow, not even til after surgery when I came out of anesthesia did I lose it. But regardless, I'm so blessed, that it could have been so worse. It went underneath the bone, a clean wound that's going to heal. It's going to be about three months of recovery and therapy, and unfortunately, I didn't have a choice in which hospital I got taken to in the back of a pickup, and my insurance may not be covering this hospital because it's not under this plan. So they've actually set up a relief fund for me to help me out as I'm a single mother, with approaching recovery and therapy and expenses getting through this whole ordeal on top of finding my vehicle in the pond next to the school. 
[00:40:50]



>> Wow. 
>> It's definitely going to be a great help with this fund that's set up. 
>> We're going to put the details of the fund on our website and I'll tweet about that as well because we want to make sure you get help. Because you showed outstanding heroism like many teachers have done clearly to save many children's lives. It must have been a moment where you thought we're all going to die here and you 
-- 
>> I didn't know what to think. I just continued to pray and like julie said, it's nothing anybody wouldn't do. These children, we see their smiles, their tears, every day in and out, and we love them. And they're our babies just as much as my babies were in the room with me, you know. We wanted each and every one of them to be safe. 
>> I'm looking at the picture again of this extraordinary injury you sustained. I'm so grateful that you're going to be okay and make a full recovery. What have you done with that leg which has gone inside your leg, the table leg? Did you keep it? 
>> Oh, yeah. At the moment, they were putting me under for surgery, I heard the word hacksaw and I just thought okay, it's time to go to sleep. But they did bag it up and it's my souvenir, my trophy. My daughters play softball, they got trophies. Now I got a trophy, too. 
>> You showed amazing bravery and your spirit about all this is quite remarkable. I can only thank you as i thanked julie earlier. You teachers did an amazing job. If I had kids at that school, i would be so proud of what you did and so grateful. So thank you very much. 
>> Oh, thank you. It was my pleasure for all these kids and we are so blessed that there was such minimal injuries. 
>> Yeah. A real miracle. 
>> We can't all say that in the city. It's hard, hard time to go through. 
>> A very, very hard time. Suzanne haley, thank you very much indeed. 
[00:42:51]



>> Thank you. 
>> Another hero teacher. 
>>> Coming up, the doctor who was working in the e.R. When the twister struck. Cheerios cholesterol as part of a heart healthy diet. That's true. ...But you still have to go to the gym. ??? The one and only, Cheerios ??? nom. ??? The one and only, Cheerios ??? 
[00:46:11]



>>> The moore medical center is in ruins tonight after a direct hit from the tornado. The hospital wasn't just housing patients. Up to 300 people had gone there believing it was safer than being at home. Joining me is dr. Stephanie barnhart, who was in the emergency room when the twister struck. Doctor, thank you so much for joining me. It must have been quite a night for you last night. Tell me about it. 
>> Well, I don't think it all hit me until this morning, actually. I was still on go mode, I guess you could say. After the events, we were set up a triage area and took care of patients as they came to see us, then we had lost power at my house so we were trying to figure out what to do, and i think I did just crash and didn't really think about it until this morning, and that was when, you know, kind of the events of everything that happened was really heavy and on my heart, and it was wow, i couldn't believe it. 
>> How much warning did you get to get out of there? 
>> Well, we actually stayed in the hospital, but we had 
-- i think the hospital did a great job of giving us some warning. They sent out three different alerts to us, overhead paging. I would guess maybe 30, 45 minutes from the time that we first knew that there was a tornado wch which we hear that often here in oklahoma so we don't really know what to think of that one. But we got the warning and then we actually got a tornado alert, which tells us that I've never heard that before so I knew that there was something coming our way. 
>> What was it like to actually experience the full blast of this tornado? 
>> It was 
-- I've lived here in oklahoma all my life and I've seen them, I've been around them, but I've never actually been through one, and it is indescribable. I mean, you can hear the roar of the sound as it's coming toward you, it was so loud, and just the pressure that you felt, like your ears were popping and just the pressure around you, you were shaking and trembling and it was unbelievable. 
[00:48:17]



>> When you woke up today and saw the scale of what had gone on, do you feel as I do that it's bordering on miraculous that the death toll at the moment is at 24 and not much, much higher? 
>> Yeah. It is very miraculous and I give all the credit to jesus and god. I know that he was protecting us. We were 
-- the area that we were in as far as the e.R. Patients, we had some inpatients in a particular area of the hospital that was unscathed. There was one ceiling tile that was down and that was it. So we didn't even realize until I stepped out of those double doors that I even knew that something to that magnitude had happened. And I don't think I even still got it until we were outside of the hospital and saw across the street, you know bowling alley and different areas that were just devastated. It was amazing. 
>> Pretty extraordinary night. Doctor, you did an amazing job. Dr. Stephanie barnhart and all your staff. Congratulations. Thank you on behalf of everyone that you helped last night. 
>> Thank you. I don't deserve any of the credit. I just did my job. 
>> Well, you do, but i appreciate that. Thank you very much. 
>> Thanks. 
>>> Another hero of the night. You heard my interview with cassandra jenkins earlier and her missing grandparents. They are thomas and claudia fouch, last seen driving a 2008 red extended cab ford f-150 pickup with the license number 998-aop. I'll say that again. 998-aop.

>>> There have been some staggering images from the disaster zone in oklahoma. The damage is so widespread and graphic, this picture may be the most notable so far. Joining me now on the phone is a man who took that picture, paul helster, a stock photographer in oklahoma. Welcome to you, paul. What extraordinary pictures you took. You were there within five minutes. What was going through your mind as you raced to the scene and then realized what happened? 
>> Well, of course, an adrenaline rush with the situation that was happening. I just got through photographing the tornado itself and then turned up north and was trying to intercept the damage, cutting through an estuary when I came across the school. Just at the moment, the teachers were trying to bring all the kids out of the school, those that could get out, anyway. And a lot of triangle of emotion, children crying for their parents, of course, their moms. And it was a very emotional time. 
>> Yeah, I'm noticing you were doing a job and doing it extremely well. But from a human perspective, you must have been thinking what on earth has happened to this area that I know so well? 
>> Yes, exactly. Well, I had also covered the 
-- practically the same area 14 years earlier with the may 3rd tornado of '99. So I was practically in the same area. But, still, every time you see any kind of tornado damage, it is shocking. And especially to be on it that quickly and when it's in the very height of its emotion, it's very emotional. 
>> And, paul, you said that the other one in '99, we've lost many people in this. But would you say this is a bigger devastation than the one from 1999? I know of the local papers, it may have been yours that said that, but do you believe that to be the case? 
[00:55:44]



>> It's really difficult to tell. From myself, having seen them both from the air and from the ground, this one is close, but i don't know, myself, if it is as strong or if it's quite as much damage. The facts and figures will tell. 
>> They are both awesomely powerful pictures. Paul, thank you very much. And we'll be right back.

=======================================================

E learned the name of the first victim of this story. 9-year-old janay hornsby who was found at plaza towers. Our prayers go to her family and all the grieving families, the victims of this terrible storm. The governor talked about the school. 
>> Our hearts and prayers are certainly with those that have lost their loved ones. It has been very, very hard experience. A heartbreaking experience. Especially the loss of children in the schools themselves. It was very surreal coming upon the school because there was no school. There was just debris. 
>> President obama declared a federal disaster area and promised victims will get help on the path to recovery. 
>> You will not travel that path alone. Your country will travel with you. Fueled by our faith in the almighty and our faith in one another. So our prayers are with the people of oklahoma today, and we will back up those prayers with deeds for as long as it takes. 
>> New nasa video taken from space shows the massive tornado system as it spawned on monday. The national weather service now says it was the most powerful level of tornado, an ef-5. With winds more than 200 miles per hour. As the storm cut a 17-mile path through oklahoma. Joining me now live from moore, oklahoma, is the weather channel's mike bettes. Mike, good evening and thank you for beink on. 
>> Yeah, rev, good evening to you. Just imagine some of the horror these residents went through. And you had to be in one of these. A concrete, reinforced, underground storm shelter to survive this. That's exactly what some of the residents did. Then you emerge after the tornado. And you see this. You know, your neighborhood is just wrecked. This is what happened. And we actually talked to a gentleman, a guy that actually lives next door to the folks 
-- these are neighbors that have this storm shelter. This is where he lives. He was outside. He was trying to get a view of the tornado himself. He loves weather. He loves tornadoes. Doesn't have a storm shelter himself. This is his bedroom right here. 
[00:02:27]



>> Wow. 
>> This is where he would have gone to bed last night. Absolutely amazing. He takes shelter right there in his bathroom that doesn't even exist anymore. The tub is off in that debris. He started throwing a mattress on himself and gone in there, he'd have had no chance. So he took a left turn, went right in that store shter, al. I got to tell you it was the right choice. If he hadn't done that god knows what would have happened to him. So many people in this area now trying to recover. 
>> When the tornado was approaching, people were going to the storm shelters. Some of them reluctantly. And then they'd come out and everything they had and saw when they went I is just gone. 
>> Yeah. It's gone. I mean, every worldly possession that they have is gone. The gentleman that we talked to that lives right here, his name's sky. He can't salvage a single thing from his home, truly. Neither can his neighbors. Imagine that, al. How your life just changes truly in a matter of seconds. You run from your house. You hop in a cellar. You shut the door. It's a roar of a train overhead. It lasts for a few seconds. You open the door, you come out and your world has changed. I don't know if any of us can put ourselves in those shoes, but they've done that here. 
>> Now, mike, walk to the cellar. Because I want to see the distance from these homes to the cellar, then as they come back out. As you walk, how much warning, how much time did they have before it was go in the cellar or it's going to be too late? What kind of time period are we talking? 
>> Well, they had a decent warning on this. About 16 minutes before it came. But, you know, people here, they kind of want to look at it themselves. They're so used to tornadoes. They want to go outside, take a look. The gentleman we talked to said he maybe had a minute or so to get in the cellar. He finally realized it was way too big. Hopped in here. Came all the way back in here. He then shuts the door, pulls the chain shut with this chain. In there truly for seconds. Hops back out. It's about a 30-foot run to get in there. I can only imagine, al, that may have been the most terrifying 30 feet of his life. Could you imagine? 
[00:04:38]



>> Now, they run in the shelter. They hear it go overhead. And I don't think people around the country understand the tremendous impact. Because it's almost right upon them before they can realize how strong and wide this is. 
>> Yeah, absolutely. I mean, you don't really comprehend. Because sometimes it's just too dark. Maybe there's too much debris. Krou don't really know how big the storm is until you feel it. Your years will pop because the pressure is really low. The door will shake. A lot of instanlss with these shelters, the door will be ripped off. That's why they put chains on them like this to keep the door in place so the people inside don't actually get sucked out by the tornado. Because it has a lot of upward motion in the tornado. Then you've got a lot of debris that's ftying around. The pure wind speed and debris hitting homes like this, you'd have had very little chance to survive if you were actually in the home. You'd have had to have been underground down there a good six feet. 
>> This is utterly amazing. The people you spoke with today that survived, what are they saying to you was their reaction? Was it shock? How did they feel when this was going on? Because, as you said, they had lived through other tornadoes. This clearly was something that they'd never experienced. 
>> Well, I think, two things. I think shock for one. Because you just don't think it's going to happen to you. And then I think once they realized that they're okay and they survived, I think there's a peace. They're at peace then. And they have perspective. They say, well, you know what, it's just a home. It's just a car. I can get a new one but I can't replace me. So I think you put their lives in perspective and maybe allow them to appreciate life a little bit more in that instant than they ever did before. 
>> I hope it makes all of us look at life in a different perspective, because it could be any of us. Mike bettes, thank you so much for your time this evening. 
>> You bet. 
>>> Joining me now is oklahoma city mayor mick cornett. Mayor cornett, thanks for coming on the show tonight. 
[00:06:45]



>> Good to be with you, al. Just wish it was under different circumstances. 
>> And so do i. And we certainly, all of us, have our prayers for you and all of your constituents there. 
>> Thank you. 
>> What can you tell us about the recovery right now just 24 hours later? 
>> Well, it's a very awe inspiring situation here. I was able to tour the site this morning and then flew over it in a helicopter to get a look at it from the air. I can't explain to you just how devastating ground zero is. It's amazing that anyone walked out of that alive. Piles of debris four feet high as far as you can see in any direction. Children's toys. Mattresses. Cars standing on end. Trees with the bark torn off of them. 
>> Wow. 
>> Yet, people survived over and over again. There's tremendous stories of courage out there. I want to thank the media for that advanced warning. That technology is wonderful, and it saved hundreds of lives in oklahoma city. 
>> Are you getting all the help you need so far? 
>> Well, I suppose we are. You know, I think you can't just snap your fingers and put people's lives back together. Certainly you can't put a blanket statement that addresses all of the individual needs. Some people lost their kids. Some people lost their parents. Some people lost brothers and sisters. And their needs are more direct than a lot of us. But I think, you know, the federal help is most likely here. I think from the financial side, eventually we'll be able to pull this together. But you're talking about a lot of shattered lives here. The next few days are going to be heartwarming to say the least. 
>> How has the community pulled together in the wake of this storm? 
>> Well, you have 
-- you have thousands of people wanting to help. And we're directing, you know, their attention to the red cross and asking for cash donations and any other items that they think the displaced people might need. Most people here are, you know, having to move in with friends if they've been affected or displaced and lost their housing. And, of course, you know, later this week, I think the 
-- the toughest part, when the funerals start. And we start to bury those kids that we lost in that grade school. I think that's when it's really going to hit home. I think we're 
-- in a little bit, we're processing it right now. But the toughest part is yet to come. It's going to be a long week in oklahoma city. 
[00:09:11]



>> Wow. Certainly our prayers will certainly be with you. One note, I'm sure you were glad as others were, kevin durant who's from oklahoma city has donated $1 million to the red cross. I'm sure that was a pleasant surprise amidst all this pain and problems you're facing. 
>> Yeah. Kevin really stepped up. He exceeds our expectations over and over again. 
>> Oklahoma city mayor, mick cornett. Thank you so much for your time this evening, and god bless you. 
>> Thank you, al. 
>>> Tonight, so many people around the country are talking about the teachers and students at plaza towers elementary school. There's so many heartbreaking stories and stories of courage. Some teachers literally covered the children with their own bodies. 
>> I was in a hall with some kids. It started coming down. I laid on top of them. One of my little boys just kept saying I love you, I love you, please don't die with me, please don't die with me. I never thought I was going to die. The whole time I just kept screaming to them, quit worrying, we're fine, we're fine, we're fine. 
>> I do have a student here who wants to say thank you to you. 
>> This is jamie and his mom brandy. 
>> I told you we were going to be okay. 
>> Dramatic a.P. Photos show children being pulled alive from the rubble. Rescued in those desperate moments after the tornado hit. These before and after photos show the extent of the damage. The school totally flattened. 
>> I had to wailes of, like, desks and everything. And it was pretty scary. Everybody was rushing everybody. Then I came out and I saw the cars and I saw the houses and i just started crying so hard. 
>> You are never, ever going to go through this again. 
[00:11:15]



>> We had to sit like this. And the tornado started knocking on the ceilings, go up and down. A light went down and it hit me in the head. And all the other girls were screaming. And they were crying. 
>> At nearby briarwood elementary school, emotional scenes. Teachers saving students. And parents reunited with their children. Neither school had a so-called safe room. Specifically designed to protect from this kind of weather disaster. Joining me now on the phone is chris cones, school secretary for briar elementary. Chris, what can you tell me about how the kids are doing now? 
>> Well, from the ones that i actually know I guess we're all okay. We're in shock. And shook up. And stressed. And mentally upset. But those of us that are alive, we're doing okay. And trying to pick up the pieces one little second at a time. 
>> We understand all of the students, at least that we know, have survived at briarwood. What kind of warning did you have? How much time did you have to prepare for is? 
>> Well, we, you know, had heard all day that, you know, it was a possibility. But it was about 1:30 before we started really hearing warnings from parents calling and we had our ipads on with the local news and weather. And we lost power about 30 minutes before the storm actually hit. And weren't really sure, but we definitely heard it coming. And we were allowing people in up to the last second to take cover. Parents and their animals and anybody off the street. We finally within seconds when we heard the roar, we had to take cover ourselves. All we could do was pray. We, you know, kids were screaming and crying. Adults were praying. But we never thought for a second, you know, that we weren't going to make it through it. We just 
-- we had to have faith. 
[00:13:48]



>> The children were crying and some were praying out loud, you say, which I can imagine is a scene that is unbelievable. But you say you never gave up hope you'd make it through. 
>> No. Actually, it was 
-- it was a strange thing. The roof was being, you know, ripped apart. We could hear the power of the storm. It was just like people say it was. Like a freight train coming through, but it was shredding the building. The ceiling and tiles were falling, debris on us. But when we walked out it was an odd feeling, like maybe it only happened to the school. But when we walked out, we noticed that everything was gone. And that's when the complete shock set in. That, you know, this was a truly devastating storm and we were very lucky to have come out alive. 
>> So while it was happening, this freight train sound, with you not knowing how widespread it was and how devastating it was, and then you walk out and the town you know flattened and gone, I mean, I don't know how anyone could describe how that must have felt. 
>> No, you really can't. And I live in a neighborhood blocks from here by the school. I wasn't sure if my home was still standing or not. It's a definite panicked feeling. But still are thankful that you're alive. 
>> Well, god bless all of you. It's great testimony, though, that you never gave up faith. Chris combs, school secretary for briarwood elementary. Thanks for coming on the show tonight. 
>> Thank you. 
>> God bless you and the whole community. 
>>> Ahead, it was the most powerful tornado tracked. 200-mile-per-hour winds. So how did it happen? And will it happen again? And the stories of hero teachers saving lives. They're emerging. We'll be back with our continuous coverage, next. 
[00:15:56]



>> We were all in cover. A teacher took cover of us. Miss crossway. 
>> Miss crossway actually, she threw her body right over you, didn't she? 
>> Yes. 
>> Was she covering you and some other students. 
>> She was covering me and my friend zachary. Then she 
-- I told her that we were fine because we were holding on to something. And then she went over to my friend antonio and covered him. And then 
-- so she saved our lives. ?????? ??????

>>> Have you joined the "politics nation" conversation on facebook yet? We hope you will. Everyone on your facebook page has been showing their support for the tornado victims in oklahoma. Nicole says, I am heartbroken. I donated. I wish I could do more. Sharon says, our hearts and prayers go out to everyone in moore. Especially the parents of children who lost their lives. I couldn't agree more. To learn more about recovery efforts, please head over to facebook and search "politics nation." And like us to join the conversation that keeps going long after the show ends.

>>> We had to bail out because it was coming right at us. 
>> That debris, it's 500 or 600 feet up in the air and it's going. Looks like it's roping out a little bit. Over 149th street and maybe the east side of air depot road. There it is. It's going. I don't know how to explain it, how to describe it. This is 
-- this is terrible. This is war zone terrible. 
>> That was the news as it unfolded yesterday. And today we're learning just how powerful the monster tornado was. The national weather service says it reached the ef-5 level. The highest category for tornadoes. It was on the ground for about 17 miles. With a path up to 1.3 miles wide. Winds were around 200 miles per hour. 24 people have been killed. But moore, oklahoma, has faced this kind of devastation before. A TORNADO ON MAY 3rd, 1999, Foowed a similar path. Almost also ripping through the town of moore. Its winds traveled at more than 300 miles an hour. The fastest speed ever recorded. It was one of the 74 twisters that touched down in oklahoma and kansas, killing 46 people and causing more than $1 billion in damage. So why did it happen again, and will these monstrous tornadoes become more common? Joining me now is research meteorologist dr. Harold brooks. He's with the national severe storms lab in norman, oklahoma. Thanks for joining us tonight, dr. Brooks. 
>> You're welcome. Thank you for having me. 
>> Two powerful tornadoes in the same area. Why is this happening? 
>> Well, in many senses, the fact that they occurred in the same exact location almost is a matter of bad luck. The fact that they occur in this part of the united states is really because this is the part of the planet where it's almost a perfect laboratory for making violent tornadoes. We get all the ingredients coming together more often here than any place else on earth. 
[00:23:05]



>> Bad luck notwithstanding, it happened almost the same place. Is there anything about moore, oklahoma, that would make it more of this laboratory that you were saying? 
>> Not especially. I mean, there's no real features that allow us to think that there's anything particularly special about moore. If you would have actually asked that question 20 years ago, there would be other places in the central part of the u.S. That you might have been asking the exact same question about. They've been relatively quiet since then. So it really does seem like it's just a matter of incredibly bad luck. 
>> Are these tornadoes themselves becoming more common? 
>> Not that we can tell from the records. When we try to look at the best quality records that we have, which is essential looking at the ef-1 and greater tornadoes over the last 60 years, we really don't see any long-term changes that are taking place. And when we actually examine our physical understanding and use models to understand how the environment's been changing and will they change, our expectations for how tornadoes will change as the planet continues to warm are really unclear. One of the main ingredients, the energy available for the storms, is likely to become more favorable for tornadoes. But yet another one of the ingredients, the change of the winds with height, which helps organize the storms and makes them more likely to brew tornadoes is going to decrease in the future. So we've got a balancing act and we really can't tell how it's going to play out. 
>> Now, how have things changed in terms of forecasting since 1999? 
>> Well, there have been a couple of really big things i think that have occurred. One of them is illustrated by this case very well. Back in 1999, the first time the possibility of severe thunderstorms were mentioned in the forecast was the day before or maybe the day before the day before. There was a possibility of severe thunderstorms happening in this area. In this case, actually last wednesday. So five days before the tornado occurred there were forecasts that mentioned the possibility of severe weather outbreaks in the south central plains of the united states on monday. And by friday, they were talking about the possibility of strong tornadoes occurring in this region. So we've had a 
-- we've been able to advance our ability to sort of do the long range preparatory forecasting from just two to three days up to six to seven days now. On the warning scale, the time where we start to put 
-- say this particular thunderstorm is either making a tornado or is about to make a tornado, we 
-- this was a case where all of the science we have and all of the short range numerical models that help us prepare forecasters to make the best warning decisions they can were indicating early in the morning that there was a likelihood of if a storm formed in the oklahoma city metropolitan area, that it was likely to produce a strong to violent tornado. So when that storm formed, forecasters were ready to make that kind of decision. There was no way we could have done that 15 years ago. 
[00:25:53]



>> Well, dr. Harold brooks, thank you for your time tonight. 
>> You're welcome. Have a good evening. 
>>> The search and rescue mission has turned into search and recovery. Let's go to msnbc's chris jansing live in moore, oklahoma. Chris, good evening. 
>> Reporter: Good evening to you, rev. Really, the death toll that changed so dramatically downward to 24 is explained by the chaos and the confusion and the miscounting. Now officials do believe that they have accounted for everyone that's missing. But they're not taking any chances. So the governor pledged today that these rescue teams that have been checking these buildings that have collapsed, th barely standing, they would go through them not once or twice, but three times. Already in this neighborhood, THEY'VE PUT BIG ORANGE Xs FOR The first go-round. And signs in bright green for the second go-round. We heard overnight, 101 people rescued. The influx of people not just who were volunteering but were expert in rescue came into this community and really made all the difference. And then those stories of heroism that you were talking about, we just talked to the superintendent of schools here in oklahoma. And she called teachers her angels in those two schools where where he heard about the teachers who were guarding their students. And truly saving their lives. So so many stories of heroism. And as horrible as it is here, as bad as the devastation is, a lot of people are saying the fact that so many people acted so heroically definitely saved lives, rev. 
>> Let me ask about the survivors. What are they doing tonight, the survivors whose homes have been destroyed? 
>> Reporter: Well, a lot of them are out here, actually. It wa miserable during the day. Rain was coming down heart. It was cold. More people are coming out. They're sifting through the rubble, looking for little pieces of their lives. It's not that easy to do. Not just because 
-- and you can see the bricks that are piled up and appliances and so on. 200, 210-mile-per-hour winds. Do you know how far that will carry something? Sometimes people are finding things in their yards and they're looking at them and they're saying, this might mean something to someone. Or these are photographs that i don't recognize. And you can understand how far things flew. In fact, on the medical center roof across the street from me, rev, I think it's five or six stories high, there is a car up there. We could see it with some of the helicopter shots. So that's what the folks are doing. They're going, picking up the pieces, looking for what might be left. In particular, anything that might be of sentimental value, of course. 
[00:28:36]



>> Wow. Chris jansing, thank you so much. 
>> Thank you. 
>>> Amidst so much tragedy, there are miraculous stories. A baby born just as the tornado hit town. That story is next. 
>> It was coming. It was hitting. And everybody said put your head down, put your head down! But some people got hurt, but we made it alive. 
>> We had to pull a car out of the front hallway off a teacher. And she 
-- I don't know what that lady's name is, but she had three little kids underneath her. Good job, teach. It ripped our house up. I still got a little girl buried there. I got to go. to go.

>>> Joining me now by phone is lieutenant colonel max law of the oklahoma national guard who's been out all day as part of the search and recovery mission. Lieutenant colonel moss, thanks for coming on the show tonight. 
>> Thank you for having us. 
>> What can you tell us about what you saw today? 
>> Well, much like last night, the area is 
-- is devastated. Lots of mud. Tons of debris. Broken glass. Metal. Very few structures that are still standing. It's still a dangerous situation. Even for the first responders and the law enforcement officers working the area. 
>> Tell me how the guard soldiers are responding personally to this tragedy. 
>> Well, most guard soldiers joined the national guard because they want to dend our nation. But they also want to be available to support our state in times of domestic emergencies like this one. So while it's a tough thing to do, they're honored to do it. And they're doing an outstanding job supporting the civilian agencies on the ground. 
>> Now, you've undoubtedly seen a lot of tragic situations. How does this compare in terms of the scope and the impact? How does this compare to things that you and your colleagues have had to deal with in the past? 
>> Well, it's tough. We were around the school shortly after the tornado last night. And, you know, our soldiers and airmen are professionals. They understand that the mission comes first. But they're human beings. I'm sure a lot of what they saw will stick with them for a long time. 
>> Well, we certainly thank you for your work. We're going to check back in with you. But thank you and thank all of your colleagues. God bless you all. Lieutenant colonel max moss of the oklahoma national guard. Thanks for your time this evening. 
[00:35:19]



>> Thank you, sir. 
>>> It began as a normal day at the moore medical center in oklahoma yesterday. But the massive tornado had 30 patients and staffers scrambling for their lives. They hunkered down in the cafeteria and the designated zones in the center of the hospital. The medical center looked like this yesterday morning. And like this after the monster twister's destructive path. Walls blown off. Debris blown all over. Cars piled up. And a building reduced to rubble. But out of the rubble, we're hearing about some amazing stories emerging. Not one patient or staff member was injured. Including a baby delivered just moments before impact. Joining me now is sheryl zitka. She's the hero nurse who delivered the baby and brought the baby and mother to safety. With sheryl is oklahoma state senator rob stanbridge. Sheryl, let me go to you first. I mean, this is an amazing story. 
>> Yes. It's a miracle. 
>> It is a miracle. Let me 
-- let me understand it. So you delivered the baby, and then you get a tornado alert. What happens next? 
>> Yeah. Our first alert warned us that there was a storm brewing. So we knew to prepare. So we got wheelchairs put in our patients' rooms and prepared to evacuate. Cell reception was a little spotty. So it was sometimes hard to know what was coming or where it was. Then we got the final alert that told us we needed to evacuate, go downstairs to the first floor. And so that's what we did. 
>> Where did you go next? To the first floor? 
[00:37:21]



>> Yeah. There's a cafeteria that's in the middle of our hospital on our first floor. And that is where we go when a tornado is headed our way. We had a warning the day before and had done the same thing. So we were very well prepared and knew what we needed to do to get our patients to safety. 
>> What was it like when it hit? 
>> It's unbelievable. It's hd to describe. And I'm still trying to deal with it and figure out what happened. It got 
-- it was dark. That was the first thing that kind of told us that something was happening. We could hear the hail hitting the building, even though we were on the first floor and it's a two-story floor. So we at that point got down on the floor. My patient and myself, took her baby, put him in our laps and we hugged and we started praying. 
>> The baby was in your patient's 
-- the baby was in your patient's lap, had just been born, and in your patient's lap, and you all hugged and braced yourselves with the baby when it hit? 
>> Yep. Yep. We did. Baby was a little over an hour old. Didn't even have a diaper on yet at that point. But mom and I held the baby and prayed. And made it through. 
>> The baby just an hour old. And you and the mother who had just given birth, holding and praying as this storm hits. 
>> Yes. 
>> Geez. What happens to the baby after the tornado had passed? 
>> Well, once it passed, you know, very dark. We couldn't see. Tried to start exiting the building. The front of the building had completely collapsed, so we couldn't go that way. Got my patient back in the wheelchair. Started trying to push her through the debris and had wonderful people in front of us trying to move everything out of the way. Also had another patient that had delivered earlier that morning. Her nurse is 33 weeks pregnant and with us. And pushing her patient right along with us. Guys got the debris out of the way. We made it probably halfway through the building and couldn't go any farther with the wheelchairs. There was just too much rubble and too much debris. So at that point my patient got up and walked barefoot and we got out of the building. 
[00:39:38]



>> Senator 
-- state senator standridge, with all of the rubble and all of the debris and all of people there traumatized, I mean, this is an amazing story. A baby born, and this nurse being able to bring the mother and baby through this an hour after birth. I mean, this is an amazing story, senator. 
>> Yes, it is, reverend. I'm here to, you know, support my friend and hero, sheryl stoepker. It's amazing. You see all the health care providers, first responders, jumping out here to volunteer. It's why we love our state. It's amazing to see them come to everybody's assistance. Like you said and sheryl said, the miracle of making it through that sort of destruction is just awe inspiring, to be honest. My heart grieves for those that have lost loved ones and those that are still uncertain. So as we trumpet those heroes out here, let's keep that in mind, keep those in our prayers. We sure appreciate sheryl and others in that hospital to get everybody to safety and keep everybody cared for. 
>> Yeah. Well I agree, sheryl is a hero. Sheryl and oklahoma state senator sandridge, incredible story. Thank you for sharing it with us. 
>> Thank you. 
>> Thank you. 
>>> What can you do to help? We'll have that ahead in our continuing coverage of the tornado agedy in oklahoma.

>>> the 17-mile path of destruction that this tornado left behind is devastating. But it's not surprising given the videos that have emerged of this storm. Across moore, oklahoma, storm chasers captured chilling video of the funnel as it tore through the community. 
>> Oh, my god. 
>> This is not good. Please, dear god, please keep these people safe. Lots of debris in the air.

>> Well, we started on the storm when it was a few mimes west of moore. It intensified very quickly, got very large. Came right into moore. We were, yes, a half mile south of it. It was probably a mile wide. It was debris everywhere in the air. And you can see what kind of destruction it caused. It was a 
-- it was a terrible thing to see. 
>> Now, you've been storm chasing for ten years. How does this storm compare to tornadoes that you've witnessed before? 
>> This is above and beyond anything I've ever seen. This is devastation on a level I've never experienced. This is much bigger than 
-- than anything that I've ever been near in my storm chasing career. 
>> I keep hearing people tell me tonight about it sounded like a train. Or like a freight train. What was the sound like where you were? 
>> I would characterize it as a very loud 
-- being next to a very big waterfall. Just a deafening roar. That's all you could hear, was just the roar of this tornado as it 
-- as it approached our location. It was just deafening. 
[00:46:50]



>> You know, this can be dangerous, what you do. How do you know when to leave and take cover? 
>> Well, we position ourselves in an area where we know the tornado is not dtly heading for. We got ourselves in a position where we could be less than a mile away. We were flagging people that were driving out near the funnel. We were trying to get them out of harm's way. But we have the equipment to do so and do so safely. 
>> After the storm, you helped with the search and recovery. Tell us what you saw. 
>> Well, we were chasing in a 15-passenger van. We had a large vehicle. We put out on social media that we had the space and the means to get people out of there if we needed to. We showed up to the triage unit right over here at the movie theater, and we discussed with people what we could do. We were able to transport several people out of harm's way who had lost their vehicles in the tornado. So we were able to make a difference that day. 
>> STORM CHASER chris McBee, thank you so much for your time this evening. 
>> Thanks for having me. 
>>> We'll be right back with how you can help the survivors. 
>> I still have yet to find my f-150 pickup. And I don't know where it's at. I'm going to be okay. We're going to get back. We're definitely okies. That's what we're known for. We'll come back arms a swinging. ?????? ??????

>> Well, what is the greatest lead that you're seeing on the ground right now? 
>> I think there's a lot of needs. One of the needs that americare is seeing is access to medication and medical supplies that are needed to restore health. As you can imagine, residents are displaced or injured, they need everything from tetanus vaccines so they can come and safely clean up their homes as well as medicines for individuals to have chronic care conditions like diabetes all the way down through your basic supplies like water and hygiene supplies that you would get at a drugstore. 
>> How are you working with other relief organizations that are there in moore? 
>> Americare has a vast partner network of health centers as well as voluntary partners and social service agencies. We're working with local clinics to make sure they have the medicine they need to treat disaster survivors. We're also providing two truckloads of water and more supplies to the regional food bank w is considering continuing to provide important items like water due to water shortages and also interruptions in the water system.

>> Now, people listening to you right now, what is it that you most need them to do? 
>> The best thing that you can do to help is provide a cash donation. Americare can multiply your donations many, many times over. We work with many pharmaceutical companies and other great organizations to provide products at no cost to those who need it the most. So a cash donation can be the best way that you can contribute.

I've put together a sumptuous European banquet. In the next half-hour, we'll experience "Delicious Europe": mouth-watering food, fun-loving people, and vivid culture. From tasty tapas to flaky croissants to deliciosopastas, it's hands-on travel today as Europe embraces life with gusto, inspiring us to get the most out of our lives as well. Enjoy this highly caloric first segment, and I'll see you at the break. Bon app??tit! If you set out to enjoy all of Europe's unparalleled variety of taste treats, you could be there for years. The diversity of the continent's food is truly amazing. And while the unification of Europe has homogenized some things, food is still as vividly local as ever. In fact, if lost, I bet a traveler could determine his or her location simply by what's on the menu. But a few things are the same all across Europe: meals are eaten slowly, compared to the United States; the food is best appreciated in courses; and eating is enjoyed most with family and good friends. A perfect example of this was when I had a classic Andalusian dinner with my friend and fellow tour guide, Isabel Martinez. Isabel has invited us to Bodegas Campos, a historic and venerable house of eating, for our own festival of Andalusian specialties. And here in Andalusia, no special meal starts 

[00:02:01]


without the porcine gold standard,jam??n ib??rico. This is an especially good one. Jam??n. Jam??n ib??rico. Why does it taste so good, the jam??n ib??rico? Because the pig lived outside. Okay, so he's running around. It lives in the countryside; it's free. After thejam??n ib??rico, the plates just ke on coming. This place specializes in traditional Andalusian fare -- rustic food that originated with the peasantry. There are also a few dishes that have a Moorish influence. But if there is one common denominator to all the food, it's... Olive oil, definitely. The finale, definitely for carnivores only, is pork from the Iberian black pig and -- what could be more Spanish? -- bull's tail. We've had nine different plates. Yeah, we love eating and we love sitting around the table for hours. It's living well. Yeah, that's Andalusian lifestyle. For a particularly relaxed and rustic version of living and eating well, l love the Greek island of Hydra. You'll find plenty of great places to eat, and I know one that's worth the extra hike. At the top of the town, the humble Taverna Leonidas has been around so long it doesn't need a sign. The island's oldest and most traditionaltaverna was the hangout of the local sponge divers a century ago. These days, Leonidas and Panagiota feed guests as if they're family. And tonight the place is all ours as our enthusiastic cook welcomes us into his kitchen. Yamas. Yamas. So what are we cooking? We cook lamb with roast potatoes. Grilled shrimps with a wine lemon sauce. Oh, yeah. Calamari with a garlic sauce. Very good. Spanakopita -- spinach pie. Spinach pie. Eggplant and beets. And before we know it, Leonidas has us all sitting at the table and he starts bringing in wave after wave of his fabulous dishes. Here we go, the shrimp. Here are the shrimp, grilled shrimp with lemon sauce. 

[00:04:03]



[ ?????? ]  ??????
Yamas! Yamas! I bring you the main attraction. [ laughing ] In Munich, as in much of Germany, a beer garden can be a great way to have simple but good food in a communal atmosphere. On a balmy summer evening, it's just right for a memorable dinner. Traditionally, beer rdens allow picnickers to bring in their own food as long as they buy a beer. Or you can buy specialties cooked right there. We're eating as Bavarian as possible. I've got my fish on a stick here. What do you call this in German? It's a steckerlfisch. Steckerlfisch. Steckerlfisch, fish on a stick... A nice big pretzel. Yah, brezel. A carefully carved radish. You've got what? A pork knuckle. A pork knuckle? Yes, that's a big portion of meat. And big beers. And big beers. Munchen! Cheers. Whether you bring your own food or buy it here, this is a perfectlygemutlich scene. Gemutlich is the unique word for Bavaria's special coziness, conviviality, that wonderful knack for savoring the moment. Further south, in Italy, there's such a passion for food that you often find chefs acting like tour guides. My son Andy joined us for just such a food tour at Florence's Trattoria Tito. My favorite restaurants in Europe have a common thread: they're run by people who love their work. And Bobo, with hisgrande personality, runs this place with exuberance. Tonight, we're going with his recommendation: the antipasto extravaganza. A parade of plates... with wine to match. Knowing what I'll be eating, he recommends a wine that complements the food. Dry enough to clean the mouth with salamis, with the fats of salamis. Bobo, the consummate professional, 

[00:06:05]


tests the wine to make sure. I think it's perfect. Okay, this is the pecorino cheese. We usually age it in caves for 12 months, and it's perfect to eat with the honey or with the fava beans. You have to get a fava bean. You have to break it... Break it. Push out the bean...okay? Look at that. That's nice. Eat it, and with a piece of pecorino cheese. It's perfect. Bobo takes a break from his busy schedule to make sure the wine will still complement the fava beans. What dedication! It's not a typical Florentine starter without the bruschettas, or crostini,as we call them. Ah, I think it's time to change the wine. I was just about to suggest that. I will serve you a syrah, and it will be perfect with the stronger cheeses and with the wild meats. Enjoy. I'm working. [ laughs ] Bobo certainly loves his work. Okay, this is wild salamis. Enjoy them with the wine. Oh, boy, here comes another wine change. Okay, this is the Vin Santo, and these are our homemade Florentine biscuits with almonds. So you dip them in the sweet wine for five seconds. Due, tre, quattro... Cinque. And then you eat them. My European friends seem to understand that life is good, especially when you live it fully. And we know quality programming -- 

[00:08:06]


like we enjoy here on public television -- is part of good living as well. Consider how public television inspires us to get up and embrace life, to really experience our world. That's a treasure. In my travels, I've noticed an irony. So often, people in the poor world live life boldly, with a mindset of abundance. And here in the rich world, many of us live our lives fearfully, with a mindset of scarcity. I believe supporting public television is embracing life with a spirit of abundance. And right now, that comes with some great travel gifts. STEVES: To encourage your support of this great station, we have two exciting thank-you packages: $60 and $160. Contribute $60, and we'll thank you with three gifts: the new edition of Europe Through the Back Door, my how-to-travel handbook. Updated each year for the last 30 years with three months of travel experience, it's 800 pages of practical, money-saving travel tips and the perfect recipe for anyone hoping to eat their way through Europe. Plus, you'll get our latest newsletter highlighting the best experiences in Europe and a special DVgiving you an intimate look at life on our bus tours, and our new three-part Travel Skills series. Or for $160, we'll send you those gifts plus our big 14-disc DVD anthology with 100 episodes -- everything we've ever produced. That's over 50 hours of travel fun, including our special programs like Iran and European Christmas, my money-saving travel lectures, and lots of delicious Europe. We eat well in every episode, so that's 100 lip-smacking meals from Finland to Portugal to Greece. Today we're recognizing the value of public television -- and supporting it. Make that call and make your choice: $60 for the how-to-travel guidebook so you can enjoy delicious Europe without going broke, plus the newsletter and the specialTravel Slls DVD. Or $160 for those gifts 

[00:10:06]


plus our bigAll 100 Shows DVD box set, with every show we've ever made and every delicious meal we've ever filmed. Thanks for supporting public television. Consider the drive in this country to privatize just about everything in sight. Well, I believe that it's more important than ever that we have a public, people's alternative to commercial broadcasting, and this station is it -- with a passion for programming that enriches our lives and celebrates our world. When you give at that top $160 level, you'll receive all the gifts, and that includes this DVD box set. Here's a little tease with just one minute out of the 50 hours of travel fun packed into this gift. STEVES: TheRick Steves' Europe Anthology is the definitive video library of European travel. One hundred episodes take you from the fjords of Norway to the canals of France; from the wild coast of Ireland to enchanting Estonia. You'll discover hidden Alpine villages, explore modern cities layered with history, feel the thrill of Europe's festivals, and relax on the Mediterranean. And there are bonuses you'll never see on Tv. There's the practical Europe Through the Back Door lecture I've been giving for three decades, some of my favorite scenes that didn't make it into the regular shows, and outtakes, proof that things don't always go as smoothly as it seems. Didn't understand a word he said. Okay? For any traveler or Europhile, this collection, with everything we've ever produced, that's 55 hours of video, offers a lifetime of travel learning, lessons, and fun. At $160, you get this, plus the guidebook, the newsletter, and the extra DVD with the three special Travel Skillsepisodes, which we produced especially as a thank-you for supporters of public television. Give us a call! Even if you're not in a philanthropic mood right now, this is a great deal. With all this practical information, you'll earn back your contribution within just a couple of days in Europe. 

[00:12:08]


Next up, it's time to eat some more, and we're in for some unforgettable taste treats. As you watch, consider the value of public television to open up our world, to introduce us to things we'd never know about otherwise. It helps us learn valuable lessons by getting us out of our comfort zone -- into new food, for example -- and exposing us to different, often challenging ideas. While other channels may dumb us down, public television makes us smarter. It carbonates our lives in a beautiful way. And it happens because of your enlightened and generous support. Now it's time for your second course. Enjoy. 
[ ?????? ]  ??????
One of the things that distinguishes a culture is its food. And the more characteristic and exotic dishes make for some great memories: think haggis in Scotland, or escargot in France. Eat with a spirit of adventure. You're missing out on one of the joys of travel if you don't try the stranger local specialties. Pig's ears -- I never thought I'd be eating actual pig's ears. Bold eaters discoversome amazing taste treats that the timid eaters miss. Try the steak tartare in France, schmaltz, or lard, in Austria, and skewered goat in Greece. One of the best ways to taste strange-yet-yummy food is to go to a bar that serves small plates with your drinks: tapas in Spain orcicchetti in Venice. You'll be rewarded by new discoveries and surprised at how good they taste. With a good regional wine in a rustic setting you can eat cheaply and make new friends or enjoy old ones. Alessandro is joining us to give our nibbles some meaning. So what is cicchetti? It's a small bite, you know, that you normally have when you have a glass of wine with a friend. And it can make a small meal. If you keep going for three, four bars, yes. Because you can't drive a car in Venice, it's perfectly suited to bar hopping like this. This is cicchetto, a little thing that you grab with the hand as to be finger food. 

[00:14:08]


Eat with your fingers with your wine. In your finger with your wine. You help yourself; one for you, one for me, a little for you, a little for me. And they try, you see. Look, yeah. That's a good one. Alessandro says it's all right to just point at what you want, but your selection will be limited to what's fresh from the market that day. When you come here to the bar, you have to order what they find in the market in the morning. It has to be fresh. So this is representative of what Francisco found in the market good this morning. Yes, yes, you find it in the market in the morning. Eatingcicchetti is a tasty opportunity to try something new and unusual. This one, they are cooked in the oven. You grab it from the tail. By the tail. By the tail. And you eat it just in one -- they are fantastic. Ah, they are fantastic. You see? Oh, that's an explosion of taste. But don't forget, according to Alessandro, you only eatcicchetti so you can have more of the main course: wine. In Venice, it's hard to miss its exotic taste treats from the sea. But nearly every place has its odd and memorable local specialties well worth trying. Olomouc in the Czech Republic has its notoriously stinky cheese. My friend Honza held my hand for this particular taste adventure. So we all know about the great Czech beer, but what's with this famous cheese from Moravia? Well, the Olomouc syrecky, it's the stinkiest cheese in the whole country. Really? And if there's one thing you associate with Olomouc, it's this cheese. My mom comes from this region. When I was a kid, when she would start eating this at home, me and my dad, we'd just clear out the kitchen. So the thing that makes this cheese is the way it ages. It ages under aged meat, so the meat itself has to be aged to age this cheese. And then you have to age in order to learn to like this cheese. And what are you putting on it? That's young onion -- young, strong onion. 

[00:16:09]


And why is that important? It's good for you as a man. [ laughs ] Stinks, but it's good. And what is this? These? These are really strong mints so you can go and kiss your wife when you go home. And sometimes those memorable taste experiences are drinkable. In Stockholm, for example, you can put on a heavy coat and sip a fancy vodka on ice -- literally. The Absolut Icebar is actually made out of ice. For your cover charge, you'll get 45 chilly minutes to sip your choice of vodka drinks in an ice glass... at an ice bar... or lounging on a nice ice sofa. In a scene like this, there's no shortage of conversation. Wow, those were some worthwhile calories. Thinking of all this food reminds me, we are what we eat. And in the same way, we are what we put into our brains. Consider this: The ideas and entertainment we consume by watching TV is food for our brains. It shapes who we are, both as individuals and as a society. Sure, junk media, like junk food, can be fun. But for a society to stay healthy, we need a balanced diet with quality media as well. That's where public broadcasting comes in. It offers a full array of programs: meaty documentaries, spicy foreign fare, frothy comedies, and a little soul food. It gives us a quality cultural diet -- ! intellectual nutrition that's not sugarcoated. Since the media shapes our outlook so powerfully these days, we need to be vigilant, mindful about who's in control of it. If only a handful of powerful companies control what media's available to us and to our families, we end up with fewer choices and fewer perspectives. It weakens the richness of public discourse here in America. How do we prevent that? We fund public media in our community. 

[00:18:11]


That's what this membership drive is all about. With your contribution, you can help keep public broadcasting a positive and independent force in our media environment. Don't think of this pledge drive as a drag. It's a celebration of the power of the individual to make a difference. This is your chance to help make this station strong. Our country is all about "we the people," and so is public broadcasting. If you understand that, then you know that calling right now is flat-out good citizenship. Consider these thank-you gifts and then, please, give us a call. Let's review today's exciting top thank-you package. Support your station with a contribution of $160, and you'll receive all the gifts we're talking about today: the newsletter; the special DVD with two hours of travel tips; Europe Through the Back Door, the how-to-travel guidebook; plus our excitingAll 100 Shows box set of DVDs -- that's our entire Rick Steves' Europe library. Today we're celebrating public television. And the choice is yours: $60 for the guidebook, Skills DVD and newsletter; or $160 for all the gifts, including the big DVD anthology. Thank you! As a tour guide, I love to pack each day and each DVD with as many experiences as possible. If you've enjoyed the tasty clips we've dished up so far, you'll love the 50 hours of travel fun in this box of DVDs. Nearly every show includes my favorite meal in that destination. 100 episodes -- that's 100 mouth-watering meals. I ate every one of them just for you. As a tour guide, I also like to help others learn from my experience and enjoy Europe to the max. That's why we've included for you the most practical guidebook of the 30 that I've written as a thank-you gift at both levels today. STEVES: Europe Through the Back Door -- updated with 100 days of research every year since 1980 -- is now out in its 30th edition. Throughout my European travels, I take careful notes and pack the lessons I learn into this 700-page handbook. 

[00:20:14]


My goal? That you gain from my experience so you can travel smoother and more economically. Europe Through the Back Door is packed with practical tips. All the essential travel skills are covered, from chapters on packing light and planning a smart itinerary to eating your way through Europe and finding great hotels. You'll discover how to double your cultural experience for half the price. And the book features chapters on my 40 favorite getaways, the most enchanting corners of Europe, discoveries I call "the back doors." The savings from the tips you'll learn will earn back the cost of this book on your first day in Europe. We Americans need to use both our time and our money smartly. And that's whatEurope Through the Back Door is all about. Up next is our final course, an extravaganza of good European eating that illustrates how food, family, and community can all come together. In this next segment, we also see how people around the world embrace life differently but with equal enthusiasm. As you watch, think of how public television enriches our lives by inspiring us to live every day to its fullest. Good travelers don't just sightsee. They experience the places they visit. Get sensual... find ways to really use all your senses. Wherever you go, make a point to see, hear, touch, smell, and taste. Experience each destination as a rich mix. It's the landscape and the climate. It's the history and the art. And it's the people and their culture. These are the things that make a place distinct and vivid. And the cuisine is a critical part of that exciting mix. How can you say you've traveled to Naples unless you've had a pizza there? What's a trip to the Swiss Alps without savoring fondue? In England, you're missing out 

[00:22:15]


if you don't join the locals at a pub and enjoy some hearty pub grub with your ale. And a steaming bowl of bouillabaisse gives your French Riviera experience an extra dimension. Make food as much of your travel plans as seeing museums and palaces. Try everything from the lowliest street food -- like souvlaki in Greece or fish sandwiches on Istanbul's Golden Horn -- to a gourmet splurge in France or Italy. Taste wine where it's made and drink beer where it's celebrated. Embrace the edible dimension of each culture you visit and rich memories will be yours. Wherever you travel, eat well. 
[ ?????? ]  ??????
Watching all this great eating, I was enjoying thoughts of how public television can be our window to the world and how important that is. Today, our nation is faced with complex and unprecedented challenges both at home and abroad. We need media that boldly and thoughtfully grapples with these issues. We need programming that respects our intellect, 

[00:24:17]


assumes an attention span, and is shaped not by advertisers but by a passion for bringing us a better understanding of our world. We need one place on the dial that belongs to us, to the people. Imagine: A tv station that treats us not like consumers, but like neighbors. Public television is a national treasure. It's a treasure for our families, our communities, and for our country. Please join us by calling now. STEVES: To encourage your support of this great station, we have two exciting thank-you packages: $60 and $160.

A perfect example of this was when I had a classic Andalusi dinner with my friend and fellow tour guide, Isabel Martinez. Isabel has invited us to Bodegas Campos, a historic and venerable house of eating, for our own festival of Andalusian specialties. 

[00:02:01]


And here in Andalusia, no special meal starts without the porcine gold standard,jam??n ib??rico. This is an especially good one. Jam??n. Jam??n ib??rico. Why does it taste so good, the jam??n ib??rico? Because the pig lived outside. Okay, so he's running around. It lives in the countryside; it's free. After thejam??n ib??rico, the plates just keep on coming. This place specializes in traditional Andalusian fare -- rustic food that originated with the peasantry. There are also a few dishes that have a Moorish influence. But if there is one common denominator to all the food, it's... Olive oil, definitely. The finale, definitely for carnivores only, is pork from the Iberian black pig and -- what could be more Spanish? -- bull's tail. We've had nine different plates. Yeah, we love eating and we love sitting around the table for hours. It's living well. Yeah, that's Andalusian lifestyle. For a particularly relaxed and rustic version of living and eating well, l love the Greek island of Hydra. You'll find plenty of great places to eat, and I know one that's worth the extra hike. At the top of the town, the humble Taverna Leonidas has been around so long it doesn't need a sign. The island's oldest and most traditionaltaverna was the hangout of the local sponge divers a century ago. These days, Leonidas and Panagiota feed guests as if they're family. And tonight the place is all ours as ournthusiastic cook welcomes us into his kitchen. Yamas. Yamas. So what are we cooking? We cook lamb with roast potatoes. Grilled shrimps with a wine lemon sauce. Oh, yeah. Calamari with a garlic sauce. Very good. Spanakopita -- spinach pie. Spinach pie. Eggplant and beets. And before we know it, Leonidas has us all sitting at the table and he starts bringing in wave after wave 

[00:04:01]


of his fabulous dishes. Here we go, the shrimp. Here are the shrimp, grilled shrimp with lemon sauce. 
[ ?????? ]  ??????
Yamas! Yamas! I bring you the main attraction. [ laughing ] In Munich, as in much of Germany, a beer garden can be a great way to have simple but good food in a communal atmosphere. On a balmy summer evening, it's just right for a memorable dinner. Traditionally, beer gardens allow picnickers to bring in their own food as long as they buy a beer. Or you can buy specialties cooked right there. We're eating as Bavarian as possible. I've got my fish on a stick here. What do you call this in German? It's a steckerlfisch. Steckerlfisch. Steckerlfisch, fish on a stick... A nice big pretzel. Yah, brezel. A carefully carved radish. You've got what? A pork knuckle. A pork knuckle? Yes, that's a big portion of meat. And big beers. And big beers. Munchen! Cheers. Whether you bring your own food or buy it here, this is a perfectlygemutlich scene. Gemutlich is the unique word for Bavaria's special coziness, conviviality, that wonderful knack for savoring the moment. Further south, in Italy, there's such a passion for food that you often find chefs acting like tour guides. My son Andy joined us for just such a food tour at Florence's Trattoria Tito. My favorite restaurants in Europe have a common thread: they're run by people who love their work. And Bobo, with hisgrande personality, runs this place with exuberance. Tonight, we're going with his recommendation: the antipasto extravaganza. A parade of plates... with wine to match. Knowing what I'll be eating, he recommends a wine that complements the food. 

[00:06:02]


Dry enough to clean the mouth with salamis, with the fats of salamis. Bobo, the consummate professional, tests the wine to make sure. I think it's perfect. Okay, this is the pecorino cheese. We usually age it in caves for 12 months, and it's perfect to eat with the honey or with the fava beans. You have to get a fava bean. You have to break it... Break it. Push out the bean...okay? Look at that. That's nice. Eat it, and with a piece of pecorino cheese. It's perfect. Bobo takes a break from his busy schedule to make sure the wine will still complement the fava beans. What dedication! It's not a typical Florentine starter without the bruschettas, or crostini,as we call them. Ah, I think it's time to change the wine. I was just about to suggest that. I will serve you a syrah, and it will be perfect with the stronger cheeses and with the wild meats. Enjoy. I'm working. [ laughs ] Bobo certainly loves his work. Okay, this is wild salamis. Enjoy them with the wine. Oh, boy, here comes another wine change. Okay, this is the Vin Santo, and these are our homemade Florentine biscuits with almonds. So you dip them in the sweet wine for five seconds. Due, tre, quattro... Cinque. And then you eat them. 

[00:08:02]


My European friends seem to understand that life is good, especially when you live it fully. And we know quality programming -- like we enjoy here on public television -- is part of good living as well. Consider how public televion inspires us to get up and embrace life, to really experience our world. That's a treasure. In my travels, I've noticed an irony. So often, people in the poor world live life boldly, with a mindset of abundance. And here in the rich world, many of us live our lives fearfully, with a mindset of scarcity. I believe supporting public television is embracing life with a spirit of abundance. And right now, that comes with some great travel gifts. STEVES: To encourage your support of this great station, we have two exciting thank-you packages: $60 and $160. Contribute $60, and we'll thank you with three gifts: the new edition of Europe Through the Back Door, my how-to-travel handbook. Updated each year for the last 30 years with three months of travel experience, it's 800 pages of practical, money-saving travel tips and the perfect recipe for anyone hoping to eat their way through Europe. Plus, you'll get our latest newsletter highlighting the best experiences in Europe and a special DVD giving you an intimate look at life on our bus tours, and our new three-part Travel Skills series. Or for $160, we'll send you those gifts plus our big 14-disc DVD anthology with 100 episodes -- everything we've ever produced. That's over 50 hours of travel fun, including our special programs like Iran and European Christmas, my money-saving travel lectures, and lots of delicious Europe. We eat well in every episode, so that's 100 lip-smacking meals from Finland to Portugal to Greece. Today we're recognizing the value of public television -- and supporting it. Make that call and make your choice: $60 for the how-to-travel guidebook so you can enjoy delicious Europe without going broke, 

[00:10:04]


plus the newsletter and the specialTravel Skills DVD. Or $160 for those gifts plus our bigAll 100 Shows DVD box set, with every show we've ever made and every delicious meal we've ever filmed. Thanks for supporting public television. Consider the drive in this country to privatize just about everything in sight. Well, I believe that it's more important than ever that we have a public, people's alternative to commercial broadcasting, and this station is it -- with a passion for programming that enriches our lives and celebrates our world. When you give at that top $160 level, you'll receive all the gifts, and that includes this DVD box set. Here's a little tease with just one minute out of the 50 hours of travel fun packed into this gift. STEVES: TheRick Steves' Europe Anthology is the definitive video library of European travel. One hundred episodes take you from the fjords of Norway to the canals of France; from the wild coast of Ireland to enchanting Estonia. You'll discover hidden Alpine villages, explore modern cities layered with history, feel the thrill of Europe's festivals, and relax on the Mediterranean. And there are bonuses you'll never see on Tv. There's the practical Europe Through the Back Door lecture I've been giving for three decades, some of my favorite scenes that didn't make it into the regular shows, and outtakes, proof that things don't always go as smoothly as it seems. Didn't understand a word he said. Okay? For any traveler or Europhile, this collection, with everything we've ever produced, that's 55 hours of video, offers a lifetime of travel learning, lessons, and fun. At $160, you get this, plus the guidebook, the newsletter, and the extra DVD with the three special Travel Skillsepisodes, which we produced especially as a thank-you for supporters of public television. Give us a call! Even if you're not in a philanthropic mood right now, 

[00:12:05]


this is a great deal. With all this practical information, you'll earn back your contribution within just a couple of days in Europe. Next up, it's time to eat some more, and we're in for some unforgettable taste treats. As you watch, consider the value of public television to open up our world, to introduce us to things we'd never know about otherwise. It helps us learn valuable lessons by getting us out of our comfort zone -- into new food, for example -- and exposing us to different, often challenging ideas. While other channels may dumb us down, public television makes us smarter. It carbonates our lives in a beautiful way. And it happens because of your enlightened and generous support. Now it's time for your second course. Enjoy. 
[ ?????? ]  ??????
One of the things that distinguishes a culture is its food. And the more characteristic and exotic dishes make for some great memories: think haggis in Scotland, or escargot in France. Eat with a spirit of adventure. You're missing out on one of the joys of travel if you don't try the stranger local specialties. Pig's ears -- I never thought I'd be eating actual pig's ears. Bold eaters discoversome amazing taste treats that the timid eaters miss. Try the steak tartare in France, schmaltz, or lard, in Austria, and skewered goat in Greece. One of the best ways to taste strange-yet-yummy food is to go to a bar that serves small plates with your drinks: tapas in Spain orcicchetti in Venice. You'll be rewarded by new discoveries and surprised at how good they taste. With a good regional wine in a rustic setting you can eat cheaply and make new friends or enjoy old ones. Alessandro is joining us to give our nibbles some meaning. So what is cicchetti? It's a small bite, you know, that you normally have when you have a glass of wine with a friend. And it can make a small meal. If you keep going for three, four bars, yes. Because you can't drive a car in Venice, it's perfectly suited to bar hopping like 

[00:14:05]


this. This is cicchetto, a little thing that you grab with the hand as to be finger food. Eat with your fingers with your wine. In your finger with your wine. You help yourself; one for you, one for me, a little for you, a little for me. And they try, you see. Look, yeah. That's a good one. Alessandro says it's all right to just point at what you want, but your selection will be limited to what's fresh from the market that day. When you come here to the bar, you have to order what they find in the market in the morning. It has to be fresh. So this is representative of what Francisco found in the market good this morning. Yes, yes, you find it in the market in the morning. Eatingcicchetti is a tasty opportunity to try something new and unusual. This one, they are cooked in the oven. You grab it from the tail. By the tail. By the tail. And you eat it just in one -- they are fantastic. Ah, they are fantastic. You see? Oh, that's an explosion of taste. But don't forget, according to Alessandro, you only eatcicchetti so you can have more of the main course: wine. In Venice, it's hard to miss its exotic taste treats from the sea. But nearly every place has its odd and memorable local specialties well worth trying. Olomouc in the Czech Republic has its notoriously stinky cheese. My friend Honza held my hand for this particular taste adventure. So we all know about the great Czech beer, but what's with this famous cheese from Moravia? Well, the Olomouc syrecky, it's the stinkiest cheese in the whole country. Really? And if there's one thing you associate with Olomouc, it's this cheese. My mom comes from this region. When I was a kid, when she would start eating this at home, me and my dad, we'd just clear out the kitchen. So the thing that makes this cheese is the way it ages. It ages under aged meat, so the meat itself has to be aged to age this cheese. 

[00:16:06]


And then you have to age in order to learn to like this cheese. And what are you putting on it? That's young onion -- young, strong onion. And why is that important? It's good for you as a man. [ laughs ] Stinks, but it's good. And what is this? These? These are really strong mints so you can go and kiss your wife when you go home. And sometimes those memorable taste experiences are drinkable. In Stockholm, for example, you can put on a heavy coat and sip a fancy vodka on ice -- literally. The Absolut Icebar is actually made out of ice. For your cover charge, you'll get 45 chilly minutes to sip your choice of vodka drinks in an ice glass... at an ice bar... or lounging on a nice ice sofa. In a scene like this, there's no shortage of conversation. Wow, those were some worthwhile calories. Thinking of all this food reminds me, we are what we eat. And in the same way, we are what we put into our brains. Consider this: The ideas and entertainment we consume by watching TV is food for our brains. It shapes who we are, both as individuals and as a society. Sure, junk media, like junk food, can be fun. But for a society to stay healthy, we need a balanced diet with quality media as well. That's where public broadcasting comes in. It offers a full array of programs: meaty documentaries, spicy foreign fare, frothy comedies, and a little soul food. It gives us a quality cultural diet -- intellectual nutrition that's not sugarcoated. Since the media shapes our outlook so powerfully these days, we need to be vigilant, mindful about who's in control of it. If only a handful of powerful companies control what media's available to us and to our families, we end up with fewer choices and fewer perspectives. 

[00:18:07]


It weakens the richness of public discourse here in America. How do we prevent that? We fund public media in our community. That's what this membership drive is all about. With your contribution, you can help keep public broadcasting a positive and independent force in our media environment. Don't think of this pledge dri as a drag. It's a celebration of the power of the individual to make a difference. This is your chance to help make this station strong. Our country is all about "we the people," and so is public broadcasting. If you understand that, then you know that calling right now is flat-out good citizenship. Consider these thank-you gifts and then, please, give us a call. Let's review today's exciting top thank-you package. Support your station with a contribution of $160, and you'll receive all the gifts we're talking about today: the newsletter; the special DVD with two hours of travel tips; Europe Through the Back Door, the how-to-travel guidebook; plus our excitingAll 100 Shows box set of DVDs -- that's our entire Rick Steves' Europe library. Today we're celebrating public television. And the choice is yours: $60 for the guidebook, Skills DVD and newsletter; or $160 for all the gifts, including the big DVD anthology. Thank you! As a tour guide, I love to pack each day and each DVD with as many experiences as possible. If you've enjoyed the tasty ips we've dished up so far, you'll love the 50 hours of travel fun in this box of DVDs. Nearly every show includes my favorite meal in that destination. 100 episodes -- that's 100 mouth-watering meals. I ate every one of them just for you. As a tour guide, I also like to help others learn from my experience and enjoy Europe to the max. That's why we've included for you the most practical guidebook of the 30 that I've written as a thank-you gift at both levels today. STEVES: Europe Through the Back Door -- updated with 100 days of research 

[00:20:07]


every year since 1980 -- is now out in its 30th edition. Throughout my European travels, I take careful notes and pack the lessons I learn into this 700-page handbook. My goal? That you gain from my experience so you can travel smoother and more economically. Europe Through the Back Door is packed with practical tips. All the essential travel skills are covered, from chapters on packing light and planning a smart itinerary to eating your way through Europe and finding great hotels. You'll discover how to double your cultural experience for half the price. And the book features chapters on my 40 favorite getaways, the most enchanting corners of Europe, discoveries I call "the back doors." The savings from the tips you'll learn will earn back the cost of this book on your first day in Europe. We Americans need to use both our time and our money smartly. And that's whatEurope Through the Back Door is all about. Up next is our final course, an extravaganza of good European eating that illustrates how food, family, and community can all come together. In this next segment, we also see how people around the world embrace life differently but with equal enthusiasm. As you watch, think of how public television enriches our lives by inspiring us to live every day to its fullest. Good travelers don't just sightsee. They experience the places they visit. Get sensual... find ways to really use all your senses. Wherever you go, make a point to see, hear, touch, smell, and taste. Experience each destination as a rich mix. It's the landscape and the climate. It's the history and the art. And it's the people and their culture. These are the things that make a place distinct and vivid. And the cuisine is a critical part of that exciting mix. 

[00:22:09]


How can you say you've traveled to Naples unless you've had a pizza there? What's a trip to the Swiss Alps without savoring fondue? In England, you're missing out if you don't join the locals at a pub and enjoy some hearty pub grub with your ale. And a steaming bowl of bouillabaisse gives your French Riviera experience an extra dimension. Make food as much of your travel plans as seeing museums and palaces. Try everything from the lowliest street food -- like souvlaki in Greece or fish sandwiches on Istanbul's Golden Horn -- to a gourmet splurge in France or Italy. Taste wine where it's made and drink beer where it's celebrated. Embrace the edible dimension of each culture you visit and rich memories will be yours. Wherever you travel, eat well. 
[ ?????? ]  ??????
Watching all this great eating, I was enjoying thoughts of how public television can be our window to the world and how important that is. Today, our nation is faced 

[00:24:09]


with complex and unprecedented challenges both at home and abroad. We need media that boldly and thoughtfully grapples with these issues. We need programming that respects our intellect, assumes an attention span, and is shaped not by advertisers but by a passion for bringing us a better understanding of our world. We need one place on the dial that belongs to us, to the people. Imagine: A tv station that treats us not like consumers, but like neighbors. Public television is a national treasure. It's a treasure for our families, our communities, and for our country. Please join us by calling now.

Can you make my feet magically smaller? - I guess I could, but I wouldn't want to. - Well, please do it because I really want to be part of the good birds club. - Oh, but I love your feet just the way they are. - Yeah. - Well, they need to be smaller like all the other birds. - Oh, I don't know. - Well, please. Pretty please with sugar on it? - Ok, but I think it's a mistake. - Heh heh. You're a real pal, abby. Thanks! - All right. Long-time listener, first-time caller, magically make big bird's feet smaller. - It worked! Big bird's feet are smaller! - Yes! Ha ha ha! They're wonderful! Whoa! These little feet are a little hard to balance on. - Maybe I should make them big again. - No, no, no. They're perfect. They're just exactly what I need to get into the good birds club. Thanks, abby. Whoa! - You're welcome. I guess. 
[00:08:38]


- Good luck, big bird! - I said pretty, not clean. - Ha ha ha! - Oh. Check it out. It's bigfoot. - No. That's big bird, and look. Heh heh. Whoa! My feet are smaller, so now I'm like you, and I can be a member of the good birds club. - Yay! - Yay! - Hey! Stuff it, you turkeys! - Sorry. - No one gets into the goodirds club unless I say so. - Well, do you say so? - Hmm. No! - No? Why not? My feet are smaller. - Yeah, but look at the rest of you. Look at your big eyes and your large wings, your gigantic beak. You are way too big, isn't he, fellas? - Uh, he is pretty big. - Yeah, a lot bigger than us. - Yep. It's decided. You are way too big, so you can't be included in the good birds club, right, birds? - Right. - Right. - Oh, gee. That's too bad. - So long, big goofball. - That's big bird. - Yeah, right. Heh heh heh! Ha ha ha! - Heh heh...Ha ha ha! - [Mumbling] - ?????? they won't let me in the club ?????? ?????? they say my beak's too long ?????? ?????? my wings are too gigantic ?????? ?????? and my size is all wrong ?????? ?????? if I could become shorter ?????? ?????? maybe that would be the key ?????? ?????? I'd be happy with the way I am ?????? ?????? happy to be me ?????? - so is big bird in the good birds club now? - No. They said I'm too big. - Too big? But you're just the right size. - Well, that's what I thought, I guess i was wrong, but, abby, can you make me smaller? - Smaller? But you're big bird, not small bird. - Yeah, but, abby, I really want to be in the good birds club. - Oh, big bird, no. - Please, abby. Please, abby. Please, abby. Abby, abby, please. 
[00:10:40]


- Oh. Oh, I guess I could, but I just want to say I don't think it's a good idea. - Well, you're right, abby. It's not a good idea. It's a great idea. Ha ha! Now make me smaller. - Oh, ok, ok. - He doesn't want to be big, he doesn't want to be taller, please make my friend big bird smaller. - Whoa! Did it work? - Big bird is definitely smaller! - Great! Thanks, abby! Now I can be in the good birds club. Ha ha! Oh, boy, oh, boy. - Oh, boy. I don't think this club has very good birds in it at all. - Elmo neither. - Ha ha ha! Right? - Heh heh heh. - Uh-oh. Here comes big goofball. Ha ha ha! Look. - I don't see--ohh! - That's big bird, and look at me. I'm smaller. Now I can be in the good birds club. - Hooray! - Pipe down, poultry! No one is getting into the good birds club! - Hey. Why not? I'm not big anymore. - Yeah, but you--you--uh, you're too yellow. - What? - Yeah. Your feathers, they're too yellow. We can't include you in the club because good birds don't have yellow feathers! - But--but I love my yellow feathers. - Well, I guess you'll never be a good bird. - Aw. - So long, yellow bird. Ha ha ha ! Heh heh heh! Right? Heh heh heh. Come on. It's funny. Laugh. Ha ha ha! - Ha ha ha. - Ha ha ha! Heh heh heh! - ?????? Still can't be in the club ?????? ?????? I'm one sad fellow ?????? ?????? can't be a good bird ?????? ?????? because my feathers are too yellow ?????? ?????? I'll say it once ?????? ?????? and I'll say it sadly ?????? ?????? I'm sad that I am the way I am ?????? ?????? not happy to be me ?????? 
[00:13:07]


- oh, no. Don't tell elmo. Big bird's still not in the good birds club? - No. They said my feathers are too yellow. - That's ridiculous. Your feathers are a beautiful color. - Yeah. - Yeah. Well, that's what I thought, but I guess I was wrong. - You were not wrong. Oh, your feathers are prefect. - I'm afraid not, abby. That's why I need you to change my color. - What? No! - But I have to. Otherwise the good birds won't let me in their club. - Well, maybe big bird should forget about that club! - Yeah. - But I really want to be a good bird. - You are a good bird! - Yeah. Big bird is the best. - Yeah. - No, I'm not. Otherwise I'd be in the good birds club! So just please change my color, will you? It's easy. Just wave your wand. - Oh. - See, all you do is just say, "1, 2, turn me blue." - Oh, no! - Hey! I'm not yellow. Ha ha! Now I'm going to be a good bird. Ha ha! Here I come! - Wait, big bird. This isn't right! - Yeah. Big bird, come back! - Hey. Look at me. Now I can be in the good birds club. Ha ha! - He's blue. Ha ha ha! - Oh, no. We were right, elmo! Oh, those birds aren't good birds at all! Those birds are being mean to big bird, and they're hurting his feelings! - Well, elmo and abby have to do something to help big bird! - Yeah. A grownup. We have to tell a grownup. - But--but elmo doesn't want to be a tattletale. - But it's not tattling. It's helping. Big bird is in trouble, and we need to get a grownup to help him. - You're right, abby! Let's go! - Oh, yeah! - So can I be in the good birds club now? - No. - Why not? - Uh, I don't--your voice is too funny. Yeah. - Well, then I'll change it. Abby, abby, where are you? 
[00:15:10]


- We're here, big bird. We're here. - Big bird? Big bird! What happened? - Well, I wanted to be in the good birds club, but they said wasn't good enough, so abby changed me, and now I need her to change me again. - But, big bird, you shouldn't have to. You have big, beautiful feet. You have a beautiful, big beak. You have beautiful yellow feathers. - But the good birds club think I'm not good enough. - It's true. He's not. Heh heh heh. Right, birds? Am I right? - I guess. - Maybe. - Know what, buddy? Who cares what they think? They're just bullying you. They're treating you as if you're not good enough. The question is what do you think? - Well, I kind of think I like the way i was. - So do i! - Yeah, elmo, too. Elmo loves big bird just the way he was. - But what about the good birds club? - Big bird, you know what? Forget their club. We can start our own club. - We can? - Mm-hmm. - Are you kidding me? You will never have a club as good as the good birds club, right, birds, right? Our club is awesome! Right? - I guess. - Uh, maybe. - Big bird, our club is gonna be even better. It will be a club that includes everybody, and you don't have to change in order to join. It's a club that will accept you exactly as you are. - Oh. That sounds like a nice club. - Yeah, yeah, yeah. Elmo wants to be a part of that club. - Yeah, me, too! - Great. All right. So what are we gonna call our club? - Oh, I know, I know! Let's call it I'm happy to be me club. - Hey, hey! Excellent! Let's start our club. - Yeah! - But wait, wait. First, I'd like to go back to being me again. - Absolutely. Abby, do your thing, girl. - You got it! - All right. 1 wave, 2 waves, here comes a third, change our friend back to big bird! - Whoa! - Oh, yay! - Hey, hey, hey! All right. Hey, big bird! How do you feel? - Well, I'm happy to be me! 
[00:17:12]


- Yeah! - ?????? Don't want to change my looks ?????? ?????? won't wear a wig ?????? ?????? I'm a bird that's proud of being big ?????? ?????? take a look over here ?????? ?????? and what do you see? ?????? ?????? I'm glad to be the way I am ?????? ?????? so glad to be the way I am ?????? ?????? I'm glad to be the way I am ?????? ?????? so happy to be ?????? - hey. They get to sing songs in their club. - Yeah, and no one gets yelled at or made fun of. Hey. You think we n join? - Sure. Absolutely. - Certainly everyone is welcome to be in the happy to be me club. - Yeah! - Yeah! Ha ha! Come on! - Freeze, bird brains. If you take one more step, you are out of the good birds club forever! - You don't need that club to tell you you're a good bird. - He's right. I'm a good bird just the way I am. - Me, too. So long, good birds club! - W-w-bu-- fine! I don't need you. I don't need any of you! I'll have a great club all on my own! Unh! - Man, I hope that pigeon learns how to be a good friend someday. - Now come on, everybody. Let's start the happy to be me club. - Yay! - ?????? My skin is brown ?????? - ?????? elmo's fur is red ?????? - ?????? my feathers are yellow ?????? - ?????? I'm pink from toe to head ?????? - ?????? we'll sing it loud, sing it proudly ?????? - ?????? I'm happy ?????? - ?????? ahh ?????? - ?????? elmo's happy ?????? - ?????? ahh ?????? - ?????? I'm happy ?????? - ?????? ahh ?????? ha ha! - ?????? Happy to be me ?????? - ?????? happy to be me ?????? ha ha ha! - Hi. I'm mila. - Oh, and elmo's elmo. - And we are here to tell you about the world include. - Include! - Include. - Now the word include means to let someone into a group, and right now we'd like to show you include. - Include! - Include. - But we can't. You see, these two sheep are dancing, but they aren't letting elmo dance with them. 
[00:19:16]


- No. Elmo's not included. - No. And tell me, elmo. How does it feel to not be included? - Well, miss mila, it does not feel good. It doesn't feel good at all. - I didn't think so. - In fact, elmo feels kind of sad that he's not included. - Waaaaiiit! Stop the music. - What--what's going on? - Well, we don't want elmo to feel saaad. - You don't? - Noooo. In fact, we want elmo to be haaaappy. - You do? - Yeah. That's why we want him to join us. - Yeah. - So you want to include elmo? - Yes! Come join us, elmo! - Oh, boy! Elmo's included, elmo's included! - Musiiiic! - Well, there you have it. The word include means to let someone in the group, and the sheep just included elmo. - Stop the music! Stop the music! - What--what's going on now, guys? - We want to include someone else. - Ahh. - Who? - You! - Oh! Me? - Mm-hmm. - Musiiiic! [Music playing] - include! - Yay! Ha ha ha! - Every day on the playground, johnny and jamie wouldn't let me play with them or their friends. "You're not cool enough," they'd say. Being left out all the time made me feel sad and lonely. "That's not ok the way those guys are treating you," said kate. "You need to tell a grownup." "But I don't want to be a tattletale." "When you're having problems and need help, going to a grownup isn't tattling," she said. "It's reporting." So I went to our teacher mr. Kramer. "You did the right thing by coming to me," he said. From that day forward, mr. Kramer made sure everyone got a chance to play, and I finally got show off my sweet soccer skills. That felt pretty good.

- Abby's flying fairy school is almost here, but right now, let's figure out the letter of the day!

- hey, nithan. What's up next? - Abby's flying fairy school. - Boo-yah! [Horn honks] - ?????? look up high in the sky ?????? ?????? it's a school, it can fly ?????? - ?????? let's all hurry to the flying fairy school ?????? ?????? grab your wands ?????? - yee-ha! - ?????? Bring your wings ?????? - yeah! - ?????? We will learn magic things ?????? - ?????? let's all hurry to the flying fairy school ?????? ?????? how to make us grow ?????? ?????? and how to make us shrink ?????? - whoa! - ?????? How to solve a problem with a simple twinkle think ?????? ?????? the school is really magic ?????? ?????? and magic's really cool ?????? ?????? let's go in, let's begin ?????? ?????? it's flying fairy school ?????? - ha ha ha! - Ha ha! Ahh. [Sputtering] - whoa! Hello. Welcome to flying fairy school! We're right in the middle of music class, so sit back, relax, and listen to the sweet sounds of music. [Playing poorly] - eep eep! [Sighs] - niblet's right. We sound terrible. - Can't we just use magic to play music, mrs. Sparklenose? - Sorry, abby. No magic. The only way to play an instrument well is practice, practice, practice. - Who nes practice? I am a pro! Whooooa! Maybe you're not supposed to play it with your buttocks. - Don't give up, fairies. I'll practice with you. Where's my glockenspiel? - Mrs. Sparklenose is right. We just need practice. [Blaaat] oh. Who am I kidding? We do need magic. 
[00:25:56]


[Music playing] - tired of practicing day after day? - Yes! - Want to make music the magical way? - Yes, yes! - Then what are you waiting for? Just press play. - Ok. - Whoa! - Who are you? - I'm morty the muse, and I say hello with a do-re, a mi-fa, and a sol-la-ti-do. - Ohh! Morty the musical muse of music, what are you doing here? - What can I say? They pressed play. - Yeah. We're gonna learn music the easy way. - Oh, that's what you think, dear. They're all yours, morty! - Now here are the rules of how it must be. I can't leave till you finish my challenges 3. - I'm ready for the first challenge, sir. - With a tip of a my hat and a wave of my stick, it's time to face the fairy music. ???????????? - aah! - Abby, you got to stop that horn. - Right! Hyah! Whoa! What do I do now? - Morty's challenges always involve playing music, abby. Try playing it. - [Inhales] [plays note] [plays higher note] oh! It's not working! Every time I play, I go higher. - If you want to succeed and not hit a glitch, what you need to do is chan the pitch. - This is music, not baseball. - No. Wait. I think pitch has something to do with music. - That's right, gonnigan. In music, pitch means how high or low the sound of the musical note is. 
[00:27:58]


- High and low. Must be a clue. I'd better twinkle think. Twinkle think, twinkle think. Ok. When I play a high note, I go high, so what should I play to get low? Oh! Maybe a low note. I'll try! [Plays low note] - it's working! [Plays lower note] - ?????? how low can you go? ?????? [plays lower note] yay! - Pitch perfect, abby. - Wow! I never knew I could make so many different sounds with a trombone. - You did it. You beat it! Challenge 1 is through. Now it's time to face challenge 2! - Oh, I can't. - Of course you can, gonnigan. Gonnigan? Where's gonnigan? - He's gone again. - Flying away doesn't matter a tick. You still have to face the fairy music. Aah! My maracas are quaking! - Your maracas aren't the only thing quaking. Whoa! You better stop those maracas. - I'm trying, but I can't. They just keep shaking. I need a clue. - If you want them to stop and not to go, sounds like you need to change the tempo. - Tempo? Is that one of those fancy music words? - It sure is, blogg. Tempo is the speed of the music. - Speed of music. I'd better twinkle think. Right now everything is moving fast. What's the opposite of fast? Slow! Twinkle think, twinkle think. So if I want everything to slow down and stop, maybe i have to shake the maracas slowly, slower, slower. - Ahh. It's working. Everything's getting slower. 
[00:29:59]


- Slower...And...Stop. - Aah! You did it! - You are like a tempo pro. - Huh. I had no idea I could shake the maracas at so many different speeds. - Don't celebrate yet. No shouting, "yippee," for now it's time for challenge number 3. - Let it begiiiin! - You're ready, you say, for a little drumstick? Then it's time to face the fairy music. - Oh, I so got this. - Don't you want a clue? - Uh-uh. I'm better when I'm clueless. Hyah! Maybe I'll take the clue. Ow! Ow! Ow! - To stop the drum, there are no tricks. What you need is a change... In the dynamics! - Dynamics must be another music word. - It is. Dynamics means how loud or soft you play. - Ow! Does this mean I need to twinkle think? - Couldn't hurt. - At least not as much as this drum. Ok. How do I stop the drum with dynamics? Twinkle think, twinkle think. Ok. The drum is playing loudly. What's the opposite of loud? Soft. That's it! I have to play softly. Come on, king conga! Time to change this dynamic. Hyah! - You have to play softer, blogg, remember? - Oh, right. Softer. Softer. - It's working! - Softer...and stop. - You did it! Great job, blogg! 
[00:32:01]


- I didn't even know you could play a drum softly. - You faced my 3 challenges. You did it so quick, and now you know more about music, but alas and alack, morty's muse work is done, so, someone, please hit the rewind button. - My pleasure. - Ta-ta! [Music playing] - all right, class. It's snack time. - Aw. We learned so many new things to do with our instruments. Can't we practice a little more, please? - Absolutely. 1, 2, 3, 4! [Playing poorly] ahh. Music to my years. Eep. - Bert and ernie's great adventures are coming soon, but first, we're gonna talk about... How many is 9? 1...2... 3...4... 5...6... 7...8... 9! 9 bouquets of flowers! How many book bags do you have? 9 tap dancers! Can you count to 9? 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9! - I love the number 9! Come on. Let's check out more about the number 9. - Hello, there. The name's smidgeon. Well... ??????

My favorite kind of traveling ?????? - hyah! ?????? We're adventuring ?????? ?????? come along with bert and ernie ?????? ?????? we're gonna take a little journey ?????? ?????? bert and ernie's great adventures ?????? - the bird games. Isn't this exciting, bernice? [Coos] - [humming] - ernie, what are you doing in a duck suit? You're not a bird. - Oh, I know that, bert, but I'm rubber duckie's coach. [Coo] what's with bernice? - I think she's a little nervous about competing. It's her first time. - Well, then, maybe you should dress up as a pigeon, bert. Cheer her on like I'm cheering rubber duckie. Ra ra ra, sis-boom-ba! You know. [Whistle blows] - our first event is the squawking competition. - Better get going. Good luck, bernice. 
[00:36:03]


[Coo] - dress up as a pigeon? Now that's really absurd, isn't it? [Cooing] - bert? - I know. I look ridiculous, but anything to help my bernice. Oh, nonsense. You'll be great at this. - Ok. Birds, ready, set... [Blows whistle] squawk! And they're off. Look at that turkey puff up. Can he gobble for the gold? [Gobble] that was an interesting effort. - Me on, bernice. Coo. [Cooing] - psst. Bernice, rubber duckie thinks you might want to put a little more oomph into it like this. [Squeaking] - listen to that duckie squeak. Now that is a squeak you can dance to, and the winner is the rubber duck. - What do you know, rubber duckie? You won! Heh heh heh! - Oh. Don't be frustrated, bernice. You'll do great in the next one. - Our next event is speed pecking. The first bird to finish their bowl of bird seed will be the speed peck winner. - This is your event, bernice! You're a natural bird seed pecker. - Birds, ready, set... [Blows whistle] peck! And they're off. The rubber duck doesn't seem very hungry, but what about that pigeon? [Gobbling] whoa! Look at that turkey go. And the winner is the turkey! [Gobble] [coo] - maybe pecking just isn't your event, bernice. [Blows whistle] - now for the--awk--final event, fancy flying. - Hey. You're a great flyer. Come on. [Gobbling] 
[00:38:04]


[squeak] - what's that, rubber duckie? You want to sit this one out? Ok. Good luck, bernice. - All birds, ready, set, fancy fly! And the turkey's off. He's flying, he's flying. He's not flying. But wait. What's this? She has laid an egg. - Come on, bernice. Like this. Flap, flap. Aah! Whoa! Oh! - Wow! The little--awk--pigeon has saved the big one. Now that's what I call flying. - Keep going, bernice. Show them your stuff! - Go, bernice, go! Heh heh heh! [Cooing] - the crowd's got wild! She's flying backwards. She's going for a loop-the-loop. What's this? The pigeon dance in midair? No doubt about it. Our winner is the little pigeon bernice. - Yay! - Yay! Heh heh heh! - All she needed was a little confidence. - Good job, bird olympians. You're all--awk-- winners today. [Cooing] - you were a great coach, bert, not to mention a very fine pigeon. Heh heh heh! - Aw. Ah ah ah! [Gobble] [squeak] - good night, bert. - Good night, ernie. Uh-oh. - [Snoring] - elmo's up soon, but right now it's time to play murray's cubbies, the game where you figure out what goes in my cubbies. Let's show them what's in our cubbies. - !Si! - We have an empty cubby, a football helmet, a baseball, and a baseball helmet. What goes in my cubbies? Is it the globe, the football, or the sunglasses? Right! It's the football because it goes with the football helmet and the baseball goes with the baseball helmet! Great job! Now stay tuned! Elmo's up next!

This is lots of fun! - Not for me it isn't. I'll see you later. - Well, abby's just saying that because elmo's so much better at hot potato than she is! Right, telly? - What have I done? - Huh? - When I taught you how to win at this game, I never thought it would turn out like this. I've created a monster! - Elmo's already a monster. - I've created a monster monster! - Well, maybe telly's just upset because elmo's the best hot potato player in the universe, boyyyy! - You know what, elmo? You may be good at this game, but you don't have the eye of the potato at all. No. - Well, what does that even mean? What's wrong with everybody today? Elmo will just play with someone else. Who wants to take on the champion? 
[00:10:30]


- Hey. What are you the champion of, elmo? - Well, leela, elmo is the hot potato champion of the wor-wor-world! - Wow! Of the whole world? - Well, elmo beat abby, so probably elmo can beat everybody. - Ah. Abby is very good at that game. - Yeah, but she doesn't want to play with elmo anymore. - No? - Does leela want to play, want to play with a champion? - Sure. We can play hot potato. - Cool. Wait a minute. You have a potato? - Oh, I love this game. - Well, let's just do this thing then, boyyyy! - You're on, boyyyy! - ??????

Boyyyy! - You are very good at this game. - Good? Well, elmo's the best, elmo's the greatest, elmo's the hot potato champion of the world! Elmo just doesn't understand why abby wouldn't want to play with someone as awesome as elmo. - Um, I think I might have an idea. - Hmm? Really? - Yeah. Well, elmo, sometimes kids your age get really excited about winning. - Well, yeah. Winning is the best, baby! - Yeah, winning does feel good, but-- - yeah, baby! Ha ha ha! - Sometimes that feeling could get out of control and hurt people's feelings. - Uh-oh, leela. Elmo thinks he may have hurt abby's feelings. - Oh, yeah? - Well, elmo was so excited about winning, he didn't even think about how abby would feel. - Hmm. - But that's just because elmo really, really wanted to win. - Well, yeah. Everybody likes to win, but the trick is to be a good sport about it. - What's a good sport? - Well, a good sport is someone who when they win is nice about it and doesn't boast or show off. 
[00:12:37]


- Uh-oh. Elmo wasn't a good sport when we won. - And a good sport is someone who doesn't get too upset when they lose. - Uh-oh again! Elmo wasn't a good sport when he lost either. Boy. No wonder abby didn't want to play anymore. Elmo wasn't a good sport at all. - Hey. It is not too late. You can try being a good sport now. - We, leela, elmo wants to be a good sport. Elmo just hopes abby will forgive him. - Oh, abby's a good friend, and good friends, they understand. You'll see. - Thanks, leela. - You're welcome. I have to take this laundry over to gordon and susan, but I will see you later. - Ok. Bye, leela. Boy, elmo really wasn't being a good sport, but elmo didn't mean to act that way. ?????? Elmo thought that winning was everything ?????? ?????? elmo thought it would be fun ?????? ?????? but when all you care about is winning ?????? ?????? it's not fun for everyone ?????? ?????? elmo didn't mean to ?????? ?????? didn't mean to be like that ?????? ?????? he was kind of mean, too ?????? ?????? wishes he could take it back ?????? ?????? elmo didn't mean to ?????? ?????? they say it doesn't matter if you win or lose ?????? ?????? it's how you play the game ?????? ?????? but someone didn't play too nice ?????? ?????? elmo is his name ?????? ?????? elmo didn't mean to ?????? ?????? wishes he could start again ?????? ?????? elmo didn't mean to ?????? ?????? he wants to be a better friend ?????? ?????? elmo didn't mean to ?????? ?????? now he knows what he has to do ??????

Able to do 15 fairy flips on the head of a hatpin! It's super fairy! - Yay! Blogg, gonnigan, you've got to come and watch super fairy's new adventure! - Sorry, abby. We're busy building our giant tower. - Yeah, and whoever heard of schmoopy fairy? - Not schmoopy fairy, super fairy! I can't believe you've never heard of her or seen her super fairy cape... And super fairy helmet! Whoo-hoo! And super fairy toe warmers. Ha ha ha! - Aw, we have no time for toe warmers. 
[00:25:14]


- But-- - and no butt warmers either! - Blogg! - D'oops! I apologize on behalf of my tushie. - Ohh. Now we've got less than 6 minutes to build the world's tallest block tower. - Oh. I wish they'd come and watch for just one minute. I know when they see sup fairy they'll love her like I do. Ahh. Wait. I got it! If they won't come and watch super fairy, I'll bring super fairy to them. Whoo-hoo! Uh, spatula, ladle, ice cream scooper! Bring me the fairy that's really super! Super fairy. Ohh! - Where am i, and who are you? - This is flying fairy school, and I'm abby, your number one fan. - That's impossible. I'm my number one fan. You can be number two. So I'll give you my autograph, and off i go. There. Lovely picture of me, don't you think? And now ta-ta! Oh. Hold on! Before I go, I'm sure those two will want my autograph, also. - Uh, I don't think so, super fairy. They've never even heard of you. - What?! That's impossible! Everybody's heard of super fairy! I'm kind of a big deal, you know? - Don't worry. I'll make them fans in no time. Yoo-hoo! Look at me! Look at me! They didn't even glance at me. I have never been so ignored in my amazingly super life! - Well, they just don't like you like I do. - How can they not like me? Everyone is supposed to like super fairy. This is terrible. What am I going to do? How do I get them to like me? 
[00:27:17]


- I'm not sure. - Well, why do you like me? - Well, I like you because you're superfast! - You're right! I'm the fastest fairy in the world! That's how I'll get them to like me! Yoo-hoo! Look at me, look at me! Don't you like how fast I am? - Oh, no! - Ouch! - Do they like me now? - Ooh! Your flying messed up our tower, lady. - Uh, I don't think so. - How is that possible? Don't they realize I'm... - Super fairy! Oh, my goodness! I can't believe you're here! Don't move! I am your biggest fan. - Actually, I'm my biggest fan. You can be my littlest. - Uh, ok. - Now tell me, tiny fan, why do you like me? - Well, um, I love that you're so superstrong! Ha ha ha! - Yes. I am the strongest fairy in the universe. Aha! That's how I'll get them to like me! [Rumbling] - oh, no! Our tower! - What's going on now? - Look at me! Look at me! Do you like how strong I am? - Oh, no. - Do they like me now? - You knocked down our tower again. - I don't know what you're trying to prove, lady, but whatever it is, please stop. - Um, I still don't think they like you. - I don't get it. What is it with them? They don't like any of the superimpressive things I do. Oh, ok. I give up. I can't believe I'm saying this, but I may just have to face that some fairies and trolls will never like me, so I'm sending myself back. 
[00:29:21]


- No. Wait, super fairy. Maybe there's still some other way to get blogg and gonnigan to know and like you. - But I've tried everything I know. What else could I possibly do? - I think we need to twinkle think. - Let's not just twinkle think. Let's supertwinkle think! - Oh, yeah! Now let's see what is the best way to get somebody to like you? - Supertwinkle think, supertwinkle think. - Oh! I got it! When I want someone to like me, I just go up to em and say, "hello." - Doesn't sound very super, but I'll give it a try. Hello, there! I'm super fairy. - Aah! Our tower! - Nice way to say hello, lady. - ?????? It's not working, abby ?????? - then let's supertwinkle think again. What's the best way to get someone to like you? - Supertwinkle think, supertwinkle think. - Aha! Ask a question! - Question? What kind of question? - Oh, I know. When I want to make a new friend, sometimes i ask them what they're doing. - Super idea! Excuse me, fellas. What are you doing? - We're trying to build the world's tallest toy block tower. - And you've already knocked it down 3 times. - I think that worked a little. At least they talked to me. Come on. What do I do now? I need more help. - Help! That's it! - What do you mean? - Maybe you can help them rebuild their tower. - You think? - Why not? - Oh, give it a whirl. - Ok! Excuse me, fellas. Can I help? - I don't know. Can you? - Why, yes. You know, fellas, I think the reason your tower keeps falling is because you need to make the base wider. 
[00:31:25]


- Huh? - Let me help. - Oww! We have the world's tallest block tower! - And you did it before choice time ended. - Thanks to super fairy! - She's cool! - Come here, you two. Mmm. - Ow! - Ow! - Oops.

[00:35:39]


- the bird games. Isn't this exciting, bernice? [Coos] - [humming] - ernie, what are you doing in a duck suit? You're not a bird. - Oh, I know that, bert, but I'm rubber duckie's coach. [Coo] what's with bernice? - I think she's a little nervous about competing. It's her first time. - Well, then, maybe you should dress up as a pigeon, bert. Cheer her on like I'm cheering rubber duckie. Ra ra ra, sis-boom-ba! You know. [Whistle blows] - our first event is the squawking competition. - Better get going. Good luck, bernice. [Coo] - dress up as a pigeon? Now that's really absurd, isn't it? [Cooing] - bert? - I know. I look ridiculous, but anything to help my bernice. Oh, nonsense. You'll be great at this. - Ok. Birds, ready, set... [Blows whistle] squawk! And they're off. Look at that turkey puff up. Can he gobble for the gold? [Gobble] that was an interesting effort. - Come on, bernice. Coo. [Cooing] - psst. Bernice, rubber duckie thinks you might want to put a little more oomph into it like this. [Squeaking] - listen to that duckie squeak. Now that is a squeak you can dance to, and the winner is the rubber duck. - What do you know, rubber duckie? You won! Heh heh heh! - Oh. Don't be frustrated, bernice. You'll do great in the next one. - Our next event is speed pecking. The first bird to finish their bowl of bird seed will be the speed peck winner. - This is your event, bernice! You're a natural bird seed pecker. - Birds, ready, set... [Blows whistle] peck! And they're off. The rubber duck doesn't seem very hungry, but what about that pigeon? 
[00:37:44]


[Gobbling] whoa! Look at that turkey go. And the winner is the turkey! [Gobble] [coo] - maybe pecking just isn't your event, bernice. [Blows whistle] - now for the--awk--final event, fancy flying. - Hey. You're a great flyer. Come on. [Gobbling] [squeak] - what's that, rubber duckie? You want to sit this one out? Ok. Good luck, bernice. - All birds, ready, set, fancy fly! And the turkey's off. He's flying, he's flying. He's not flying. But wait. What's this? She has laid an egg. - Come on, bernice. Like this. Flap, flap. Aah! Whoa! Oh! - Wow! The little--awk--pigeon has saved the big one. Now that's what I call flying. - Keep going, bernice. Show them your stuff! - Go, bernice, go! Heh heh heh! [Cooing] - the crowd's got wild! She's flying backwards. She's going for a loop-the-loop. What's this? The pigeon dance in midair? No doubt about it. Our winner is the little pigeon bernice. - Yay! - Yay! Heh heh heh! - All she needed was a little confidence. - Good job, bird olympians. You're all--awk-- winners today. [Cooing] - you were a great coach, bert, not to mention a very fine pigeon. Heh heh heh! - Aw. Ah ah ah! [Gobble] [squeak] 
[00:39:49]


- good night, bert. - Good night, ernie. Uh-oh. - [Snoring] - elmo's up soon, but right now it's time to play murray's cubbies, the game where you figure out what goes in my cubbies. Let's show them what's in our cubbies. - !Si! - We have an empty cubby, a football helmet, a baseball, and a baseball helmet. What goes in my cubbies? Is it the globe, the football, or the sunglasses? Right! It's the football because it goes with the football helmet and the baseball goes with the baseball helmet! Great job! Now stay tuned! Elmo's up soon! - I hope I'm not late. Oh, good. Nobody in front of me. Oh, no! - Oh. Well, good morning, sir, and welcome to the coffee plant, home of the freshest cup of coffee in the world! - Ehh. Fine. Swell. 1 cup of coffee to go. 1 cup of coffee coming right up, sir. Ok. Here we go. - What's that? - This is a coffee bush, sir. - A coffee bush. What are you doing with a coffee bush? - Well, this bush, sir, is where coffee comes from. You see, coffee beans grow on coffee bushes, sir, and by allowing you to pick your own beans from this bush, we assure you the freshest cup of coffee in the world! - I don't want to pick my own beans. I just want a cup of coffee. - Well, then with your permission, sir, i shall do the picking for you because I know how picky you are. Ok. Let us see where we have the beans here. Oh. There's some ones in front here. Ah. No. They're not ripe yet. Ah, ooh! There's--back here, there's a nice one. Oh. Look at this little beauty hiding in the back. - Oh. Would you just pick the beans and make me a cup of coffee. - Oh. Yes, of course, sir. Get this out of the way. Of course. Now we will just place these freshly picked coffee beans in the coffee maker, and you will have your coffee tout de suite. 
[00:41:55]


- Oh, I'm gonna be late. I know I'm gonna be late. - [Humming] there you go. [Machine chugging] - now what's happening? - Oh. Our coffee plant patented coffee maker is now preparing the beans to be made into coffee! - Well, can you hurry it up. I just want my coffee. - Oh, but of course, sir. - Oh, no. Now what? - Oh. Well, our superdeluxe coffee maker is now running steaming hot water through the ground-up beans and-- [ding] voila! You now have the freshest cup of coffee in the world! - Finally. Now please just put the coffee in a bag and let me get out of here. - All rightie, sir. Here is your coffee. Perhaps you would like some sugar with that. - Uh, yeah, fine, great. Yes. Give me sugar. - Sugar coming up. [Grunting] - that isn't sugar! - Well, how observant of you, sir. Yes. That is not sugar. This is sugarcane. This is where sugar comes from. - Sugarcane? This is ridiculous! - Sir, does not the freshest cup of coffee deserve the freshest sugar? - Ohh. How long is this gonna take? - Oh, not long at all. I just need to mash the sugarcane stalks into a thick paste. Then I will separate the liquid out of the paste, heat it up into a syrup, and finally, I will spin it around really fast until all that is left is the freshest sugar in the world! - Ohh. You know what? Skip the sugar. Just give me milk and give me some coffee. - Milk! Right away, sir! That's it. Come on. That's a girl. Come right in. That's it. - A cow?! - Well, you do know that milk comes from cows, do you not? 
[00:43:58]


- Of course. - Well, the freshest cup of coffee in the world deserves the freshest milk, sir. Excuse me. Just a moment. - Oh, I don't know why every place that i go... - Do not worry. I'm a professional here. - It doesn't matter where, but this guy is there. - Attagirl. - Oh. Look this is too much. Can you just give me my coffee? I'm late enough already. - Just a few more drops, sir. - Ern. - All rightie. There you are, sir. - Well, it's about time. - Mm-hmm. Now we will just put-- wait a minute. This is odd. - What? - Your coffee has disappeared. - What?! After I waited all this time?! What happened to my coffee? Where did it go? - Mooooooooo! - I think the cow drank it. Ahh. And caffeine really makes her excitable. - Mooooooooo! - Huh? Whoa! Help! - Oh, of course, sir. I will help you. I will get you a new cup of coffee right away. Now where are those little beans? Oh, over here. - Stop this cow! Whoa! - Mooooooooo! - Ah. Whoa! - Mooooooooo! - Guess what's coming up next! - "Elmo the musical"! ??????

The world is spinning and I want to know why I got a lot of questions and big ideas I'm sid the science kid ?????? ladies and gentlemen, please give it up for me! [Applause] ha. Here I am. Hello, I'm sid. And welcome to my--hmm--welcome to my room. Ungh. Ah. Hey, i have a big problem. Ok, it all started when I asked mom for the new turbo robot mega ship. It's the coolest toy ever. 
[00:02:21]


[Sid chuckles] so, mom said I could earn the new toy by helping around the house and doing chores and stuff. And that's where the chart came in. Every time I do a chore, like put the newspapers in the recycling box, I get a rocket ship sticker. Now, if I fill up these boxes all the way across with stickers, I get the new turbo robot mega ship. [Sid chuckles] but here's the problem. I need a lot more stickers on my chart. Oh. I don't think I'll ever get the new turbo robot mega ship. I wish I could just remember all the chores I do. I just got to know--why do we need-- charts! [Echoes] 
>> sid, breakfast time. 
>> Ooh, breakfast. Ha, ha, ha. Hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo! Breakfast time! 
>> Good morning, sid. 
>> Good morning, sid. 
>> Hi, mom. Hi, dad. Hey, zekey. 
>> Yeah-- 
>> oh, almost got you. Ha, ha. 
>> So, I have a question. Do i need a chore chart? Can't i just remember that I did lots of chores, and then get the new turbo robot mega ship? 
>> Well, that's one of the great things about charts. They help us remember things. 
>> Well, you know, sid, charts can be fun. I just love weather charts. 
>> Uh--weather chart? 
>> Yeah. 
>> Da-da-da-oh! 
>> Oh! Alice, why don't you show sid the weather chart on your computer? 
>> Oh, sure. I'll find one on my favorite website. 
>> Cool. Mom is really smart with computer stuff. 
>> Uh-huh. Yeah, see? These pictures on the weather chart show you what the weather's going to be for the next 5 days. 
[00:04:21]



>> Cool. 
>> It's sunny today, cloudy for a couple days, then rain, then the sun comes back out. Ooh, it's going to be warm this weekend. That'll be nice. 
>> Yeah. 
>> Ah, sunny-- 
>> blah! 
>> Oh! Zeke? 
>> Huh? 
>> Well, looks like there's going to be a change in that weather. Turns out there's a very good chance of orange mushy baby food today. [All laugh] 
>> that's pretty funny, dad. [Pre-recorded laughter plays] 
>> all right, sid. Let's get you some breakfast. It's almost time for school. 
>> Almost time for school? Yes! Ha, ha! 
>> ?????? I love my mom 
>> uh-huh 
>> my mom is cool 
>> uh-huh 
>> but now it's time for having fun at school yeah! ?????? [sid's mother laughs] [rap beat plays] ?????? I'm looking for my friends I'm looking for you there's gabriela 
>> watch what I can do yeah, now, whoo! Yeah, now, whoo! Oh, yeah! 
>> Wow! I'm looking for my friends I'm looking for you hey, there's gerald 
>> yeah! Check out my moves I'm a rock star 
>> cool! I'm looking for my friends I'm looking for you hey, there's may 
>> may I show you how I groove? Da, da-da, da [may giggles] hey! 
>> Groovy! 
>> We're looking for our friends we're looking for you hey, there's sid 
>> did you hear the one about the kid who wanted to know everything about everything? 
>> That's you! 
>> It's about me 
[00:06:25]



>> we're looking for our friends and look what we found we found eh other friends! ?????? [all laugh] 
>> and now it's time for the sid survey. Hello. I am sid, roving reporter, with today's survey. The question--have you ever seen a chart? I bet you've seen one. Let's go get some answers. Hello, gabriela. 
>> Hello. 
>> Whoa! Hi, gabriela. Hey, listen, I'm conducting a survey. Have you ever seen a chart? 
>> Hmm, a chart? Uh--oh, there's a growth chart at my doctor's office. She measures me every time I visit, and writes down how tall I am on the chart. 
>> Wow, cool chart. 
>> Thank you. 
>> You're welcome. Oh, hi there, may. 
>> Hi. 
>> Have you ever seen a chart? 
>> Oh, yes. I have a chart in my room, of the different kinds of dinosaurs, and what they ate. 
>> Wow, dinosaurs? 
>> Yeah. 
>> Huh. Tell me more. 
>> Well, did you know that big apatosaurus ate tiny little leaves? 
>> No, I didn't, but thanks for telling me. 
>> You're welcome. Huh? 
>> May is really smart. [Gabriela whistles] ooh. Hey, gerald, how about you, sir? Have you ever seen a chart? 
>> Why, yes, yes, of course i have a seen a cart. 
>> Um--no, no, not a cart. A chart. 
>> Indeed, indeed, but you see, I have seen a grocery cart with a chart. 
>> Ah. 
>> You see, it has all the pictures of the food on it. And then it shows you where to find that food in the store. 
>> Ah, yes. Ok, I understand. Thank you, gerald. 
>> Indeed, good sir, indeed. [Whistling continues] 
>> and now, the results of my survey about charts. Which is on a chart. Hmm. Gabriela's doctor uses a chart to see how tall she's grown. May has a dinosaur chart that tells her what dinosaurs eat. And gerald saw a chart on a cart that showed where all the food was in a store. Ha, ha, ha. And i bet you've seen a chart, too. So, there you have it. I am sid, roving reporter and chart expert. 
[00:08:53]



>> Everybody, rug time! 
>> Ooh, that's teacher susie! Ha, ha. 
>> ?????? It's rug time come on in rug time take a seat rug time 
>> we're ready! 
>> Everybody, move your feet rug time 
>> teacher susie! 
>> Good times on the way rug time come on in we've got a lot to learn today ?????? ok, sneaky gerald, come on over. [Rap beat continues] 
>> he gets it. Ha! Yeah! [Gerald chuckles] 
>> oh! [Laughter] 
>> agent gerald strikes again! 
>> Huh? [Laughter] 
>> ok, gerald. So, how's everyone doing today? 
>> Well, we were all talking about charts. I didn't realize so many people use charts. 
>> No, me, either. 
>> Yeah, I wonder how you make one. 
>> Yeah. Well, I'm feeling like I don't like my chore chart. 
>> Oh, no. Why not, sid? 
>> Well, because I still don't get why we need all these charts. 
>> Oh. Well, charts are very helpful scientific tools. In fact, all scientists use charts almost every day. And u can learn how to use them, too. 
>> Yeah? 
>> Yeah. In school, we like to count things. We count how many people are in school today, and I write it here on this chart. Let's see. Is sid here today? 
>> What? Oh. Here. [Laughter] that's a good one, susie. 
>> Thanks. Gabriela? 
>> Here. 
>> May? 
>> I'm here. 
>> And gerald. 
>> Hmm. I will check the location of agent gerald. Ouch. I'm here! [Laughter] 
>> ok. I put a check next to each of your names, since you're all here at school today. When you count things and then write them on a chart, you're collecting data. 
>> Oh, data. 
[00:10:53]



>> Yeah, data's all the information we just collected. Hey, I have another way to make a chart with data. Did everyone bring a snack today? 
>> I brought a banana. 
>> I brougrots, and 3 kinds of dip for them. 
>> I brought raisins. They have wrinkles, and they're really cute. 
>> Mm-hmm. 
>> Yeah, and I brought a cheese sandwich. 
>> Are we going to make a chart of our snacks? 
>> That's exactly what I was thinking. And I know the perfect place to learn how to make a snack chart. Ok, scientists, you know where we're going. 
>> To the super fab lab! 
>> That's right! Grab your journals and let's go! 
>> Ok. 
>> Let's go, let's go! [Music plays] 
>> super fab lab! Observe, compare, contrast! Ah! 
>> Ok. We'll make our snack chart on this poster board. 
>> Wow. 
>> Whoo. 
>> Ok. 
>> You can each draw a picture of yourself here. 
>> Oh, huh. I love drawing. 
>> I'm going to draw me with purple crayons. 
>> Yeah, I'm going to use green crayons. 
>> Cool. [Susie chuckles] 
>> and next to your picture, you can draw a picture of the snack you brought. 
>> Oh. Our snacks are the da, right? 
>> You got it. Ok, grab some crayons and let's make our chart. 
>> Yay! 
>> All right! 
>> Ok. 
>> You're scientists. You can try this, too. 
>> Let's make our snack chart. First, draw a picture of yourself on the poster board. You can use any colors you like. Now put your picture onto the chart. This will be the first column of our big snack chart. Look. We have 6 friends on our chart. Now open up your lunch bags and see what kind of snacks you have. Your snacks are the data for our chart. If you have pretzels, take a pretzel card. Wow. Looks like lots of friends brought pretzels. Take an orange card if you have an orange. What else do you have? Graham crackers, apple. Anything else? Ooh, carrots. Now let's fill in our chart with our snack data. Put the pictures of your snacks next to the picture of your face. Each person has their own row with their picture and their snacks. Let's count our data and see how many of each snack we have. Wow. It's easy to compare and contrast our snacks with a chart. Now, draw a picture of our snack chart in your journals. That way, you can always look at your snack chart and remember the data you collected. I'm glad you're all drawing our snack chart in your journals. You never know. You might want to look at our snack chart another day. 
[00:14:11]



>> Yeah. Maybe I'll want to remember that I had a cheese sandwich today. Ah, it was so yummy! [Susie chuckles] 
>> and that's one reason charts are so useful. 
>> Yeah, they--they help you to remember things. 
>> Exactly. Sid, do you have any observations about our snack chart? 
>> Oh, yeah. I was just looking at the snacks we brought. I mean, our data. And look. Nobody brought the same snack today. 
>> Well,hat's another great thing about charts. It's easy to compare and contrast our data. 
>> Huh. 
>> You mean we can see who brought the same snack, and who brought a different snack? 
>> Right, may. 
>> Oh, look. Sid has a banana, gabriela has carrots and dipping sauces, I have raisins, and gerald has a cheese sandwich! 
>> Yeah. 
>> Uh-huh. It's fun to compare all the data in their cute little boxes. 
>> Well, I'm impressed. My scientists know so much about charts and data. I think it's time to play with all your new ideas. 
>> Yeah! 
>> Go ahead. Playtime. Now it's time for-- 
>> good laughternoon! [Laughter] 
>> hey, gabriela-- 
>> yes? 
>> What do you call a chart about trains? 
>> I don't know. What? 
>> A choo-choo chart. Woo-woo! Have a chart train! [Laughter] 
>> how does a chart sneeze? 
>> Um--can charts sneeze? 
>> Well, it's good laughternoon, so it's ok to tell silly jokes. 
>> Oh, yeah. Well, does a chart say when it sneezes? 
>> Ah, ah, ah, chart! [Laughter] [making choo-choo train sounds] 
>> I'm back! Chart express coming through! 
>> What do you get when you make a chart about charts? 
[00:16:12]



>> I don't know. What? 
>> Too many charts. [Laughter] 
>> shh. Aboard the choo-choo chart train! Woo-woo! [Laughter] 
>> now, that's funny. [Pre-recorded laughter plays] 
>> let's play "pretend." I'm the mommy, and you are my son. 
>> Well, why am I the kid? 
>> Because I'm already wearing the mommy hat! 
>> Oh, huh. Well, she's got me there. Hey, "mommy," I want a new turbo robot mega ship. What do you say? Come on, come on, come on. 
>> Well, "son," if you want the new toy, then you're going to have to earn it. 
>> Oh. What do I have to do? 
>> I'll mark a box on this chart only if you are polite. 
>> OH, REALLY? HMM. Watch this. Mommy, will you please, please, please, please put a check in the boxes? 
>> No. Oh, wait. I guess you were polite. 
>> Huh. Hmm. 
>> "Please, please, please, please." 
>> Oh, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, and thank you. [Sid chuckles] [sid sighs] 
>> this is not the way this was SUPPOSED TO WORK. "Thank you, thank you"-- 
>> Oh, lookie there. Ha, ha. I see I only need one more box. Mommy, I really like your chart. 
>> Why, thank you. 
>> You're welcome. Say, that was pretty polite of me, so you got to check off the last box now. Which means I get the turbo robot mega ship! Yeah! [Imitates rock band] ?????? I get the mega ship because I was so polite mmm I get the mega ship because I was so polite ?????? hey, you know what? I think charts are cool, after all. Hey, mom--mommy, you getting your purse? Where's my robot mega ship? 
[00:18:25]



>> And now-- 
>> it's time- 
>> for susie-- 
>> to sing. Go, susie! [Laughter] 
>> why, thank you, thank you. Oh, I'm really glad all my scientists like charts. They're actually one of my favorite scientific tools. 
>> Um--do you like charts a lot, susie? 
>> Oh, I like charts. In fact, charts rule! [Laughter] 
>> ?????? checking out charts charts rule a chart is a handy dandy scientific tool it gives you information you can see with your eyes a chart lets you visualize you get the picture, so do i

[00:20:27]



>> That was awesome! 
>> Thank you. 
>> Susie, that song rocks! [Susie chuckles] 
>> I love charts. I think I'll make a chart and draw pictures of all of you. And then I'll draw happy smiley faces in the boxes. Because you all make me smile. 
>> Aw. 
>> Thanks, may. 
>> For us? 
>> That's very nice of you, may. 
>> Thank you. 
>> Now that all of you scientists are chart experts, why not make lots of charts, about everything? 
>> Yeah. [Laughter] 
>> ok. Let's go collect lots and lots of data and make charts! 
>> Yay! 
>> Yeah! Charts rule! 
>> Yeah! 
>> Ok, scientists, it's time to go home. Follow me. 
>> Hey. 
>> Charts, charts. Charts, charts, charts. 
>> Now, where's my sid

>> Oh! Oh! Now, okey-doke, let's roll. 
>> Let's roll. 
>> Wow, whoa! [Rock at plays] 
>> ?????? backseat driving with grandma ?????? [music stops] 
>> whoa! Hey, kiddo, how are you doing today? 
>> Well, grandma, when we get home, I'm going to do lots and lots of chores so I can get stickers for my chart. Then I'll get my new turbo robot mega ship. 
>> Oh. Well, I know all about chores and charts. When I was a little girl, I had a chore chart, and I had lots of chores to do. I had to clean my room, help my mom cook dinner, and wash the dishes. And where i grew up, we had lots of snow in the winter, so I had to help shovel snow! Whoo-hoo! That was hard work. And guess what. I didn't get any toys for doing my chores. I just had to do them. But you know what? I was always proud of myself. 
[00:22:27]


[Sid's grandmother laughs] 
>> I can't believe you didn't even get a toy for doing all those chores. 
>> Well, getting a toy will feel good, but I bet you'll feel real proud of yourself for doing all those chores, all by yourself. [Sid's grandmother chuckles] 
>> hmm. Yeah. [Sid chuckles] my grandma is really smart. ?????? I learned something cool something cool today I know it upside down and inside out I learned all about charts! ?????? 
>> whoo-hoo! 
>> Scientist in the house! Yeah. [Pre-recorded applause plays] mm-hmm. They love me. [Sidney's grandmother hums] 
>> well, well, well, look at you, wiping up the table with no one even asking you to. 
>> Yeah. After your story, I'm really into doing chores right now-- 
>> oh! 
>> All by myself. 
>> That's great. 
>> Hey, there. 
>> Hello! 
>> Hi! 
>> Hey. Mom, dad, I learned that charts are more than a place to put stickers. We made charts to help remember things and compare them. And the things we need to remember are called "data." 
>> Well- 
>> wow. Sid, I'm impressed. 
>> Yeah, me, too. 
>> Ooh, and now I have something to show you. Ta-da! All clean. 
>> Wow. You cleaned the table without being told to do it? 
>> Yeah. I went ahead and cleaned the table so you wouldn't have to. 
>> Sid, you should be very proud of yourself. 
>> Yeah, I am. 
>> And I'm proud of you, too, kiddo. [Sid's grandmother laughs] 
>> another rocket ship sticker-- nice. Oh, so, hey--huh--check out my chart. Mom and dad gave me 5 more stickers. Wow. Yeah. You know what? Now I think charts are cool. Mm-hmm. Today, we learned how to make a chart and count data. That's the stuff you put on your chart. Mm-hmm. And then we compared our data. And now I know how easy it is to remember stuff with a chart. So, that got me thinking about all the cool stuff that you can put into a chart. Hmm. Ok, I've got it. Here's my super duper ooper shmooper big idea! I want to make a chart of the whole world. I want the chart to show how many people live in my house. How many houses there are on my block. How many people live in my city. How many people live in the world. How many people like bananas. How many animals live on the planet. How many animals on the planet like bananas. And then, I'll invite everybody in the whole world to my house to look at the chart! Hmm. I wonder how I'll feed them all. And that's my super duper ooper shmooper big idea! 
[00:25:49]


[Pre-recorded applause plays] thank you, thank you. Ooh! And thank you, my furry stuffed animal friends. Hey, wait a minute. I should make a chart of all my stuffed animals. Yeah, how many are green, how many are fuzzy, and how many are karate masters. Whah-cha! [Sid chuckles] ah. I am sid, the science kid. [Echoes] and remember, keep asking lots and lots of questions. [Music plays] see you later, scientists. [Sid chuckles] whah-cha! Blam! Whah-blam! Ok, yeah. I just--you're over there and I'm over here. Whah-cha! Blam! Ka-blam! Wow! Oh, hi.

>> Oh, I heard something crack. [laughs] 
>> How you doing? My name is nicholas stewart, a.K.A. Slick. I'm 26 years old, and I'm from flatbush, brooklyn, new york. My style of dance is called flex dancing, and I'm about to get it poppin'. Flexing started in brooklyn, and I was right there from the beginning, and I helped push the style forward. Flexing is a style of bone breaking, hat tricks, glides. We got animation. It's really just an aggressive style. We're from brooklyn, the hardest hood out here. I moved to l.A. Three years ago because I knew I could find my dreams. There's better opportunities out here, and it's a safer environment.My job is entertaining people in the streets. You got front-row v.I.P. Right here, thank you. Check this out right here. People's reaction when they see what I do is, "oh, my gosh! Is that real? Is that c.G.I.?" 
>> I mean, do you almost dislocate them weirdly or-- 
>> oh, yeah, dislocate. It comes out the socket. It's out, it's out. [laughs] IT'S OUT. I want to entertain people. I want to show y'all what I can do, man. I'm 'bout to go crazy on that stage, unleash the beast.

>> Oh, my god. Is that--is that--is that your first experience with flexing? 
>> Oh, I'm telling you. 
>> That's definitely my first experience with--what is it? Bone breaking? 
>> Yeah, flexing. 
>> Bone breaking, flexing. 
>> Oh, my god. 
>> Oh, my goodness. 
>> I'm gonna need a--i'm gonna need a drink after that. [laughter] I don't even know what to say.

>> Mary, what-- 
>> yeah, no, you're absolutely entertaining with it as well, you know? And it just--i tightened my back up so much that I need a-- 
>> yeah, I feel like I need a massage. 
>> I need a massage later on tonight, because I get so tight watching you do that. It's craziness. 
>> But then you also glide over the floor. 
>> But you're definite one of the best I've ever seen, you know, your footwork is great too... 
>> Thank you. 
>> And you're just amazing at what you do. Extremely unique. A lot of people cannot do that. 
>> Thank you so much. And I can't even begin to try. 
>> A lot of people can't do that. Most people can't do that. 
>> That's right. 
>> Hey, listen, I want to see you at least attempt the choreography. 
>> Oh, yeah, that's cool. That's nothin'. That's light. 
>> Oh, it's cool. Yeah. 
>> Yeah, okay, we'll see. 
>> I can't wait to see, yeah. 
>> Yeah, I'd love to see that too. 
>> You can imagine he won't let go of the girl's hand when she pirouettes, and his arm will just go around in a circle like that. 
>> Just dislocates. Ew! Whoa! 
>> Yes to choreography? 
>> Yes, yes, yes, let's see it. 
>> Yes, absolutely. 
>> We'll see you when you get to choreography, well done. 
>> Thank you. [cheers and applause] 
>> Ugh, I tell you, I get tired after watching that-- 
>> I'm sweaty. 
>> Yeah, I was too.

>> welcome back to the austin auditions, where so far, the talent in texas... [all screaming] Has really taken the bull by the longhorns. Out in line, donovan gibbs was already feeling the pressure to impress. 
>> So why'd you want to be on the show? 
>> The main reason, honestly why I want to be on this show is for one, to help my parents out with their dance studio. Two years ago, when the economy collapsed, our family struggled financially, and it changed our lives forever. Our family had a really tough decision to make. Either keep the house and car or keep the studio. 
>> And that decision was to give up our home for the studio. 
>> We slept in the dance studio itself on tumbling mats. There wasn't any showers, so we used the sink to actually wash ourselves, and there wasn't a kitchen for us to actually cook food, so we actually had a portable burner to cook the food on. 
>> Everybody just wants more for their family, you know? [sighs] SORRY. It was hard to sit there and not have a home, you know, look at my wife in the face and just, you know, tell her it's gonna be okay. I say to myself sometimes, "if we had shut down then, you know, would he be able to do this? Would he continue?" 
>> [cries] I OWE A LOT TO MY Parents, 'cause if the studio shut down, like, the passion for dance probably would've gone away. I'm very proud of my dad. 
>> I'm proud of you, man. I'm proud of you. 
>> I love you. 
>> All right, man. It's all right. We pulled through. 
>> [sniffling] 
>> And cue music. [classical music] ??? ??? 
[01:05:24]



>> lights. 
>> Yeah. 
>> [laughs] [cheers and applause] 
>> Whoo! 
>> Yeah!

>> Oh. [cheers and applause] 
>> You're the first person that has brought fire today on that stage. And you know, you had a great vocabulary. You were hitting hard. You showed us all kinds of different sides to you and different moves up there. 
>> Thank you. 
>> You came with a plan, and you executed it well. 
>> Thank you. 
>> Yeah, you can see all that work paid off. I was loving it. It was good, and you're great. 
>> Thank you. Can I say something? 
>> Yes. 
>> You are so beautiful, like-- [laughter] 
>> Yeah, you can always say that, always. Never be afraid to tell me that. 
>> [laughs] 
>> That'll get you a long way in this business, young man. 
>> Yes, it would. Love it. 
>> Who's supporting you? Who's here today? 
>> My mother and my father. Yes. 
>> Hey! 
>> Whoo, donovan! 
>> Hey, you guys. You know we get the dads up to dance, don't you? 
>> Whoo, yes, he should do it! 
>> Oh, he says, "yeah!" 
>> He'll be there. I can tell, yeah. Good man. Have you ever battled with each other? 
>> Between me and my father? 
>> Yeah. 
>> No, no, I'd be kind of scared, honestly. [laughter] 
>> Okay. Mom, dad, step down here. [applause] And, dad, you're going up onstage. 
[01:07:28]

>> Nice to meet you. 
>> Nice to meet you. 
>> Very nice to meet you. Thank you so much. 
>> You must be very proud of your son. 
>> I'm extremely proud of him. He works very hard. 
>> He's just done you proud there, I think. He really has. 
>> Thank you. 
>> But don't expect any mercy from him. 
>> Okay.

>> Should see what she's doing to me. [laughter] 
>> Hey, hey, hey! 
>> Whoo!

>> Of the haunted house. 
>> I do the makeup for the actors, and I make them look like either ghosts or zombies, depending on where they are going to be placed in the haunt. And then we just splatter them with blood. He just has a great time, and it allows that creative part of him to be unleashed.

>> Being that I s-s-stutter, over the years, I've found different methods to mask it. When I make a beat and I talk like this, I can talk very fluidly. 
>> So what made you first start dancing? 
>> I would have to say it was a way for me to speak f-freely. 
>> Yeah. 
>> So I use my dance as--as just my--my--my language. 
>> That's absolutely amazing. 
>> I want to inspire at least one person to say, "don't let anything hold you back." 'Cause I'm not. I'm--i'm--i'm done with that. Hi. 
>> What's your name? 
>> Um, my--my-- [exhales] My... Name is shane.

>> Yeah. 
>> Mary. 
>> You're just a beautiful artist, and I feel like we just had the most amazing conversation through that body. 
>> Yeah. 
>> It was truly amazing. It's just--i find it so fascinating because I was telling her, I'm one those people, I had to have a million lessons-- 
>> that you stood in your room, and you did that. That you taught yourself that is a great testament to you as a teacher and a student. 
>> You have a flow of movement that is just beautiful to watch. What we do with that on this show, I don't know, because i don't know what else you can do. 
>> I--i can--i can say this now, because I've never been someone to have that self-confidence in me, you know, because of--because of--because of this, I am a master at what I do, and I can do anything. 
>> I'm willing to let you do the choreography today. Mary, what is your vote? 
[01:26:16]

>> welcome back to so you think you can dance. We're in austin, and mary is channeling her inner honey boo boo. Meanwhile, daniela bustillos is waiting in the wings. 
>> I'm 21 years old, and I'm from caracas, venezuela. When I was eight years old, I experienced firsthand just how dangerous my own country was. I was spending the weekend with my family at a beach house, and me and the little kids were playing outside. All of a sudden, a black car started following us. Four scary men jumped out of the car. They were pointing guns at my aunt and then forced us into the house, screaming and shouting horrible stuff, locked us in the bathroom, and just left us there. I remember hearing them shouting and smashing things, eating our food. And then at one point, my aunt was praying very loud, and they screamed at her, "stop praying, or we'll shoot you in the head." I was terrified. I had absolutely no idea what was going on or what they wanted to do with us when they were done. We were there for approximately two days with no food and just the water from the sink. When we no longeheard the sounds, my aunt--we decided to break the window in the bathroom so that we could escape. My mother decided that that was no place to raise a family, so she took us and decided to leave the country. When I came to the united states, all of a sudden, we had all these freedoms that we didn't have in my n country. One of the most important freedoms was when I discovered dance. All of a sudden, it became my ultimate passion, and it was all I could do, all I could think about. If it wasn't for my mom, I wouldn't be here. I'm very thankful for my mom to have made that difficult decision. 
[01:32:28]



>> Hey, mom. 
>> Hi. 
>> Come on. [cheers and applause] 
>> Oh, my goodness. Your mother is cute.

>> Are you ready to dance for us? 
>> I think so. [laughter] [cheers and applause] 
>> And cue music. [alternative music] ??? ??? [cheers and applause] Okay, mom, what do you think?

>> Yes, goose bumps. 
>> Yes, when I saw her dance, because it's like, oh, my god. It's, like, my angel, so what can I say? I say that she's a yes. 
[01:34:33]

=======================================================

Us on the five. Again, our thoughts and prayers are with the people of only. We'll see you tomorrow. Special report is next. 
>>> Holding out hope for survivors in a town turned to STICKS AND BRICKSth IS SPECIAL Report. 
>> Bret: Good evening. I'm bret baier. Teams continue at this hour to search for the rubble in moore, oklahoma after yesterday's yesterday's disaster. The national weather serves is significant it's ef-5, the strongest of ratings. Although the extent of the damage is unknown, it's fair to say it's one of the most destructive twisters in american history. Here you see the plaza towers elementary school on the left before the tornadoes struck, and on the right, after. Complete and tragic devastation, taking lives, many of them children who were trapped when that school collapsed. We have fox team cover building tonight. Ed henry looks at how the president is addressing the danger in oklahoma. Janice dean looks at more strong storms in the midwest. Alicia acunya is at a shelter. We go to casey stegall live on the ground with the latest from moore. Good evening, casey. 
>> Reporter: Bret, good evening to you. The state medical examiner's office initially said more than 50 people were killed when the storm went through yesterday. Today we saw them back off the number. They said in the middle of the chaos and confusion, some of the victims were inadvertently counted twice. Tonight here the death toll in oklahoma now stands at 24. Listen to the roar. 
>> Oh, my god. 
>> This is not good. Please, dear god, please keep these people safe. 
>> Reporter: The powerful twister that ripped through moore, oklahoma packed winds of about 200 miles per hour. 
>> I was praying to god so many times, and I honestly was like I'm not going to see tomorrow. I was just like I don't want to die today. 
[00:02:04]



>> Reporter: It was on the ground for 40 minutes, at times, two miles wide, destroying almost everything it touched. 
>> It looked like a war zone. It just looked like bombs had been ignited everywhere. It was 
-- there's a car part in my bedroom, you know. It's 
-- everything's gone, you know. Just in a matter of 30 minutes your whole life is torn upside down. 
>> Reporter: More than 24 hours after this monster twister hit, it's still an active search and rescue operation. 
>> We lost a good family friend and pretty much my aunt, they lived over there. Weaven't heard from them or seen anything on facebook. We're trying to make sure they're okay. 
>> Reporter: A heartbreaking scene at the site of plaza towers elementary school, where young students perished. At least seven have been recovered. 
>> It's been a very heart breaking experience, especially the loss of children in the schools themselves and those who haven't been able to find their loved o, and they're still waiting to hear. 
>> Reporter: It's likely this is what saved so many lives here in moore, an underground tornado bunker that so many people have because of the threat of severe weather. You can see it's a little space for people to put their supplies, a weather radio, and it closes. A pin even goes in there to keep it secure. You can see what remains of the home where this storm shelter is. 
>> There's stairs that go down into it, and it's just a concrete underground storm shelter. Everything in it is fine. We had water, flashlights, sand. 
>> Reporter: As if yesterday wasn't enough, this afternoon storm clouds hung over moore, oklahoma. We saw heavy downpours at times, lightning, thunder, nothing severe, but only adding to the misery on the ground here. Bret? 
>> Bret: Casey stegall live in moore. Thank you. We're in the moore community center where many people came from out of state today in search of loved ones. Hi. 
[00:04:09]



>> Reporter: That's right, bret. Because most folks are staying with family and friends, this area isn't so much being used for that sleeping but more food and information and some shelter. It's being run by the red cross. Folks have dropped off water all day just trying to help. This is where people can come to locate missing loved ones. We talked to gauge perkins who drove here from texas, looking for his grandmother, mary springsteen. Take a listen. 
>> There's a whole bunch of people joining in the help as far as trying to house people, get people food and shelter. We really don't know where she's at right now. We're just on a wild goose hunt. 
>> Reporter: We've also found some bright spots. Today university of oklahoma head football coach bob stoopes came by. He brought stacks and stacks of $50 gift cards. He signed hats and took pictures with folks. He said he hoped just to be a small distraction from all the devastation he's seen. 
>> It's devastating. I've never seen anything like it. I've never been close to something like this, and it's 
-- it's just horrible. 
>> Reporter: And then one of the sweetest but simplest sights. One organization brought art supplies for the children here, so amid all of thi they got to color. Bret? Aleasia, thank you. Hard to believe the storm is rolling through. We'll check in with meteorologist janice dean in new york. 
>> We still have a threat for tornadoes unfortunately for parts of texas through louisiana, up towards arkansas, mississippi, alabama into tennessee, and you can see we've got this line of thunderstorms, and with that, severe thunderstorm warnings east and south of the dallas fort worth area. A lost lightning associated with these, and then as you cross over the tennessee river valley in towards the carolinas, up towards eastern tennessee and kentucky, a slew of warnings here. Even up towards the northeast we had an earlier tornado warning moving into connecticut that has since expired. A lot of severe weather across the map today. You can see the threat continues into the overnight for parts of the great lakes, the northeast, and down through parts of texas, louisiana, arkansas where we have the bull's eye this evening for the potential of winds and hail and tornadoes. If there's any good news here, oklahoma, you're almost in the clear. This front is moving through and skies wl clear for folks who are doing search and rescue in moore, oklahoma. Bret? 
[00:06:45]



>> Janice, thank you. 
>> Bret: We'll head back for breaking details we need to get on the air. If you want to help the tornado vict there's a link on our home page, foxnews.Com, that directs you to the american red cross. You'll find links to donate there as well. 
>>> President obama briefed today in the oval office on the ongoing response by homeland security secretary janet napolitano, fema deputy administrator richard serino, and others. This all comes, of course, amid a series of scandals that have put the brakes on his second-term agenda, according to many, an environment that's starting to generate some unfavorable poll numbers. Chief white house correspondent ed henry has the story. 
>> Reporter: President obama today focused his attention on the federal government's massive response to the tragedy in oklahoma. 
>> Neighborhoods were destroyed. Dozens of people lost their lives. Many more were injured, and among the victims were young children trying to take shelter in the safest place they knew, their school. 
>> Reporter: While storm response is one area where the public supports government help, there are new signs tonight that recent revelations about the internal revenue service targeting conservatives and the government going after reporters has angered the public. A new fox poll shows 68% of the public believe the government is out of control and threatening basic civil liberties. 26% disagreed with that statement. As for the justice department, seizing phone records from the reporters of the associated press, 68% said that went too far while 31% said it was justified. Meanwhile, the president appears to be having some trouble weathering the series of controversies. The new fox poll shows 45% approve of his job performance, down two points from april, while 51% disapprove. One day after revising the time line and saying the white house learned of the irs report a week earlier than previously disclosed, spokesman jay carney today revealed that white house counsel kathy rumler kept him as well as the president out of the loop. 
[00:08:51]



>> What day did you learn? 
>> The same day the president did. 
>> From institution reporters 
>> correct. 
>> Reporter: Carney sounded defensive and perhaps dismissive. We could go down the list and say what about the president's birth certificate, was that legitimate? 
>> They revealed that white house aides spoke to treasury officials about how to reveal them baring report from the irs. Carney said at one time they spoke about maybe a speech from lois le irs, but he insisted they knew nothing about the planted question that let the cat out of the bag. 
>> This has evolved a couple of times out of the white house. 
>> Reporter: They shifted the time line yesterday, as you knew, about who knew and how soon they knew it. It shifts ever so slight tonight. 
>> Henry, live on the lawn. We'll look at the retaliation on the whistleblower in the fast and furious scandal. 
>>> New details emerge in the irs scandals and benghazi. 
[00:13:10]



>> Bret: We're back with more on oklahoma at the bottom of the hour. As the irs continues to unfold, the senate finance committee wants to know how the irs determines tax-exempt status. This as we learned the woman at the center of it all is going to take the fifth. Chief congressional correspondent is responding to the story on capitol hill. 
>> Reporter: The first senate hearing looking into the targeting of conservative groups featured former irs commissioner douglas shulman testifying with the inspector general who issued the report and steven miller, the outgoing acting commissioner. MILLER WAS BRIEFED MAY 3rd, 2012 on the extra scrutiny conservative organizations were facing but didn't reveal it in letters to lawmakers. That hit a nerve. 
>> Why didn't you tell us? 
>> Mr. Hatch, I did not lie. 
>> You what? 
>> I did not lie, sir. 
>> You lied by omission. You knew what was going on. 
>> Reporter: Early on the chairman said he knew what was going on. 
>> It's not on inappropriate, it's intolerable to target groups based on their political views. We need to understand how and why this targeting occurred. We need to know who was involved and who was responsible. 
>> Reporter: Shulman was asked about targeting at a hearing in march 2012. 
>> There's absolutely no targeting. This is the kind of back and forth that happens when people apply for 501c4 status. 
>> Reporter: When asked today, shulman said back then he only had a partial set of facts. Later texas republican john cornyn sought an apology for his con tich wents. 
>> I very much regret that it happened on my watch. 
>> I don't think it qualifies as an apology. It qualification as an expression of regret. 
>> Reporter: There was an apology, not an admission of guilt from miller. 
>> I want to apologize on the behalf of the irs for the mistakes we made and the poor service we provided. The affected organizations and the american public deserve better. 
>> Reporter: Then there was the issue of how this came to light. Lois lerner who heads iergs oversight of tax-exempt organizations answered planted question. 
[00:15:18]



>> We tried to get the story out. The report was coming. We knew that. 
>> Reporter: Treasury secretary jack lew was asked about the planted question. 
>> I wasn't asked about this. I would have advised against doing that. 
>> Reporter: Lew said there was some staff level contact between treasury and the irs. 
>> I was not awafer the audit until I met with the inspector GENERAL ON MARCH 15th. 
>> Reporter: Ler ner was set to testify tomorrow. Her attorney said she will invoke her fifth amendment rights. The committee said she's still under subpoena to show up. 
>>> The truth about what happened in benghazi in september of 2012 is hard to pin down because the story has changed and some of the principal actors are not talking. That's not helping the public's perception of it all. New fox polls find 62% of those surveyed feel president obama could have done more in benghazi. Twict 2% feel like they tried to cover up benghazi. 50% said political reasons compared to 37% security reasons for the coverup. The u.S. Has identified at least 18 suspects believed to have taken part in the benghazi attacks, but they claim challenging security conditions inside libya prevent the fbi from going after them. The best option? A military strike, we're told, but the obama administration is said to want to try the men in civilian courts here. In the meantime, chief washington correspondent james rosen reports on an individual with knowledge about benghazi who is now talking and one who isn't. 
>> Reporter: Confronted outside his home. National deputy security advisor rhodes refused to discuss benghazi. Rhodes, whose portfolio includes communications, has not faced reporters since the obama administration last week released 94 pages of white house, state department, and cia e-mails that showed he and then white house counter terrorism advisor john brennan, now director of cia, played key roles in the development of false talking points about benghazi three days after heavily armed terrorists killed four americans there. 
[00:17:38]



>> The talking points surrounding benghazi are proven political and has focused on talking points instead of the tragedy that happened in benghazi. 
>> And I got the ambassador on the other end, and he said greg, we're under attack. 
>> Reporter: Two after state department whistleblowers challenged the white house account of benghazi, raymond maxwell, the deputy assistant secretary of state forced into administrative leave five months ago, considers himself a scapegoat in the affair. He's the only one of the four state department officials placed on administrative leave after benghazi who does not work for diplomatic security, and he told the daily beast, quote, the flaws in the process were perpetrated by the political leadership at state with the complicity of the senior career leadership. They should be called to the did, unquote. 
>> To remain onnistrative leave until a decision is on their status, they're not currently performing a job for the department during this period. 
>> Reporter: Late today the republican chair of the house armed services committee emerging from closed door testimony by two top pentagon officials disclosed that military personnel sent to benghazi to serve in a security capacity there were relieved and sent home about a month before the attacks at the personal request of slain ambassador chris stephens. Brett? 
>> Thank you, james. 
>>> Still ahead, we'll take you back live to the scene of yesterday's deadly tornado in oklahoma. First, the fast and furious whistle blower who faced retallation. couldn't tempting... ... you thought wrong. Get up to 50% off Memorial Day hotels. Final Days.

>> The army says the commanding genera fort jackson, south carolina, brigadier general brian roberts has been suspended. He's facing charges of adultery and involvement in a physical altercation. The suspension is the latest in a series of scandals involving senior military officers in recent months. The justice department's inspector general released a department yesterday about retaliation against the whistle blower in the operation fast and fewer scandal, one not recently mentioned here in washington. As correspondent william lage la jeunesse explains, it will not be tolerated. The guns we saw individuals buy were turning up in crime scenes in the united states and mexico and we did nothing. 
>> Reporter: Atf whistle blower john dodson appeared before congress in 2011 and made a stunning claim that the u.S. Government knowingly approved and executed a plan to help criminals smuggle thousands of guns to mexico, a plan directed by arizona's u.S. Attorney, dennis burke who according to an inspector general's report was so incensed that dodson exposed the operation, sought retaliation by leaking internal memos to fox news and the "new york times" to undermine and damage dodson's credibility. 
>> I don't think his conduct is becoming an officer of the court. I don't think it's acceptable for a united states attorney. 
>> Reporter: The report found burke attempted to cover his tracks by using his personal e-mail and when confronted, he lied to congress and to his own superiors in washington. Later, burke admitted guilt and resigned. 
>> If there's anybody else out there that's thinking about blowing the whistle or thinking about telling the truth or reporting that waste, fraud, and abuse, you know, I think this report goes a long way in validating that. 
>> Reporter: Republican congressman darrell issa said officials from atf also tried to cover up the facts. 
>> One thing we've seen all along is the justice department would rather attack those who are telling the truth than tell the truth themselves. 
[00:24:32]



>> Reporter: The inspector general said burke violated policy and has asked the justice department to determine if his behavior also violates the rules of the arizona and washington, dc bar association for possible disciplinary action. Burke currently works as a democratic lobbyist and had no comment. 
>> 
>> Bret: William, thank you. 
>>> Overseas, syria and israel tr gunfire over the go lan heights border. An israeli vehicle was destroyed while the israelis say the vehicle was destroyed and forced troops to fire back. This incident, though, marks the first time the syrian army has acknowledged firing at israeli troops across the border. 
>>> Up next, we return to the devastation in moore, oklahoma where rescuers are racing against time. 
[00:28:58]



>> Bret: The national weather service now says the tornado that hilt moore, oklahoma was the top of the scale, ef-5 twister. There have been fewer than 60 of those storms in that strength since 1950. Senior national correspondent john roberts tells the story of those who survived this incredible storm and those who didn't. Hello, john. 
>> Reporter: And amid the devastation here tonight, bret, one little piece of good news. For about 18 hours beginning last evening, it was believed that as many as 24 children were trapped and had perished in the plaza towers elementary school, but moore police department confirmed with me just a short time ago that search and rescue teams have been through that school a number of times, and they believe that other than the initial seven children who were found to have perished in that school, there are no other victims. They've gone through this a number of times. They're very certain that everyone has now been accounted for, so that would at least be some good news, that an additional 24 children did not perish during this tornado. At would leave steady for the moment, at least, the total death toll at 24. Across this entire region, though, many thousands of people narrowly escaped death, one of them, shannon wson, a woman i talked to who lives just a few hundred yards from where I'm standing, her home was destroyed by that f-5 tornado. She and her dogs and her best friend managed to survive by riding it out not in the structure above ground but in a tornado shelter that she had put in just 11 months ago underneath the garage. She told me it's the best investment that she ever made and she described for me her ordeal on monday. 
>> It sounded like a freight train, and the debris, there were huge bands. I knew the house was gone when i saw light. 
>> Reporter: What's that feeling like? 
>> It was really scary. I don't even know how to explain it. I still kind of have the shakes, but we just came back, and I had all my 
-- luckily all my photo albums were all intact. I got more than I thought I was going to get. I'm actually very grateful that my puppies and my best friend and I are alive. 
[00:31:02]



>> Reporter: We found other similar stories across this area including one fellow whose daughter went and retrieved her children from the plaza towers elementary school along with a few other children. They rode it out in their underground shelter. This fella, jim garner, his daughter and ten children, they all came out of it unscathed. 
>> Bret: That's a great story, john. Thank you very much live in moore, oklahoma. Let's bring in now an eyewitness a survivor of the storm whose stepson was missing for hours. Ken albert joins us on the phone. If you could describe to us what this was like. You said your stepson was missing for some time. 
>> Yes. Hello, and thank you for having me. He was actually in briarwood elementary at the time which is another elementary school that was hit. It was just so chaotic and devastating that there was really no communication, and our phones were dead. We had to power, so 
-- no power, so my husband was down there, walking, running for hours, just trying to find him. Luckily he was brought to a safe afterwards, and he's safe. That's really all that matters. 
>> Bret: Such a great story. We have a picture of him on the screen. Just the anxiety of parents trying to reooh night with reunite with children. It's a helpless feeling, i assume. 
>> It was just pure devastation and all you can think of is really your kids at the time and his dad and his mom were just worried sick for everybody. 
>> Bret: As the tornado wnt through and you're dealing with picking up the pieces today, your thoughts on this whole event. I know oklahoma is used to it, but not like this. 
>> It's just shaking and rattling when it's so close. Luckily we were blessed. We had no damage. I was in an underground shelter at my neighbor's house. We're very, very blessed out of so many people who lost everything. 
[00:33:03]



>> Bret: Kat, we appreciate your time tonight. It's great to hear about your stepson. Thank you, and good luck. 
>> Thank you so much. 
>> Bret: A positive outcome there, a positive day on wall street today as well. The dow finished up 52. The s&p 500 gained 3. The nasdaq picked up 6. We'll talk about the justice department, our colleague, james rosen, and the investigation with all the fox all stars after a quick break. kelly, thought... How long before he goes to college?

>> the president believes this deeply, that the press is allowed to pursue investigate gave journalism freely. He's a fierce defender of the first amendment and continues to be. You asked about specific matter, and I can't comment on the specifics of any ongoing criminal matter. If you're asking me whether the president believes that journalists should be prosecuted for doing their jobs, the answer is no. No. 
>> Bret: Jay carney at the white house today. New information from the federal court filing today into the investigation into our colleague, rosen, the chief washington correspondent, that it went further than initially reported. Records have been seized with respect to 30 different phone numbers. At least five more numbers targeted by the government are for this building, the fox dc bureau as well as james rosen's mobile phone. The government, according to the filing, involving a former state department contractor, stephen kim, accused of violating the espionage act for leaking classified information to rosen characterized rosen this way, quote, based on the foregoing, there's probable cause to believe that the reporter has committed or is committing a violation, and it goes into the specific violation. Unauthorized disclosure of national defense information as an aider, abettor, and/or co-conspirator. Rosen stated yesterday, quote, as a reporter I always honor the confidentiality of my dealings with all of my sources and the executive vice-president of news issued this statement, quote, we are outraged to learn today, that was yesterday, that james rosen was named a criminal co conspirator for simply doing his job as a reporter. In fact, it's downright chilling. Uneequivocally defend his right to operate as a member of the what up until now has been always a fee pass. Charles? 
[00:39:11]



>> Jay carney is underpaid. He's saying the president or the administration, wh has just trashed the first amendment, that he can't talk about it because it's under investigation when we can all see it in front of our eyes. Why is this a trashing of the first amendment? Because as you said, they said that james rosen presented this to the court as a co conspirator. Why? That's the only way in which you can invade his e-mail and his other contacts. If you can save the person involved is under criminal investigation, the reason it's a traffic see, there's no chance of that happening. The only possible exception is the pursuit of neal sheehan who nicked the pentagon papers that nixon tried to prosecute and gave up because it wasn't going to succeed. We've never had a case of seeking of information being accused of a crime. So they set it up as if it's going to be accused of a crime. Of course, he hasn't, but it was a way to get and invade the e-mail in a way that you can't, if it's just looking into a journalist. Of course, we understand that the administration is a huge supporter of the first amendment and the rights of the press. 
>> Bret: You're saying a will lot of reporters and organizations have put out statements in support of rosen and in support of fox. 
>> I just think it's incredible that he can stand up there and say that he's a fierce defender of the first amendment which he's said before. As the press secretary of an administration that's spying on reporters, and if he's so offended by this, who has been fired? Why are heads not rolling over this? I actually haven't seen the president express real outrage other than giving lip service to it, and I also think that you have to remember we're focused on the media because we're media, but there are a lot of regular people who are whistle blowers who have had their lives turned upside down by this administration, the same administration who said they treat whistle blowers as criminal but then people who leak information like the kill list or osama bin laden, they're heroes because they make president obama look like some super human protector of america. Everything is completely upside down here. 
[00:41:36]



>> Bret: Just one quick poll from our poll out tody, tucker. The question, do you feel government is out of control and threatening your basic civil liberties? 68% said government is out of control. 26% said no, don't feel that way. 
>> I expect that number to grow. I actually can't do justice to the column that kiersten wrote today to everyone who is watching which is a fantastic description of how this happened. The obvious is the reporter said nothing when this has happened in the past, over the past four and a half years. When david petraeus had his life destroyed because the fbi, the obama justice department broke into his personal e-mail and leaked the contents to newspapers, thereby destroying his whole family, no one said anything. It's only when it happens to reporters. What's so very frustrating about this is the administration can and will and does hide behind classification, so the attorney general said in the ap case it was a very, very serious leak that endangered this country. He won't explain what the leak was or how it endangered america. The u.S. Government has tens of millions of classified documents that we know nothing about. It was only two years ago that the cia declassified the last documents from world war i, a hundred years ago, about secret ink and how to hide it in your starched collar. There's a lot of information that is kept from the public for justifiable reason other than cya, period. 
>> Bret: Here's what they say, that national security, republicans who are upset about this can't have it both ways. They can't say stop the leaks, go after the leakers, and then get upset when they are doing it. That's what they say. 
>> Yeah. That's what they say. They imply that once you determine there's been a leak, you can do anything. You cannot. There are republicans laws. We have a constitution and we have an understanding of how you do this. Yes, you can go after the leaker, but there are regulations and rules about what you can do with the press. It is not illegal for a member of the press to seek information, and if you make it illegal, then you are really making a huge dent and a huge assault on the first amendment, and freedom of the press which, incidentally, is the first amendment. That's what we start with. Without that, you've got nothing. 
[00:43:49]



>> The u.S. Attorney's office in dc said because of this case, it's an open case, active prosecution, they're limited in what they can share. The government exhausted, they said, all reasonable non-media alternatives for collecting this evidence before seeking court approval for a search warrant based on the investigation and all the facts known to date. No other individuals including the reporter have been charged since mr. Kim was indicted nearly three years ago. We can report that james rosen, to his knowledge, was never contacted by anyone in the administration. 
>> Which they're supposed to do which is normal operating procedure. The fact that he hasn't been charged 
-- I'm sorry. They just went through his e-mails and his private g mail and that's okay but they haven't charged him with anything, so let's move on? I want to go back to the fact if they're concerned about leakers, the leakers are the people who are leaking all the information about obama being a super man when it comes to osama bin laden. The people who are being prosecuted are whistleblowers. There's a difference. The whistleblowers are trying to do it to dispose information about the government. For example, one recently released information about water boarding, state department abuses during the iraq war, wasting money. That's whistleblowing. Leaking is what the obama administration does to make the president look better and nobody gets prosecuted for that. 
>> Bret: You know, I just want to point out one more thing, you know. We said the different numbers. We have the documents now, and the seized toll records also relate to james' parents' home in staten island. 
>> It's unbelievable. This began when the administration tried to read fox news out of the white house press pool. You had a politician determining what is and what is not a news organization and by and large, the press stood still and allowed that to happen. By the way, cheryl atkinson, a terrific reporter at cbs, is reporting she believes her personal commuter was compromised. We don't know by whom, but it suggests the story may grow a lot bigger before it ends. 
>> Bret: Okay. Next up, latest on the irs scandal, a shifting response from the whiteouse, and pleading the fifth. to go. This is for real this time. Step seven point two one two. Rify and lock. Command is locked. Five seconds. Three, two, one. Standing by for capture. The most innovative software on the planet... Dragon is captured.

You know, SPIRIVA helps me breathe easier. SPIRIVA HandiHaler Tiotropium Bromide Inhalation Powder does not replace fast-acting inhalers for sudden symptoms. Tell your doctor if you have kidney problems, glaucoma, trouble urinating, or an enlarged prostate. These may worsen with SPIRIVA. Discuss all medicines you take, even eye drops. Stop taking SPIRIVA and seek immediate medical help if your breathing suddenly worsens, your throat or tongue swells, you get hives, vision changes or eye pain, or problems passing urine. Other side effects include dry mouth and constipation. Nothing can reverse COPD. SPIRIVA helps me breathe better. Does breathing with COPD weigh you down? Don't wait to ask your doctor about SPIRIVA. 
[00:49:38]



>> After that initial notification in april being the ite house counsel informed chief of the staff and other members of the senior staff. 
>> You're saying there were preliminary discussions with the white house about the irs issuing an apology through a l lerner speech? 
>> As I said yesterday and as han reported today, there were discussions between the treasury, chief of staff's office and office of general counsel and the white house counsel's office and chief of staff's office about the information release and the findings themselves. Those are three different answers to roughly the same question, the evolving time line of who knew what when inside the white house. We're back with the panel. This is one element to the story and jay carney saying today that, in fact, treasury and white house officials were talking together about when the release would happen. The release actually happened when a question was planted in a conference, an aba conference, and lois lerner with the irs who, by the way, tomorrow will plead the fifth in the hearing on capitol hill, she then talked about this for the first time. Now, the white house is saying they talked about it early on. I've never seen a scandal quite like this, but I've seen a lot of scandals. All of leave you with the same impression that this strategy doesn't work. Changing your story every couple of press conferences, denying the obvious before the irs commissioner coming out, refusing to apologize, and of course, it imperils jay carney's ability job after this is over. Congress is inflamed. Talk to any republican member of congress. They can't decide whether they want to storm the executive branch or have a special prosecutor. It's very poor management of the scandal. 
[00:51:39]



>> Bret: The fox news poll out today, which object scandal concerns you most, the irs at 32%, benghazi, 27%, the doj investigation, 21%, all 10%. There will be hearings on capitol hill probably for some time. 
>> I think the irs scandal scares everybody, whether you're a liberal or conservative, because everybody knows it could happen to them. You always hear stories of it happening. I also think people find it really offensive, the idea of pleading the fifth. If I get audited, I guess I'll plead the fifth or say I don't know. They're not accountable to anybody, and I think people sort of feel like where's the accountability here? There was an ongoing push from conservative members of congress saying this has been going on, and then they choose to not tell them and then plant a question? I mean, everything about it is fishy. 
>> Bret: Today the former commissioner of the irs, charles, was on capitol hill on the senate side. Take a listen. 
>> How did this happen? Mr. Chairman, I can't say. I can't say that I know that answer. I'm six months out. 
>> You have some sense. You were a commissioner for some years. You've got an idea. 
>> I'm six months out of office. When I left, the i.G. Was looking into this to gather all the facts. I've now had the benefit of reading the report, and that's, you know, the full accounting of facts that I have at this point. So I don't think I can answer that question. 
>> I'm disappointed because you've had time to think about this. You certainly have more thoughts than that. 
>> Bret: Democratic chairman max baucus. 
>> Number one, as kiersten says, everybody is outraged. Everybody knows what the irs can do, and everybody's afraid of it. Second, because you now have somebody that's going to plead the fifth in a court of law, the jury is not supposed to interpret that as hiding something, but this isn't a court of law, and we aren't a jury. Clearly there's something happening here. Everybody understands there is a red flag. And last is the fact who was a member of congress who was just up there? That was the democratic head of the senate finance committee. Yes the republicans are up in arms but democrats are, too. Baucus who we saw isn't even up for re-election. Imagine the democrats who are. The fact that you have a committee headed by a democrat and a democratic senate who is leading all this who yesterday submitted over had 0 questions about the irs scandal, and said I have a suspicion there is a lot here we don't know, this thing is going to go on and it could be fatal.

=======================================================


>> Megyn: Thanks fo watching, "studio b" starts now. 
>> Shepard: It's 2:00 p.M. In the heartland of americament I'm shepard smith in moore, oklahoma, and this is fox news channel continuing coverage of the considered damage across oklahoma city and beyond. We're in the middle of a parking lot, and what I'm going to do is show you what this storm can do. Not in a wide picture but one small area. This is the moore amf bowling lanes, or it was. I'll show you around in here in just a minute. Back over here, fast food restaurant, and look here. See what the storm did to the cars? Some are overturned. Some have been dropped in this place. Some have debris from buildings on top of them. There's signed twisted around them and to the left they're working to carry the cars out. How many are the? Thousands at least. Tens of thousands is the estimate at this moment as the rains continue to fall. There was a bad thunderstorm here in the past hour, I'm sure many of you have been watching, saw, and that thunderstorm left golf-ball size hail across parts of the area. No tornadoes today but lots of rain and more damage in some areas, though not here in the town of moore. This over here was the local medical center. They tell us it will have to be demolished. You can see the workers are already out trying to get vehicles out of the way. And in the case they're trying to pull one more car. You can see it. Just about every street corner you see this. You see the x on the side of that truck. In fact I don't know if you can see it from your angle. But if you move this way, you can see them pulling the truck up over here, and if you see the orange x on it? 
[00:02:00]



-- It's right over here 
-- see the orange x on the side? Those are on every vehicle, and these xs mean that they've checked inside these vehicles to make sure that nobody is in there. There's not a vehicle within blocks, if not miles, that will if be driven again. This one was picked up, tossed on its side. Over here is what used to be the post office and an annex for the post office just over there. You can see media from around the country, at least around the region, have taken over the area because we're just on the outskirts of where the storm did the worst of the damage. If you go that direction and that direction, you can't get in. They're not leading the media in. The fbi has checkpoints set up and they're only allowing people in for a short period of time. 15 to 20 minutes to walk to their homes, rummage through their things, try to find the medicine they need, in some cases formula for kids, whatever it is that they need to get back in and couldn't go purchase. There's no power anywhere. All the power that is here either comes from generators from the city or county or state, or from media organizations. So, as far as you can see at night, it's pitch black. And the home 
-- hum of generates is what you hear. This right here that I'll stand ones not a floor but a wall. This was the door to the pro shop at the amf moore bowling alley. You would come in here and they would do work. This is a drill press. You can see bowling balls everywhere. We don't believe these were used. These were for sale in this bowling alley. And over here, right over there, the machine where they would tally the scores, this bowling alley is representative of so much here in that there's really nothing left to salvage. The only thing they can do now, opposite the crews get out of the yeah and the media folks leave, is just demolish all of this and figure out a way to haul it away. I remember after hurricane andrew, going into south florida, and the first thing you realize was there's no way to get around. When you get in the middle of it. Every street looks the same. There's a pile of boards where houses used to be, or a pile of girders and steel and metal where businesses used to be. There's nothing on street corner. In many cases the sod is gone. No street signs so you don't know where you are, much less how to get to wherever you're trying to go, and in many cases that's exactly the problem they're having here. So, everything, if we were to just go around in circles, everything in this area will have to be demolished. Nothing can be salvaged, and that's the case if you go two blocks in any direction and do the same thing. I cannot get enough cameras to show you the extent of this. And the fact of the matter is, just like after hurricane andrew and hurricane katrina, after the devastating storms in joplin, missouri, after the 1999 tornado which truck right here in this very town and took the saying path you can't know how bad it is because everytime we take a picture of something, it looks like the last picture. It all feels like a rerun at home but here it doesn't. Here you wander through neighborhoods neighborhoods and you know who lived there and all of it is ne and there is no hope for any of it to be restored. And right now they're starting over in the middle of a cold and rainy day with thunderstorm warnings out across the region, and the knowledge this will be an arduous task. We arrived two hours ago and spent 30 minute going ten miles from the airport. Jonathan hunt got here statement 
[00:06:09]



-- the same time. 
>> Just flying in this morning, I was fortune to be on the side of the aircraft where I got an aerial view of it, and frankly it took my breath away, stunning scenes. The kind of destruction we have rarely witnessed anywhere. And then on the streets around this neighborhood, street after street after street, home after home after home, completely and utterly destroyed. Here's a glimpse of what we saw earlier today. 
>> This is all that remains of one of the homes that was on the outer band of yesterday's tornado. And as you look down this street, every home looks like this. In this particular yard it is full of what were children's toys and as you go down the street here, it's a similar story. You see the story of lives being utterly devastated. We just found a small toy box still full of stuffed animals. And then everything house completely destroyed. We have not seep many of the people to whom those homes once belonged. Many of them have not been able to get back into the neighborhood yet. Those that have are desperately searching for any mementoes, and a reminder how bad the tornadoes are in this area, storm shelter can that 
-- that may have saved people's lives and if you look down the helping of this street, nothing but utter devastation as far as the eye can see. 
>> Really is a scene, shep, that just absolutely takes your breath away. 
>> When you come to cover tornadoes you get to an area and here's the spot where the tornado hit, and every camera shoots the exact same thing, everybody takes the same picture. So, the devastation at home seems the same no matter how widespread it is. Here, we do go 
-- could go anywhere and the stories of loss are incredible. 
>> They're incredible. We saw so many people today who were just trying to pick up what they can. Trying to find any possessions. Obviously so many of them talk about the pictures of their children, of their parents, being the most important thing. They're desperately searching for those, and people remember here, have been through this before. 1999. MAY 3rd. A terrible tornado, followed loosely the same path. So, we talked to one woman today who has lived through both of those tornadoes. I asked her what is next for her. Listen. 
[00:08:36]



>> Going to move out of moore. We didn't have anything here. My bed was still there so we would have been safe. But we'll be moving out of moore. This is what the second huge one here and there's always some right in this general vicinity. 
>> She may be leaving moore but is not going to leave oklahoma, and I don't think the spirit of oklahoma is going to leave her, either. We were both here in the aftermath of the oklahoma city bombing. We saw the spirit of the people then and I think we'll see the same spirit here. They'll rebuild. 
>> Shepard: It is impressive that literally 24 hours after the storm hit there are cleanup crews and tear-down people and they're working on every corner. It's astounding. 
>> They got in here quickly, and so quickly last night, they saved lives by getting here so quebecly last night. The first responders, and ordinary people are getting in there, pulling the bricks and mortar off of body, finding people who were still alive, dragging them out. And neighbor after neighbor helping each other to clean up. 
>> Shepard: They're inspiring. They don't love the yankees. 
>> I know that. 
>> Shepard: No one does. 
>> It's an honor to be here and see these people getting on we life. 
>> At it. 
>> Shepard: Sadly for these people they're having to too this in the middle of very bad weather and hit my understanding there are tornado warnings out right now. Janice is in the extreme weather center. 
>> Tornadoes in texas and this area has been pounded with rain. The good news is, shepard, the worst of it should be over. We still have a chance of showers today. But the main line has moved southward. Unfarm it's moving south and going to hit possibly more populated areas. So toward watches in effect for parts of texas, including dallas. Now louisiana and arkansas. Severe thunderstorm warnings in and around the dallas-fort worth area, and then a recent tornado warning for just west of the tax are can na area I don't think we'll seal the violent tornado wes have seen in the past two or three days, but we still have a risk of isolated tornadoes. From great lakes and louisiana and arkansas, there's some of the big cities we'll focus on. Isolated towards here. We will keep an eye out. And to give you an idea what we're looking at in terms of the forecast, around the oklahoma city area, the worst is over but we'll see an incredible line of showers and thunderstorms move through texas and parts of arkansas, towards louisiana, and then things should break up by wednesday. So, by wednesday, we should be breathing a little bit of a sigh of relief across the central u.S. But we'll still deal with the threat of severe weather across the ohio river valley some northeast but clearer skies are ahead. 
[00:11:43]



>> Shepard: Thank goodness. They can use it. This is how it has been all afternoon. You see the dark clouds, the thunderstorm hit here at 12:16. And if you come back over here, over the satellite, you can see the back end of th storm, and soon hopefully they'll have a sunset to work with here. Look at the 
-- we believe this is an office at this bowling alley, the moore amc bowling alley, desk, bowling pin still standing in what clearly was an office to look at what was absolutely life as normal with cash drawers down here, which are empty, and life just left and just shattered by the storm. We're going to get to our colleague, john roberts, who has been in moore for much of the day and has been out surveying the damage as well. He'll talk to residents about how in the world they're going to clean this upment we're waiting for updates from authorities as well. Our crews are spanned out across the great state of oklahoma, and if one of my colleagues from the northeast said this afternoon, boomer sooner. Followed by, you'll never hear me say that again. This is fox news, continuing coverage. were jobs available out there. I knew DeVry university would give me the skills that I needed to make one of those tech jobs mine. We teach cutting-edge engineering technology, computer information systems, networking and communications management 
-- the things that our students need to know in the world today. Our country needs more college grads to help fill all the open technology jobs. TO HELP MEET THAT NEED, HERE at DeVry university, we're offering $4 million dollars in tech scholarships for qualified new students. LEARN MORE at DeVry.Edu. ! 
[00:16:13]



>> Shepard: Continuing coverage and a look at the two schools AFFECTED.t- Briarwood elementary school was the first one of which we got pictures, and the early pictures was devastating. The thinking was, how could anybody have survived all of this? But it's our understanding every child got out of briarwood elementary school alive. The news was not as good at plaza towers elementary school. We reported yesterday afternoon in the 5:00 hour on the east coast, as the workers were over this school and picking up pieces of rubble and debris, searching frantically for any children who might have survived underneath. We know many of them sheltered in place in a hole there. There was very sad news out of plaza towers elementary school as a number of children tide in fact tie there we'll speak with a man in just a moment who has a rescue story from the school and heartwarming. First I want to get to john roberts who has been out and about, talking to folks here for much of the day. Came only for your atlanta newsroom to oklahoma. John, I know you have been with some of those who survived and at the stories are incredible. 
>> They are. You talk about the idea, how to fin the cloneup? Where too you start? If you think what you're lock agent here is pad, when you get into what they call the devastation zone, it gets much worse. I was there this morning and had a look around. Tried to get back in this afternoon with a camera but was told by the police that if there were any media inside the zone that would be trouble. You still see structures standing. It's literally apocalyptic. There's nothing standing. The trees have been burned town to nubs by the wind and it's hard to believe that anybody could have survived in there. A little closer to where we are, though, we ran into some folks whose houses were destroyed but still managed to get out. Even though they rode it through. One of the people was shannon wilson. She was here back in 1999, when the famous may 3rd tornado came through. She rode out this one. Yesterday. She didn't ride it out in her house, she was in a safe room, shelter, underneath her garage. 
[00:18:30]



>> I don't know how to explain it. I still have the shakes women just came back and I had all my photo albums were intact and aim grateful my puppies and my pest friend and I are alive. 
>> Even though she sustained a direct hit after being missed in 1999, she says she is going to rebuild again, that moore is her home, and, shep, she said she is going rebuild the house around the tornado shelter. 
>> Shepard: I believe that. What more too we know from the schools? 
>> What 
-- when I got into the devastated area this morning, i worked my way in so I could see the crews working on the school, and it was a very eerie sight. Crane over the debris field about 20 feet tall. As they're picking away the debris, trying to find what we believe are and may be the bodies of 24 children who didn't make it out of there alive. A couple of the children who went to that school, lived in a house just across the street from me. Their grandfather, jimmy garner, spoke with me earlier today. Here's what happened, a remarkable story. He was living in the house with his daughter and her husband, and the two children that went to plaza towers elementary. At 2:00 afternoon, his daughter said, I'm too worried about this storm, we're hearing too many warnings about it. I'm going to the school to get the kids. That was at 2:00 15 at 2:40 she came back. They all got in the! Shelter and then the storm hit about 15 minutes after that. Here is what jimmy jensen told me about the episode. 
>> I'm so proud of my daughter. I don't know what I'd done if i lost my grandkids. So I'm proud of her for being smart. She did the right thing. And I feel for the families that lost kids kids and stuff at the school. 
[00:20:36]



>> John: Jimmy garner, one very proud grandfather and father of his daughter who was wise enough to go get her kids from the school thats to not have any hard safe rooms and take them to the shelter of their open safe room. 
>> Shepard: John, thanks. Was watching the video from plaza towers elementary, and as it turns out we were 
-- I was speaking over that video during the 5:00 hour yesterday as we were trying to make sense of everything that hat happened. We saw all the people digging and frankly, it was a chopper from another network's 
-- another network, local station's chopper with which we have working agreement, but we couldn't figure out where they were. We didn't know they were digging for children there and didn't learn until later that they were digging in one spot where they knew the kid sheltered in place, but by the time they got to them the news was, frankly, quite awful. We'll be joined by this map, justin steven, a father and husband and all of his kids are fine. He lost his house. One of his children', a plaza elementary school student, doing fine. 
>> Yes, sir. 
>> We'll talk to justin in a minute.Ttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttt tt 
[00:25:18]



>> Shepard:25 minutes pat the hour. I showed you pictures from plaza tower elementary school. So many people here watching that. There were a lot of rescue workers, and among them was justin stevens. How are you? 
>> Very well. 
>> You have three children and a wife and everybody is fine. 
>> They are. 
>> Shepard: Take a look at the pictures of his home. Were you there? 
>> No. I was at work but my wife and two little children were. 
>> What is her story of surviving that? 
>> They heard the siren and luckily our neighbor across the street has a cellar and they were able to make it over there and they were fine. 
>> Your oldest daughter was the kindergarten at plaza towers elementary and the sirens wailed. What is her story? 
>> She was freaked out. She said the school fell down and she got a couple of scrapes and scratches, nothing too serious. But the most important thinges she is excited no more school for the next couple of days. 
>> Shepard: Where will you guys be? How will you exist? 
>> As a family, I guess. We have family town in norman, andded mondes, so we'll just stay together and rebuild. 
>> Shepard: Wonder for parents, sometimes kids go through something like this and the days ahead are hard. What your oldest daughter, who lived through the collapse of that school, able to sleep last night? 
>> He says the tornado was bad. Doesn't understand why it happened to us. But she is happy we're all fine and her dog is fine. So she is actually quiteappy about it. We're all okay. 
>> Shepard: Been you notice all of us are in jackets. It's cold and wet today, and I'm like, do you not have a jacket? And you said. 
>> I can't find my closet. 
[00:27:22]



>> Shepard: You've been to the house but can't find the closet? 
>> Correct. At it wedged between a couple walls. 
>> Shepard: It was surprising to see how many parts of houses just disappeared, just apparently sucked up into the tornado. 
>> Oh, yeah. Just happens in seconds. Once second it's there, and then it's not there. The only thing damaged is roof in some houses. 
>> Shepard: As some point did you sit backed a das and husband and go, my wife and children survived the collapse of our home, my oldest child survived the collapse of her school, our pet is okay. Man, we're blessed people. 
>> We are. We're very lucky, because I know there's quite a few families that aren't so lucky, that lost children in school or at their own house. 
>> Shepard: Justin steven, lucky to have someone to stay with. I'll get you some clothes. 
>> They're going to need some money around here, and a that is fema's job to provide it. Let get to wendell, our white house correspondent and is there. Is help on the way? 
>> Well, it's on the way, and it's there. In part. Fema administrator craig fugate on the ground in oklahoma, as are search and rescue teams from tennessee, nebraska, and texas. The president was briefed just before he spoke to reporters this home by homeland security secretary janet napolitano. She will be in the area tomorrow. The president spoke on the fun with the governor, the mayor, the congressman tom cole whose district includes the town. The president says the focus still is on fining survivors. 
>> Our gratitude is with the teachers teachers who try tried to shield children, first responders and neighbors who went to help as soon as the tornado passed, and with off over those who such for survive 
-- searched for survivors through the night. As a nation our full focus is on the urgent work of rescue and the hard work of recovery and rebilling that lies ahead. 
[00:29:32]



>> President said there are homes and businesses to rebuild, schools and hospitals to re-open. He said the country will be with the people of moore for as long as it takens inch a lot of the trouble that 
-- the debate on capitol hell over providing aide to the victims of hurricane sandy, white press secretary was asked if the president could if there on his promise of federal aide to rebuild. He said he is counting on congress not to have essentially that fight again to be able to provide the aid that is needed in a timely manner, and fema's budget does appear to have enough money in it, at least to cover this dollars. Shepard? 
>> Shepard: Wendell, thank verses m much. We're on the outskirts of the damage here in moore, oklahoma, and have been since we about to here a few short hours ago. Getting into the neighborhood is difficult but casey has done just that and will take you into the heart of it all also we approach the bottom of the hour and the top of the news on "studio b." called. you.

In a clinical trial versus lipitor, crestor got more high-risk patients' bad cholesterol to a goal of under 100. Getting to goal is important, especially if you have high cholesterol plus any of these risk factors because you could be at increased risk for plaque buildup in your arteries over time. And that's why when diet and exercise alone aren't enough to lower cholesterol I prescribe crestor. 
[00:33:06]



[ Female Announr ] CRESTOR IS NOT RIGHT FOR Everyone. Like people with liver disease or women who are nursing, pregnant or may become pregnant. Tell your doctor about other medicines you're taking. Call your doctor right away if you have muscle pain or weakness, feel unusually tired, have loss of appetite, upper belly pain, dark urine or yellowing of skin or eyes. These could be signs of rare but serious side effects. Is your cholesterol at goal? Ask your doctor about crestor. 
[ Female Announcer ] IF YOU CAN'T AFFORD Your medicaon, astrazeneca may be able to help. 
>> Shepard:27 minutes before the hour on "studio b." At this time 
-- well, about 23 hours ago we were watching as the storm first began to take shape. And it started with just a little sliver out of the cloud like you might see over the gulf of mexico. Those stay very skinny. This one came to the ground and just poured across the landscape, just raking everything in its path. At the time it liked like I was going over up populated areas and it was, with the notable exception of orr farms where horses were killed. They confirmed today. In the aftermath we realize it hit many densely populated areas, especially in moore, and the pictures ofheescue that have come out of this will liver forever of the number of heroes here at this moment is incalculable, and the fresh faces of the people being pulled out of the rubble will last with us for a very, very long time. And is a mentioned, we have only been here a few short hours after coming into the airport here in oklahoma city. But some of our correspondents were here yesterday because they covered a storm the night before, which is almost forgotten. One of those correspondents war casey stiegel who made his way into moore and is live there for us with stories of 
-- well, triumph over tragedy in some cases. Casey, good afternoon. 
[00:35:50]



>> Shepard, good afternoon. When you stand in a nab where I'm standing, where you're standing, and you look around and you look literally 360 degrees around you and you see what we are seeing, you wonder, how does anyone survive? How does anyone get out of this alive. I want to show you how we don't have a higher fatility count. This is what is left of a home right here. One of many in this area. Right along the edge here, see this concrete wall? This was the garage. Okay? Now, I want dean to pan down here and show, in the garage, look at this, I'm going to slide his metal thing back here. This is one of those tornado shelters. You can see it's filled with stuff because we talked to the residents who live in this home who were here earlier, and they've now sort of pilfered through the belongings and been able to pick through what they could salvage. This thing is six feet deep and is reinforced steel all the way around, about six feet deep, and they put bottled water in there, they put their flash lights, their emergency weather rateows, and then once the family is safely inside, when they get the warnings, they close it, just like this, and they put a pin in it. All right? And then people hunker down in that thing when the tornado rushes over. I talked to a guy who rode the storm out in one of these. He said you could feel the cold air of the tornado and they could feel the ground around them, around the shelter, rumbling when that tornado was just over them. And it is these shelters here that are in so many of the homes in thi part of the country, because of the threat of severe weather, that so many people were able to survive. The reality is, however, a lot of people are still missing, and we don't even know how many people. The concern from officials is that some may be still trapped in these very storm shelters i just showed you. Covered in debris. We talked to a woman not along ago just down the way who is in search of her aunt. They have not been able to reach her because communications is crippled. Lit ton 
-- listen to what she told me. 
[00:38:05]



>> I eave have a good family friend and my spawn they lived there and we haven't heard from them. So we're trying to look at the destruction. It's kind of sad. 
>> Real quickly while that sound bite was playing, I saw over here that you have another search and rescue team makings way through this neighbor. You're looking at that live. I'm going to get out of the way. And they have a k-9 unit there, and these cadaver dogs. Able to search for life under the rubble and also able to search in case nip did not make it and there is a team of search and rescue groups that are in this neighborhood, making sweeps right now, and they tell us that they've been able to go through every single one of the homes once but they're going through them not twice but three times make sure, to double-check and triple check, that no one is still alive and needs their help. 
>> Shepard: Man. So much work to be done. Casey, thanks very much. As we were driving in on the main roads, telephone road and others that come to this area, we noticed as we got closer to the disaster area, people on the sides of the road, on the back of a truck with coolers and flats of water, food to give away. People who came from of what their current reality is, to hand out whatever they could to the people here who need it so desperately. One of the great needs in the short term is housing. With the weather that we have been describing. So their community shelters set up around town. The moore community center is the location of one of those and one of our correspondents has been dispatched here to moore. Alicia? 
>> This is being run by the red cross here and there are 15 families staying in the shelter. You hear about neighbor helping neighbor. This is a concentration of that here. Even if folks aren't staying in this shelter, this is where they're coming for information, for food and a hot meal and this family is just one example here. They drove here from texas because they're looking for mary and mike springsteen, grandparents, who disappeared. Folks are registering when they're trying to find someone who is missing. They also come here and get other information. People dropping off water, sodas and sandwiches. That's happening here office well. We saw people pulling up with their cars and dropping off food. Offering anything they can because they can't rebuild folks' homes but can offer them help. Earlier I heard you mention the need of money. We have seen the nba pitch in, the oklahoma city thunder has donated $1 million to match player kevin durant's $1 million donation to the red cross. So that is something that other people are donating, shepard. 
[00:41:02]



>> Shepard: Kevin durant, hero around here today. This is what this storm has done to vehicles all over the area. Thousands upon thousands of them. Again, I mentioned earlier, the x indicates they have searched and it there was nobody in there. Storm chasers go in their vehicles and follow these hurricanes, and jess has been doing that for us for years. Jeff, I've never actually met you. Nice to meet you. You were chasing thing this yesterday. 
>> Sweat of here, just on the southwest side of oklahoma say there were hundreds of scientists and storm stations here. We knew it would be bad. We saw the first tornado southwest of here about 50-miles and as soon as that tornado started, new storms in west oklahoma city, they back build and saw the tornado come down near newcastle. 
>> That's where their this started. 
>> May 3, 1999, started near one and traveled from one along i-44, much locker path. Hours before it got to oklahoma city. This hat all the similarities. The similarities is this tornado developed very rapidly. It came down and within about a minute's time it widened to a quarter mile. Now two, two and a half minutes into the erred tornado, the tornado went from f0 to f1, f2, f4. Right now the standing is ef4. We have national damage teams on site in the immediate vicinity. We should have a new update sometime before 5:00 today to see if we can keep it at ef4. It was a very, very quick and very destructive tornado. 
>> Map you need to calm down. 
>> I'm sorry, man. It's been a rough few hours out here. 
>> Shepard: You feel about tornado like I do about football. 
>> I'm with you. 
[00:43:03]



>> Shepard: I recommend xanax. 
>> The question is we got to get the word out. This is a wakeup call. We hat a white winter. Back in full spring. 'M it's here. We have a 48-hour break and we start this whole thing over again in west oklahoma, starting thursday, for the next couple of weeks it's going to be severe weather almost every day. 
>> Shepard: I if there's one thing this repines us of, if you live in this area, get a plan together because this season is just beginning. Andly, there are new tornado warnings now. If you are in the path of these things go to local weather noaa weather radio. We'll get to janice in the fox extremity weather center. You can see on the weather map north and east of dallas, east of oklahoma city, memphis getting a little rain over there, springtime means tornado season, and we'll have continuing coverage on fox news channel right after this. 
[00:47:40]



>> Shepard: Continuing coverage now from fox news channel in the missouri, oklahoma city area. You can see the choppers have just gob back up after the storm and that's a chopper to which we have access. Look at the pictures the helicopter sending us. The aerials have been astounding. These are pictures outside this medical center. There's a left-hand of your 
-- got you in double boxes, scott. The left-hand of your screen is video from a few minutes ago of this medical center where we're standing. Are these live pictures now, new york? These are pictures from 
-- these are now live pictures, I'm told, just coming in. They had to put down during the really bad thunderstorm that happened just about an hour ago, and just now the skies have cleared, and we have seen helicopters lifting up all over the place. Most of them news helicopters. They request that the news helicopters go down for a long time yesterday as they were 
-- as the search and rescue operations were underway. The helicopters were so loud they couldn't hear if there were people who needed to be rescued. So the news helicopters went down, only emergency helicopters up for the longest time, and now they're able to get up and show us the devastation and 
-- I know at home it looks like just the same old pictures, but this stretches for so far and so wide and so many thousands of people are affected by this. It really is quite astounding. And then to know there are tornado warnings out there right now. And janice is in the fox weather center. How strong was it? If this your property doesn't matter but it sounds like there are indications at least that this may have been the most severe toward that we have on the scale. 
>> Yes. Shepard, we just got a bulletin from the national weather service and they have seen one stretch where the tornado went through ef5 damage. What that tells me is they probably will upgrade this to an ef5. The rarest of all tornadoes with winds in excess of 200 miles-per-hour itch was watching the surveys come in. When the tornado first standard it out it was ef0, and then a four mile stretch of ef4 damage with winds of 190 miles-per-hour. Now they're saying, windness excess of 200 miles-per-hour for a small stretch. So, we'll continue to bring you up to date. The damage is catastrophic here. But this will go down as the historic tornado in moore, oklahoma. Want to show you, talking about the cool temperatures. A cold front moved through so this time yesterday, 84 teagues in oklahoma city. Watch what happens in 4,000, 
-- happens in 24 hours put the worst of the weather is over. Are. 
[00:50:37]



>> Shepard: Wet and cold especially for people without jackets anymore like we are. We are going to be joined in! A minute by james rushing 
-- james and chrisy rushing. You have had a rough one. 
>> Yes, we have. 
>> Shepard: We'll take you through their story and that of their neighbors as we continue to cover the great tornado of 2013 right after this. I always wanted to design a bike that honored those who serve our countr And GEICO gave me that opportunity. Now naturally, we wanted it to be powerful, innovative and we built this bike as a tribute to those who are serving, those who have served and their families. And I think we nailed it. Geico. Proudly serving the military for over 75 years. ?/> 
[00:54:13]



>> Shepard: Live pictures over moore, oklahoma, as they continue to sift through the rubble. I'm with james and chrisy who live across the street from plaza elementary school. You have five foster children and what do you see in the neighborhood? 
>> Houses being destroyed, and as soon as I seen that we made our way to the school. 
>> Three in daycare and what happened to school. 
>> We made our way into the bathrooms and then the roof rip right off the school and we were just covered in debris. 
>> Your house? 
>> Gone. Totally. There's nothing left of my home. 
>> Five foster kids. What are you going to do? 
>> I don't know. We're going to pray and take the help we can get from our family and friends and stay with them until we can rebuild. 
>> Shepard: You guys had a home that was in an area that was destroyed, in the may 319 9 storm. This polling alley was here and this sip nark all brand new and a great plate to live. 
>> Wonderful neighborhood. 
>> We love moore. 
>> Shepard: At it hard to imagine what it was. 
>> It's not recognize able anymore. 
>> Shepard: You almost seem like you're still in shock. 
>> It seems like the downtown bombing or something. Just seems underreal when ywu come down your block and you're running temperatures your house and you don't know that your house. You don't recognize the school or anything. You don't know where you are. 
>> Shepard: Interesting to me to hear you say you were sitting in your home without a storm shelter and looking down the street and seeing roofs pop off. 
>> Homes being destroyed. There was nothing like it. I've never seen anything like it before. 
>> Shepard: The noise must have been deafening. 
>> Ears popping. It was so loud, you couldn't hear anything else. 
[00:56:16]



>> James and chrisy, we wish you all the best. We'll be right back. ?????? ?????? ?????? I don't wanna be right ??????

=======================================================


>> Good evening, from los angeles, I'm tavis smiley. Tonight, a conversation with olympia snowe, former republican senator from maine, long considered onef the last moderate lawmakers in washington. In 2012, she decided not to run again for the senate seat she'd held for 18 years, in part because of frustration with a dysfunctional congress mired in partisan politics. She's written a book about her experiences in government called "fighting for common ground," about how to fix the stalemate in congress. I recently caught up with jazz great terence blanchard about his new album, "magnetic." We'll talk it him. Those conversation coming up right now. 
>> There's a saying that dr. King had, he said it's always the rigime to do right thing. I just try to live my life every day by doing the right thing. We know that we're only about halfway to completely eliminate hunger and we have a lot of work to do and wal-mart committed $2 billion to fighting hunger in the u.S. As we work together, we can stamp hunger out. 
>> And by contributions to your pbs station from viewers like you. Thank you. Tavis: Many people are frustrated with the partisan bickering in washington, none more so than the former moderate republican senator from maine, olympia snowe. After 18 years in the senate, she decided not to run again. Today as a senior fellow at the bipartisan policy center, she's urging voters in america to demand real political reform, an argument she makes in her new text, "fighting for common ground," how to fix th stalemate in congress. Senator snowe, good to have you on tonight. 
[00:02:14]



>> Thank you, tavis. It's great to be here. Tavis: Let me go right at it. You are regarded by many as a fighter, I think, indeed, you regard yourself as a fighter. How do you juxtapose the notion of fighting with, as some might put it, cutting and running. Why not stay and fight this in the senate? 
>> Because it's a question of whether or not you're going to achieve the results that are necessary to change the current political dynamic. So I haven't left the fight, i just left the senate. I'm taking my fight in a different direction and my book is an extension of this effort to give voice to the frustration, to the 90% of the american people who view congress as being too partisan, but secondly, also, to illustrate how the process has worked in the past, what's gone wrong and what other things can be done now in real time, presently, to begin to have an impact on redirecting the political environment in washington that leads to solutions. Tavis: Tell me more, senator snowe, about why the fight to do this has to happen from the outside, not the inside. I ask that against the backdrop of the fact that you decided to step aside as a republican. Evan bayh in indiana, a democrat, had the same concerns, he stepped outside the senate to continue these kinds of fights, wrote a piece in the "new york times" stating some of the things you lay out here but there are those who think the way to fix the senate, to fix washington, is from the outside and it can't be done on the inside. Tell me why that's the case? 
>> Because I think we have to change the incentives in the political system and reward bipartisanship and consensus and compromise and that does have to come, I think, from americans who can become the counterweight, frankly, to so many organizations and outside interests in the political system and in the campaigns that fuelhe polarization and machinery of partisanship. We know that they have spent money and engaged in tireless efforts to continue to divide so it's necessary for I think americans to become engaged and there's ways in which to do that, through the bipartisan policy center. We have just launched a new website called citizens for political reform in conjunction with the common ground project so they can weigh in in real time, form a grass roots catalyst to bridge the political divide and look for the common ground options, know what they are on the issues that are currently pending in the house and the senate, and who are the lawmakers who are willing to champion that divide. And I've created my own political action committee to support consensu candidates for the future. So I think that we have to value bipartisanship because otherwise there are going to be those who are just willing to continue to enhance this partisanship for their own political gain but does nothing to further the interests of the country as it stands today, so that's why it has to work from the outside and so I can tell people and share with them what could be effective to make this change. 
[00:05:31]


Tavis: So you hit this issue a moment ago, that's the notion of the agency that fellow citizens have to do something about this mess that some might call it a cesspool, washington these days, you call it a lack of bipartisanship. What agency do the american people really have? It's clear that the american people are disappointed in the way congress works or doesn't work, to your earlier point, the polls and studies and surveys underscore that we're disappointed with congress but what agency do the american people actually have to do something about that frustration? 
>> I just know from my speeches across the country and talking to various audiences whether it's on campus, in other forums and people are absolutely, you know, fed up with the harsh partisanship and the bickering that's fueled this legislative stalemate and constantly ask me what, can we do about it and that's why we've launched in common ground project, have a specific website so they can go on there, find what are the options available to lawmakers to work through the issues, to express their voice because i think so often, tavis, people underestimate the impact that they can have on the political process. Look how congress responded to the air traffic controllers, for example. They didn't want to incur the wrath of their constituents when they're sitting on the same planes idling on the tarm macs because of the cutbacks. They responded to that. We can see that in other ways. People ask me on the universal background check. If 90% of the american people supported it, why is it that it didn't pass? I said because the 10% happen to be vocal and organized. The point is, you have to look at the issues and if we want to make progress in this country on the fundamental issues that have been neglected by congress, if you think about the last few years, what have we accomplished for the american people when you look at the issues looming on the horizon, whether it's entitlement reform or tax reform or regulatory reform, we have lost precious time to address these issues and to mitigate the effects they're going to have just a few short years down the road. 
[00:07:52]


Tavis: Americans across the country, after sandy hook, every poll, every study, every survey that was taken made it abundantly clear the american people wanted something done. It's one thing not to get an assault weapons ban on the floor, it's another thing to not even get background measures passed even though 90% of the american people were for it so it's not like their voices weren't heard. Everybody knows they were upset 
-- I put myself in that 
-- that we were upset and we wanted something done so to your point about the 10% being vocal and organized, isn't that a nice way of saying that washington is bought by big money? 
>> You know, but I think that the whole issue on expressing oneself through phone calls and emails or letters is absolutely paramount and making their voices heard. I think that's part of that. I think it really does influence the process to have people weigh in in vast numbers to know that there will be a penalty paid for not being willing to support the initiative and work on a bipartisan basis. That's the other thing. We have to turn the table and at the elections and before that and reword those who are going to be willing to work on a bipartisan basis and penalize those who don't and I think lawmakers have to understand they have to be held accountable and in this instance on the background check, can't be in every instance of what happened here but clearly it was obvious that congress needed to be overwhelmed by the numbers in that 90% who wanted congress to do something about it and obviously they didn't fear the penalty enough, you know, not to follow that route. Now I know there are some differences in some regions and districts and it's not a partisan issue, it's more regional, geographic, but in this case, I think even those who support guns and gun rights understand how we had to make some modest changes in light of sandy hook. 
[00:10:06]


Tavis: Maybe the issue of fear that you're raising didn't apply in this case to my mind as it doesn't apply in any number of other cases because of one single thing, gerrymandering. These districts have so many members 
-- these members are safe in these districts and as long as they do what they know plays in their districts as opposed to what's in the best interest of the nation, they can get away with that so talk to me about how sowch of what you write about in your book has to do with the gerrymandered safe districts that doesn't make anybody have to come across the aisle and try to be bipartisan on issues that matter to the american people? 
>> You're right, travis. All the statistics and analysis that have been done recently 
-- one study said there were 21 competitive seats. Nate silva said there were 35 seats in the house of representatives that are competitive out of 435 compared to 20 years ago when there were 103 seats. So, yes, it dramatically changed. We need to have independent re-districting commissions, that's one of the points I make in my book and that can happen at the state level. Some states have moved in that direction. California has, my state has. I think it's critically essential to changing the dynamic so that you have broader based candidates emerging from these primaries because the districts aren't gerrymandered. The same could be true with open primaries, for example. That's another way to making sure that you have candidates across the spectrum within a political party as opposed to a narrowly tailored candidate that represents a small 
-- 
>> small. Tavis: What about pacs? 
>> No one is more dismayed than I am about what transpired in that decision not only strikg down my provision, it withstood the first challenge in the supreme court when sandra day o'connor was there but they unraveled 100 years of precedent and case law. We have to figure out the real challenge as to how you draft campaign finance reform to withstand constitutional scrutiny but it's something that really has to be done and both sides have to be vested in it. They have to have an interest in bringing both sides together in getting this done for the best interest of this country. The money is overwhelming, the campaigns, the time it takes to raise money and the time spent. It's enormous and those, again, those people have an interest in fueling, you know, the fires, you know, and stoke the fires in the congress, are going to continue to raise the decibels not to mention further demonize people's viewpoints and positions that really prevent people from even taking a thoughtful position in congress because you don't ever have a chance to even get to that point so you have campaign finance reform is a huge issue that i think that the congress and the american people have to demand, as well. 
[00:13:20]


Tavis: We've just scratched the surface tonight on a book chock-full of great ideas about how to fix what is broken washington written by former u.S. Senator olympia snowe. The book is called "fighting for common ground, how we can fix the stalemate in congress." Senator, thank you for your service and the text. 
>> Thank you, tavis. I appreciate it. Tavis: Up next, jazz great terence blanchard. Stay with us. Grammy winning jazz trumpeter terence blanchard has always pushed musical boundaries to find new ways to communicate with listeners. His work has ranged from movie scores to broadway to a jazz infused opera titled "champion" to debut next month. His newest album about to be released is called "magnetic." Let's take a look at terence blanchard and his quintet playing a cut from that c.D. ?????? ?????? at the same time I was asking terence, did you remember that performance? He was like, kinda sorta. Does it get to a point that you do so many gigs, you don't recall where you were? 
>> I'm trying to remember where that's from. That's not good. Tavis: It sounded good. 
>> It was cool. We were having fun, that's a good thing. Tavis: Tell me about the new project, "magnetic," for starters? 
>> "Magnetic" is a new album comprised of mostly original music and we have a couple of great guest artists on it, robbie coal strain and carter. But the tune itself is 
-- i became a buddhist about six years ago 
-- and it's all centered around the notion of drawing positive things to your life and trying to have more enlightened experiences in life. 
[00:15:24]


Tavis: You said two things, I'll start with "magnetic." This is 
-- and I could be wrong about this 
-- I figure myself a relatively good student of your corpus. I don't know that I've seen a project where the writing was this collaborative. Your quintet, everybody seems to have gotten a writing 
-- these guys are talented, obviously, but am I reading that right or wrong that this time you shared more on the writing? 
>> You're right, you're right. Tavis: Just checking. Ok. 
>> It's because I l of these guys have a voice and I'm taking a page out of art blakey's playbook. He always encouraged us to write to help us to develop as young artists. And I think while they're in my band, it's a safe haven for them. I always encourage them to write and create. Tavis: Another thing you said i want to go back to is you're being buddhist. As of six or seven years ago. There are a number of great artists we know are part of the buddhist tradition. Anybody who saw the movie "what's love got to do with it" saw the transformation tina turner made and our friend herbie hancock, talking about the international jazz day in istanbul. We'll talk about that in a second. I know you're a part of that this year. But herbie, famously, a buddhist. I wonder how comfortable you are telling me the influences that pulled you there, how you got there. Because you weren't raised that way in new orleans? 
>> No, not at all. It was herbie hancock, actually. I did a tour with him six years ago and we were on the road, we were in europe for 10 weeks and we chanted every night. And I just saw the benefits of it. One of the things that was interesting about growing up as a christian, I still hold on to my belief in jesus, you know, but the practice of buddhism gives me something every day to physically do and engage in and I saw the benefits of it and i saw how it turned my life around instantly. So it's been something that i have been pursuing ever since and I'm 
-- when I say I'm a buddhist, it's like I said earlier, it's not that you throw away any of the beliefs that you have but it enhances everything. 
[00:17:31]


Tavis: When you say it turned your life around. I don't want to get too personal here, but for those of us who are fans of yours, six, seven years ago, you didn't want to turn around. You were doing pretty good, winning grammys and scoring movies and doing pretty good six or seven years ago so when you say it turned you around, I'm curious what you mean by that. 
>> Sometimes when you become successful, the success takes on a life of its own and you start to forget some of the things that are more important and e of the things that being a buddhist made me realize is that while I'm a musician, that's not all of who I am, you know, and i love being a husband, I love being a father and the practice of buddhism kind of really enriched those other parts of my life. Tavis: I never talk to you without taking the opportunity to ask how my family and friends are doing down in 'nola. You at one point had a house out here but now you're pretty much back in new orleans. Was there a conscious decision to go back there? 
>> Definitely. I had a place in both cities and I knew that I was going to make my permanent residence new orleans just first of all because I love the city but also because of the statement that i think it makes in terms of how we believe in bringing the city back and the city's doing extremely well. We still have things we have to accomplish, obviously, but, you know, mitch landrieu and some of the city officials there and mostly the public have done a lot of great things, man, to help revitalize that city and I'm very proud of the citizens of that city for everything they've done. Tavis: I'm glad you said most of the public. Knowing you, I figured utget there. Mitch is a wonderful mayor but I'm glad you said the public because even mitch would admit they've been pushed the people more than they've aided the people along. 
>> That's a beautiful thing of what happened in the aftermath of katrina, we all became activists of some sort. We never viewed ourselves that way. I always considered might be socially conscious but never an activist but after katrina, we had no choice. We had to be active and hold people's feet to the fire because we felt betrayed. A lot of people elected to office didn't do their job so we felt like it was incumbent upon us to make change or hold the people's feet to the fire who were there. 
[00:19:49]


Tavis: I've talked to so many people over the years since katrina who, for a lot of different reasons, have moved to new orleans. This is your birthplac. This is home for you and I'm not saying this to cast aspersion, I'm delighted people have discovered new orleans since katrina and for a lot of reasons, some who have moved there started out volunteering and fell in love with the city as a volunteer and moved which raises the question for me. It's one thing to have an infusion of people who appreciate the culture but that infusion of people isn't steeped in the culture which raises the obvious question, what happens to the culture in the coming months and years 
-- does that make sense? 
>> It makes a lot of sense and it's a tricky issue. Because it's one of those things where I'm totally engrossed in the culture of new orleans. I love the musical history. I love the culinary arts, I love the visual arts. But one of the things that you worry about with infusion of new people is that all of those things becoming a caricature of themselves so one of the things I constantly push for is for us to really realize that this is still a living art form, it's still evolving and it's still young musicians who have a lot to offer who are not of the tradition but not totally part of that and that's perfectly fine because while louis armstrong was the father of it all, it has to move and grow past that and that's been happening generation after generation but we want to make sure people keep that in the forefront. Tavis: There's re-releases of old miles stuff that have come out on album. So it's vinyl. In honor of national record day this year, the miles davis estate put out three re-releases of some of his best stuff. I just got these l.P.'S the other day. And miles known for trying new things, for being an innovator. Whatever that was that drove miles I'm glad it drove him but what is it that has driven you or what's driving you to be so innovative, to push the boundaries so much? 
[00:21:56]



>> It's miles and herbie and wayne and all of those guys, thelonious monk. Because they never accepted the status quo. And I grew up listening to a lot of different types of music so I'm always trying to infuse those things. Growing up listening to funkadelic, mandrill, jimi hendrix, miles davis, louis armstrong. All of those things influence my musical statement and I try not to shy away from it. You get into trouble when you say I'm a jazz musician so I do this. I think that pigeon holes a lot of artists. I don't view myself that way. I am a jazz musician but I'm a jazz musician who encompasses a lot of other things. Tavis: A lot of other things include this new jazz opera. What does jazz opera sound like? Describe that for me. We're going to find out. You're writing jazz opera, you're writing for solo voices, when you are known for is improvisation so I'm trying to figure out how this is going to work. 
>> Me, too. I am, too. It's been a big labor of love, man. Roger dickerson is my composition teacher in new orleans. I called him up and he said listen, man, trust your training, go ahead and let the music and the libretto speak to you, so it was a bit of a challenge because writing for voice is a technical thing. When you write for trumpet or violin, the range is this wide but the voice is this wide and in that range there's this much of it that can project. This other part may not be able to project as well so you have to keep that in mind when you're writing all of these things so when I'm writing for film and i want to write something dramatic, the sweeping thing, i have a range for the strings to go up and down. I don't have that range for the voice, so I have to use other little tricks and the thing that's been really great, opera theater st. Louis has had a number of workshops for me where I worked with young vocalists so I could get accustomed to how the voice works and operates so once I got that under my belt, i had to readjust my thinking. 
[00:24:03]


Tavis: Finally, I know that you and herbie and other artists are participating in the international celebration of jazz. I wish I was going with you this year. 
>> You should come, man. Tavis: I love istanbul. Tell me your sense as you travel the world of how jazz, which is our creation, it is ours, and yet it's celebrated around the world. 
>> It speaks to 
-- the whole idea of international jazz day speaks to the profound impact the music has had on the world. When you travel the world, everybody knows who louis armstrong is, you know what i mean? And you can hear the influence that jazz, john coltrane, thelonious monk has had on a lot of other people with the rhythm, the harmonic approach and melodic approaches. So for us to celebrate this, it's a huge testament to the efforts of a lot of other people like herbie, wayne, staunch supporters in trying to get everybody else to understand how important this is. And I think, you know, when we did it last year, which was the first year, I was surprised at the impact it had on people here in this country so I'm eager to see what's going to happen this year. Tavis: So the jazz opera "champion" premieres when? 
>> It premieres june 15, opera theater of st. Louis. Tavis: Opera theater of st. Louis. And the new project, "magnetic," of course, may 28, in stores. The new project from terence blanchard and I'm always glad to see you, man. 
>> Good to see you, too. Tavis: Come back any time. That's our show for tonight. Thanks for joining us. Until next time, good night in l.A. And keep the faith. 
>> For more information on today's show, visit tavis smiley at pbs.Org. 
>> Hi, I'm tavis smiley, join me next time for a conversation with the best selling novelist, 
[00:26:04]



>> there's a saying dr. King had, he said it's always the right time to do the right thing. I try to live my life every day by doing the right thing. We know that we're only with halfway to completely eliminate hunger and we have a lot of work to do. Wal-mart committed $2 billion to fighting hunger in the u.S.

CAT IN THE HAT: Why not take a look through my space zooma-rooma? You can see lots of places, like Zooma-Booma. You can see Splishy Splash Splosh, and Wallamaroo. And if you look close, you can see your house too! 
[00:06:24]


NICK: Hi, Sally's house! (Sally giggling) SALLY: Hi, Nick's house! That's funny! One side of the Earth's lit up, and the other side's dark! Huh? Hey, you're right! The dark side looks like night-time, and the light side looks like daytime! How can it be daytime and night-time at the same time? That's a great question! Follow me inside my space station, and I'll try the answer. Welcome to my space station! I hope no one's afraid of the dark, because to understand night and day, we need to turn down the lights! Nighty night! Now, what do you need to make it daytime? I know! An alarm clock, wakey wakey! (Alarm ringing) Oh! (Giggling) That's not right, Cat! You need the sun that rises every morning! Roger that! ?????? NICK AND SALLY: Cool! Actually, the sun's hot, hot, hot! Light and warmth from our sun are what makes it daytime! Hey, look! It's a little Earth! Just like the one in space! Hop on! (Giggling) I choose the sunny side! That means I get the dark side! (Giggling) I see Zooma-Booma! I see Wallamaroo! I see Splishy Splash Splosh, and your house too! This flag shows where you guys live. Awesome! Wow, our Earth is much smaller than your big sun, Astronaut Audrey. Copy that! Out in real space, the Earth's even smaller, but it's not as small as the moon! Whoa! (All giggling) If the sun is so big, where does it go at night-time? 
[00:08:29]


NICK: That's easy! It turns off, and everything goes dark. Let's see! See? It's all dark, just like night-time. Something's missing! I can't see the Cat or the moon now! ASTRONAUT AUDREY: Roger that! The sun lights up the moon, even at night! Here I am! Ha, ha! So, where does the sun go when it gets dark? The question is, where does your house go? Huh? Press the red button in front of you! Look! The Earth's moving! It's spinning round and round! Hey, where'd our flag go? It was right here on my sunny side, and now it's gone! Found it! It spun around to my dark side! Hmm, first it was in sunshine, and now, it's in the dark! Just like daytime and night-time! Congratulations, that's right! It's the Earth spinning that makes it day or night. When your side of the Earth faces the sun, it's daytime. And when it faces away from the sun, it's night-time! My, space is a very spinny place! Roger that, Cat! Press your green button! Don't you just love pressing buttons? Ha! Ah, ha, ha! I'm going around you! NICK AND SALLY: You're spinning, too! The moon spins round the Earth, and the Earth spins round and round! ?????? The moon spins round the Earth ?????? ?????? And the Earth spins round and round ?????? ?????? Spinning round and round, and round and round ?????? ?????? Spinning round and round and round ?????? ?????? The moon spins round the Earth ?????? ?????? And the Earth spins round and round ?????? ?????? Spinning round and round, and round and round ?????? ?????? Spinning round and round and round ?????? Only it's big enough that you never get dizzy at home! Isn't that amazing? And if you want your birthday to come sooner, all you need to do is spin the Earth faster, and the days will fly by! That would be great! If you want days to fly, you know what to do. Whistle real loud for Thing 1 and Thing 2! 
[00:10:43]


(Whistling) (Disco music playing) THING 1 AND THING 2: Uh-huh! CAT IN THE HAT: Why, I like it! (Nick and Sally giggling) Ho-ho! Whoo, yeah! Ra, ra, ra, cha! Hee-oh! Look, there's our flag, and our houses in daytime! And now it's night-time! (Giggling, chittering) Daytime! Night-time! (Thing 1 and Thing 2 giggling) Daytime! Night-time! (Thing 1 and Thing 2 cheering) Whoo-hoo-hoo! Whoa, it's spinning too fast! I don't know what day it is. Oh! (Whistling) THING 1 AND THING 2: Whee! That's why the Earth spins around slowly, just once every day. Hey! Now we know what makes daytime and night-time! We never have to stop playing! All we need to do is stay on the bright side. Where it's always daytime! NICK AND SALLY: Yay! Oh, what a great idea! Only the Earth's still spinning. We can't run around the world every day! Things never stop spinning in space. Need a ride? (Honking) (Nick and Sally giggling) NICK: Thanks for telling us about day and night, Astronaut Audrey. And everything in between! You're welcome! Come back anytime! Good day, and good night. Ha, ha, ha! Ready to exit space station in 5, 4... (Quickly): 3, 2, 1! (Honking) ALL: Wahoo! Look, it's daytime in Wallamaroo! Ooh, and night-time in Zooma-Booma! Spin, spin, whizzy whoo! The Earth spins round, and so do you! As long as we live on a spinning top, day and night will never stop. Hey, Sally! How about one more catch before bedtime? Oh, okay! (Walkie-talkie buzzing) Oh! 
[00:12:44]


NICK'S MOM: Hello, Nick! This is Mom, over! Hi, Mom! Over! Time to come in, it's night-time! Over! Not if we lived in Wallamaroo! It's daytime there, over! Really? (Nick's Mom giggling) Okay, you can have five more minutes. Over and out! Yay! All right! That's just enough time to set a new record before bedtime! Get ready, Nick! NICK AND SALLY: One, two, three... (Cat in the Hat laughing) Isn't this fun? NICK AND SALLY: Four, five... Do I have a stumper of a question for you! What bird runs the fastest? Whoa! Ahem, excuse me, Mr. Ostrich! I am asking a spell-binding question here! Can you tell me which bird runs the fastest? (Clock ticking) Yes, the ostrich! They can't fly, but they run really fast! You got it this time, but next time, I'll stump you for sure! NICK AND SALLY: Time to take a picture with our snap-a-rama cameras! I'll take the picture! And I'll guess what it is! Take a guess! Wow, it looks like jewels! Did you find a pirate's treasure? (Sally giggling) Oh, it looks like sand! You're right, Nick! But what were all those jewels I saw? Those weren't jewels. They're really tiny pieces of rock and shells. That's what sand is made of. That's so cool, Sally! (Nick and Sally giggling) You can't catch me, Sally! Oh, yes, I can, Nick! (Nick and Sally giggling) Huh? Gotcha! (Both giggling) Ready to go again? Whew, I'm too hot! You know what? You're right. It's way too hot to play tag. Too hot to play anything! 
[00:14:48]


(Both sighing) Too hot to play? Why surely not! It's the Cat! The Cat in the Hat! Ha, ha! Let me see how hot your "too hot" is. Hmm. (Bell ringing) Oh, my! It is hot today! Even too hot for my hot-a-mometer. I guess we should go play inside. We'll have to wait till it gets cooler. Wait for fun? That cannot be done! There must be a way to have fun in the sun! How? We can go to Muddy Moo River and ask my friend Hilda the Hippopotamus. (Giggling) Hippo-what-amus? Hippo... po... pot... amus? Why, it's easy to say hippopotamus! You just have to practice a lot-amus. NICK AND SALLY: Hippopotamus! You got it! But you can call her Hippo, for short. Oh, can we meet her? Of course you can! Your mother will not mind at all if you do! (Giggling) Mom! Can we go to the Muddy Moo River to have fun in the sun with Hilda the Hippo? SALLY'S MOM: Fun in the sun with Hilda the Hippo? Why not? And maybe I'll go have tea with a chimpanzee! (Sally giggling) NICK AND SALLY: We can go! We can go! I know! I know! To the thingamajigger! Whew, Muddy Moo River's too hot for me! I'd rather chill out in Splishy Splashy Pond. Fish, don't you like having fun in the sun? Me? I'd prefer to go slow with the flow! Sorry! This thingamajigger only has one speed, and that's fast! Ha, ha! Now, buckle up! (Honking) Flick the jigger-mawizzer! (Giggling) (Honking) Isn't this fun? NICK AND SALLY: Yippee! ?????? Here we go, go, go, go on an adventure ?????? ?????? The thingamajigger is up and away ?????? ?????? Go, go, go, go on an adventure ?????? ?????? We're flying with the Cat in the Hat today ?????? ?????? At Muddy Moo River in baking-hot sun ?????? ?????? With Hilda the Hippo we'll have so much fun ?????? ?????? Here we go, go, go, go on an adventure ?????? ?????? Go, go, go, go, go! ?????? 
[00:17:14]


(Honking) CAT IN THE HAT: Muddy Moo River, right ahead! Yahoo! Whoo, it's even hotter than it was back home! And the sun's even brighter! I hope we don't get a sunburn. Oh, my! How could I forget? Rule number one for fun in the sun: wear plenty of sunscreen. Oh, we forgot to bring some! Need sunscreen quick? Here's what to do. Have it delivered by Thing 1 and Thing 2! (Whistling) Hello! (Giggling) Hey, whoa! BOTH: Uh-oh! (Grunting, groaning) Whew! (Growling) Hey! (Chittering angrily) (Grumbling, chittering) Did I mention that we need sunscreen... quickly?! Oh, uh-huh! (Singing happily) (Nick and Sally giggling) Thanks, Thing 1! And Thing 2! (Laughing) Not for me. I have my own special lotion for sensitive fur and... wait! Thanks. (Nick and Sally giggling) Hilda! Hilda! Where is she? Oh, she'll be hanging around somewhere. Maybe I can see her from up here? Hippos aren't usually hard to spot. Do you mind, Cat? Ah, ha, ha! Hilda, it's you! Why, hello! These are my friends, Nick and Sally! Very pleased to meet you! Ah-- oh, and what is that? It's the Cat's sunscreen. For sensitive fur. It stops the sun from burning him. I have something for that, too! Take a look! Oh, don't be shy. Come and see. Come on, cuties! Look at this. Wow! 
[00:19:30]


(Nick and Sally giggling) It's all sticky! (Giggling) Ugh, it looks like ketchup! Who rubs it on your back, Hilda? Heh, no one! My body makes it, and it oozes out of my skin all by itself! How about that? Automatic built-in sunscreen! Who needs a tube? Ah, ha, ha! We were wondering how you have fun when it's so sunny and hot! Oh, it's never too hot to have fun! Can you show us how? My way to have fun in the sun... is to run! Run, run, run, run, run! Wow, Hilda is fast! Let's go! (Nick and Sally giggling) ?????? We want fun in the sun ?????? ?????? Fun in the sun ?????? ?????? Yes, we want fun in the sun ?????? ?????? Fun in the sun ?????? ?????? Fun in the sun can be easily done ?????? ?????? Fun in the sun ?????? ?????? So let's run in the sun ?????? ?????? With a hippy-hoppy hippopotamus ?????? ?????? Ta-da ?????? (Gasping) Oh, I do beg your pardon! Why? You have a beautiful voice. Yes, but usually, we only open our mouths wide when we are disagreeing with another hippo. I'll be the other hippo, and open my mouth wi-i-i-de! (Laughing) You are such a pussycat, Cat! This is wi-i-i-i-i-de! Awesome! So, how did you enjoy our run? It was fun! In the sun! Whew, but we're even hotter now. Hmm, uh... (Gasping) How about we run in the river for some real fun? Come on! Follow that hippo! Ah, ha, ha! Jump in! Oh, the water's lovely! But we didn't bring our bathing suits! I always come prepared! Ready for some real fun in the sun? 
[00:21:49]


NICK AND SALLY: Yeah! (Giggling) Ah, this is so much cooler! I love to go swimming! (Laughing) I don't swim! I do something much more fun! I run on the bottom! SALLY: Wait! We can't stay underwater like that. We'd float up to the surface. And we can't hold our breath that long. If you want to stay underwater like a hippo, you need my full-of-air hippo helmets, and heavy hippo boots! Ah! That's great! Neat! (Giggling) My feet are touching the bottom, Sally! Yeah, and I'm walking! Look! Cool! Wow, Hilda can run in the river! Hilda may be too big to swim, but it doesn't stop her from getting around. Go, Hilda, go! Yay, Hilda! (Nick and Sally giggling) NICK AND SALLY: Whee! CAT IN THE HAT: Hippo-yee-ha! ?????? We want fun in the sun ?????? ?????? Fun in the sun ?????? ?????? Yes, we want fun in the sun ?????? ?????? Fun in the sun ?????? ?????? Fun in the sun can be easily done ?????? ?????? Fun in the sun ?????? ?????? So let's run in the sun ?????? With a hippy-hoppy hippopotamus ?????? ?????? Ta-da ?????? (All laughing) I do beg your pardon. Let's have some more fun! NICK AND SALLY: Whoa! I can see your hippo helmet above the water! I can see yours too! And I can see the lovely Hilda! Ah, ha, ! NICK: Cool! With these hippo eyes, we can see you without coming out of the water. And see? My nose sticks out, too! 
[00:23:50]


NICK: So, you can see and breathe without coming out! Hilda has fun in the sun without being in the sun! Anyone for another dip? Yes, please! (All laughing) That was so much fun! I wish I could hold my breath underwater as long as you! I only need to come up for air now and again, ha ha! Running in the river with you is the coolest thing ever! And it's given us an idea for what we can do back home! More fun? Ah, ha, ha! What are we waiting for? Thanks, Hilda! Oh, you're welcome! Come back soon for more fun in the sun! We will! Bye! Bye-bye! See you later! Hippos know how to have fun in the sun! They're giant creatures, but fast when they run. They make their own sunscreen to protect their backs, and stay in the water when they want to relax. (All giggling) (Nick humming) Hey, Nick! Pass me the sunscreen, please. It's not hippo goop, but it does the trick. Ready for some more fun in the sun? (Sally giggling) Race you through the sprinkler, Nick! You're on! (Nick and Sally giggling) Walking underwater like Hilda the Hippo. Isn't this fun? Whee! Yay! Welcome to Hat Chat! Today, we're talking to a puffer fish. Hi, there! So, why are you called a puffer fish? You don't look very puffy. Not yet. See, we're kind of slow swimmers. Awkward, even. But we can gulp down a lot of water really fast! Um, and that's a good thing? Sure! If I'm about to be swallowed by something, then I just do this. Gulp! Gulp! Gulp! NICK AND SALLY: Whoa! (Deep voice): Can't swallow me now! Cool, huh? Impressive! Very cool! And that's why a puffer fish is called a puffer fish! Thanks for the interview! My pleasure! Can we see you puff out again? Sure! Gulp! Gulp! Gulp! 
[00:26:09]

[00:02:01]

She knows all about night and day, and everything in between! Maybe she knows how to stop night-time from coming! Let's go ask! Your mother will not mind at all if you do. (Giggling) Hello, Mom?

I was just fixing a few things around the old space station. Would you like to join me on my space walk? (Gasping) NICK AND SALLY: Yes, please! But when I say "space walk," I really mean flo-o-o-oat!

Hippo... po... pot... amus? Why, it's easy to say hippopotamus You just have to practice a lot-amus. NICK AND SALLY: Hippopotamus! You got it! But you can call her Hippo, for short. Oh, can we meet her? Of course you can! Your mother will not mind at all if you do! (Giggling) Mom! Can we go to the Muddy Moo River to have fun in the sun with Hilda the Hippo? SALLY'S MOM: Fun in the sun with Hilda the Hippo? Why not? And maybe I'll go have tea with a chimpanzee! (Sally giggling) NICK AND SALLY: We can go! We can go! I know! I know! To the thingamajigger! Whew, Muddy Moo River's too hot for me! I'd rather chill out in Splishy Splashy Pond. Fish, don't you like having fun in the sun? Me? I'd prefer to go slow with the flow! Sorry! This thingamajigger only has one speed, and that's fast! Ha, ha! Now, buckle up! 
[00:15:26]


(Honking) Flick the jigger-mawizzer! (Giggling) (Honking) Isn't this fun? NICK AND SALLY: Yippee! ?????? Here we go, go, go, go on an adventure ?????? ??????

(Honking) CAT IN THE HAT: Muddy Moo River, right ahead! Yahoo! Whoo, it's even hotter than it was back home! And the sun's even brighter! I hope we don't get a sunburn. Oh, my! How could I forget? Rule number one for fun in the sun: wear plenty of sunscreen. Oh, we forgot to bring some! Need sunscreen quick? Here's what to do. Have it delivered by Thing 1 and Thing 2! (Whistling) Hello! (Giggling) Hey, whoa! BOTH: Uh-oh! (Grunting, groaning) Whew! (Growling) Hey! (Chittering angrily) (Grumbling, chittering) Did I mention that we need sunscreen... quickly?! Oh, uh-huh! (Singing happily) 
[00:17:28]


(Nick and Sally giggling) Thanks, Thing 1! And Thing 2! (Laughing) Not for me. I have my own special lotion for sensitive fur and... wait! Thanks. (Nick and Sally giggling) Hilda! Hilda! Where is she? Oh, she'll be hanging around somewhere. Maybe I can see her from up here? Hippos aren't usually hard to spot. Do you mind, Cat? Ah, ha, ha! Hilda, it's you! Why, hello! These are my friends, Nick and Sally! Very pleased to meet you! Ah-- oh, and what is that? It's the Cat's sunscreen. For sensitive fur. It stops the sun from burning him. I have something for that, too! Take a look! Oh, don't be shy. Come and see. Come on, cuties! Look at this. Wow! (Nick and Sally giggling) It's all sticky! (Giggling) Ugh, it looks like ketchup! Who rubs it on your back, Hilda? Heh, no one! My body makes it, and it oozes out of my skin all by itself! How about that? Automatic built-in sunscreen! Who needs a tube? Ah, ha, ha! We were wondering how you have fun when it's so sunny and hot! Oh, it's never too hot to have fun! Can you show us how? My way to have fun in the sun... is to run! Run, run, run, run, run! Wow, Hilda is fast! Let's go! (Nick and Sally giggling) ?????? We want fun in the sun ?????? ?????? Fun in the sun ?????? ?????? Yes, we want fun in the sun ?????? ?????? Fun in the sun ?????? ?????? Fun in the sun can be easily done ?????? ?????? Fun in the sun ?????? ?????? So let's run in the sun ?????? ?????? With a hippy-hoppy hippopotamus ?????? ?????? Ta-da ?????? 
[00:19:41]


(Gasping) Oh, I do beg your pardon! Why? You have a beautiful voice. Yes, but usually, we only open our mouths wide when we are disagreeing with another hippo. I'll be the other hippo, and open my mouth wi-i-i-de! (Laughing) You are such a pussycat, Cat! This is wi-i-i-i-i-de! Awesome! So, how did you enjoy our run? It was fun! In the sun! Whew, but we're even hotter now. Hmm, uh... (Gasping) How about we run in the river for some real fun? Come on! Follow that hippo! Ah, ha, ha! Jump in! Oh, the water's lovely! But we didn't bring our bathing suits! I always come prepared! Ready for some real fun in the sun? NICK AND SALLY: Yeah! (Giggling) Ah, this is so much cooler! I lo to go swimming! (Laughing) I don't swim! I do something much more fun! I run on the bottom! SALLY: Wait! We can't stay underwater like that. We'd float up to the surface. And we can't hold our breath that long. If you want to stay underwater like a hippo, you need my full-of-air hippo helmets, and heavy hippo boots! Ah! That's great! Neat! (Giggling) My feet are touching the bottom, Sally! Yeah, and I'm walking! Look! Cool! Wow, Hilda can run in the river! Hilda may be too big to swim, but it doesn't stop her from getting around. Go, Hilda, go! Yay, Hilda! 
[00:21:52]


(Nick and Sally giggling) NICK AND SALLY: Whee! CAT IN THE HAT: Hippo-yee-ha! ?????? We want fun in the sun ?????? ?????? Fun in the sun ?????? ?????? Yes, we want fun in the sun ?????? ?????? Fun in the sun ?????? ?????? Fun in the sun can be easily done ?????? ?????? Fun in the sun ?????? ?????? So let's run in the sun ?????? With a hippy-hoppy hippopotamus ?????? ?????? Ta-da ?????? (All laughing) I do beg your pardon. Let's have some more fun! NICK AND SALLY: Whoa! I can see your hippo helmet above the water! I can see yours too! And I can see the lovely Hilda! Ah, ha, ha! NICK: Cool! With these hippo eyes, we can see you without coming out of the water. And see? My nose sticks out, too! NICK: So, you can see and breathe without coming out! Hilda has fun in the sun without being in the sun! Anyone for another dip? Yes, please! (All laughing) That was so much fun! I wish I could hold my breath underwater as long as you! I only need to come up for air now and again, ha ha! Running in the river with you is the coolest thing ever! And it's given us an idea for what we can do back home! More fun? Ah, ha, ha! What are we waiting for? Thanks, Hilda! Oh, you're welcome! Come back soon for more fun in the sun! We will! Bye! Bye-bye! See you later! Hippos know how to have fun in the sun! They're giant creatures, but fast when they run. They make their own sunscreen to protect their backs, and stay in the water when they want to relax. (All giggling) 
[00:23:53]


(Nick humming) Hey, Nick! Pass me the sunscreen, please. It's not hippo goop, but it does the trick. Ready for some more fun in the sun? (Sally giggling) Race you through the sprinkler, Nick! You're on! (Nick and Sally giggling) Walking underwater like Hilda the Hippo. Isn't this fun? Whee! Yay! Welcome to Hat Chat! Today, we're talking to a puffer fish. Hi, there!

Sure! If I'm about to be swallowed by something, then I just do this. Gulp! Gulp! Gulp! NICK AND SALLY: Whoa! (Deep voice): Can't swallow me now! Cool, huh? Impressive! Very cool!

Chimps, they do, chimps, they see ?????? ?????? Chimps, they look a lot like me ?????? 
[00:26:10]


(Nick and Sally giggling, chimpanzees screeching) I'm in an African savannah on a jungle patrol, surrounded by green at this old water hole. A good place to be, at least that's what I think, for so many animals come here to drink. The black-and-white zebras arrive in a crowd. So do the monkeys, who are terribly loud! The elephants plod down their very worn path. They drink and they spray; that's an elephant's bath. A giraffe braces his legs, dipping down for a sip, with his extra-long tongue flipping over his lip. And there's a small oxpecker perched on his back, eating ticks, eating fleas. It's his favorite snack! But all of the animals step to one side when the king of the beasts wants his thirst satisfied. They're all shapes and sizes, with fur, skin or feather. An African water hole brings the creatures together! Abracadabra! Announcer: Pbs kids is planning a playdate so big, so gurrific it's gonna last a whole week long. Let's go camping! Announcer: Get ready for playdate week on "daniel tiger's neighborhood." Hiya, toots! I'm here to play! Announcer: A whole week filled with new adventures with everyone's favorite little tiger. I've been waiting to play with you! Announcer: Come along to "daniel tiger's neighborhood" playdate week all this week on pbs kids or watch daniel anytime at pbskids.Org. Announcer: Want to hear some dynamite dino news? We want to hear it! "Dinosaur train" is on weekdays. Really? You kidding? Yeah! Yeah!

( Cheers and applause) 
>> Stephen: Welcome to the report, everybody. 
[ Cheers and applause ] good to have you with us. 
>> Stephen! Stephen! Stephen! 
[ Cheers and applause ] 
>> Stephen: Oh, I love a zombie army. Have a seat. Nation, you know, folks, if you watch the news like I do, it seems like lately president obama cannot swing a dead cat without hitting some sort of scandal. Which reminds me, what's he doing with all these dead cats? The challenge is, folks, which one to cover. As always, I look to my journalistic heroes: Cronkite, murrow, barker. So tonight, I am proud to introduce for the first time on the colbert report the obama scandal booth. 
[ Cheers and applause ] welcome. Welcome to the obama scandal booth. Brought to you by mazda and the scandalously sleek redesign of the all new 2014 mazda six. Mazda: It's not your father's oldsmobile. Because it's a mazda. Now inside this booth are slips of paper, each with the name of a white house scandal: I.R.S., a.P., Benghazi, immortal scorpion soldiers. Oh, it's coming out. And just moments from now, ladies and gentlemen, I will enter the booth and, like my colleagues, grasp wildly at any accusation that floats past. Ten seconds... 
[00:02:20]



[ Cheers and applause ] jimmy, ten seconds on the clock, please. Jimmy. Let's get ready to scandal. 
[ Cheers and applause ] and tonight's scandal is benghazi. 
[ Cheers and applause ] yes, benghazi. Following the tragic attacks of eight months ago, benghazi and the rumored cover-up has become problem number one for the obama administration. 
>> Some republicans say the benghazi scandal will cause president obama's downfall. A survey from public policy polling shows 41% of republicans consider it is to be the biggest political scandal in american history. 
>> Stephen: Yes, benghazi is the biggest scandal since sliced bread was caught funneling money to nicaraguan death squads. Folks, if republicans are angry now, imagine how they'll feel when they learn where benghazi is. 
>> Of the republicans 39% don't know where benghazi is. 6% think it's in cube I can't... 
[ Cheers and applause ] 
>> Stephen: Folks, I say this just proves that the scandal is global from benghazi, argentina, all the way to benghazi, japan. This could even hurt obama in his hometown of benghazi, illinois. Now, republicans have accused the white house and state department of partisan, political white washing of the talking points that ambassador susan rice used on the sunday shows after the attack to help obama's re-election. But white house spokesman jay carney repeatedly denied the white house or state department made substantive changes to the talking points but on may 10, abc news super sleuth jonathan karl uncovered an email from the white house's deputy national security advisor ben rhodes and john karl quoted, quote, we must make sure that the talking points reflect all agency equities including those of the state department. A white house email implicating the state department and boom goes the scandal-mite. You see with this email jay carney is a liar and these folks are in this scandal up to their ball-ghazis. End of story. Except the actual story. 
[00:05:12]



>> We obtained an actual copy of the ben rhodes' email. And he doesn't mention the state department. He doesn't mention talking points. 
>> There is no evidence, scott, the white house orchestrated these changes. 
>> There is no indication in any of these emails of any partisan deleting, scrubbing of the facts. 
>> Stephen: Shut up, chris. You're on fox news, for god's sakes. 
[ Cheers and applause ] I mean, what part of "fair and balancedded" do you understand? Anyway, so what. Jonathan karl didn't need the original email. He has a simple explanation. "This is how I reported the contents of that email, quoting verbatim a source who reviewed the original documents and shared detailed notes." Yes, karl never saw the email so when he quoted from it, those quotes were in quotes. I mean, that's just what you call journalism. Now I was surprised... 
[ Cheers and applause ] I was surprised that this past sunday jon karl wasn't on "this week with george stephanapolous" or at the very least "walking back your statements with the stars." But nation, tomorrow night, i will have an ex-clues I've interview with jonathan karl to discuss the benghazi emails. 
[ Cheers and applause ] thank you. That really wasn't necessary. I just received a confirmation email from jonathan karl himself in which he writes, quote, i would love to appear on the colbert report. My name is jonathan karl. P.S., My lower body is mostly racoon. 
[00:07:13]



( Applause ) now, I am aware that some questions have arisen. Is that email real? Yes. Did I write it myself? Perhaps. Did I personally sign up for the email address "hot karl 4 you at g-mail dot-com? Yes. But it had nothing to do with this story. The point is, I quoted that email verbatim. And if need be, I will get confirmation. Let me just make a little call here. It's confirmed. Are you sure? Yes. Confirmed. 
[ Cheers and applause ] so benghazi, done. What's next? Let's head back over to the mazda scandal booth. 
[ Cheers and applause ] welcome to the mazda scandal booth. Mazda, it's what's for dinner. All right. All right. Jimmy, let's swirl up some journalism. 
[ Cheers and applause ] irs. 
[ Cheers and applause ] the internal revenue service, which reminds me, if anyone asks, that booth is my home office. Also my son. Folks, the i.R.S. Has recently admitted singling out applications for tax-exempt status from groups with words like tea party, patriots, 9-12, or said they wanted to make america a better place to live. These flagged groups were which led to massive dplais a process which fox news describes as slow walking which also describes their viewers. 
[00:09:34]



( Applause ) and last week, the scandal claimed its first victim. 
>> Now to washington where the i.R.S. Scandal has caused the man at the top to lose his job. Steve miller had been acting commissioner of the agency for just six months. 
>> Stephen: Yes, obama dumped acting i.R.S. Commissioner steve miller and I say it's about time. My sources tell me he's a joker, a smoker and a midnight toker. 
( Applause ) and often uses the alias maurice. Now, the tax exempt group singled out by the i.R.S. Are all social welfare organizations KNOWN AS 501(C)4s. Warning: The following footage con tapes graphic depictions of the u.S. Tax code. 
>> The c-4 designation grew in value in 2010 right after the supreme court said corporations could spend unlimited cash on elections, c-4 applications more than doubled. C4s ARE SPECIFICALLY FORBIDDEN To make politics their primary activity but one advantage, they don't have to reveal their donors 
>> Stephen: A c-4 is like a super pac that doesn't have to reveal its donors which means they could be anyone from one of the koch brothers all the way to the other koch brother. And it is all perfectly legal as long as politics isn't the group's primary activity meaning your 501(c)4 can spend 49% of its efforts producing ads alling barack obama a socialist as long as it spends the other 51% doing something good for the community like educating our children that barack obama is a socialist. 
( Applause ) now, many of you may know I have my own 501(c)4, colbert super pac s-h-h or shhhh. And folks, I hope you're sitting down because I have never received i.R.S. Approval for my c-4. 
[00:11:49]


(Audience groans) 
>> Stephen: Very good. Is it possible that this whole scandal is really about me? I'll check. 
>> It's about you. Knew it. 
[ Cheers and applause ] when we return, we will get to the bottom of me. With super starry leches lawyer trevor potter. We'll be right back. 
[00:14:53]



[ Cheers and applause ] 
>> Stephen: Welcome back, everybody. Folks, in case you just joined our broadcast, in the a-block of tonight's program, we discovered that my 501(c)4, colbert super pac shh was targeted by the obama administration despite the fact that ever since the scandal broke the i.R.S. Has approved dozens of conservative tea party groups. Yeah, the scandal breaks and the i.R.S. Caves faster than a spelunker on meth. Here to tell me why I am on obama's hit list, please welcome general counsel for the 2008 McCAIN CAMPAIGN, FORMER F.E.C. Chairman and my personal lawyer trevor potter in the mazda scandal booth. Trevor potter, everybody. 
[ Cheers and applause ] trevor, thanks so much. Have a seat. All right. Now, trevor, let's talk scandal. This i.R.S. Thing is actually bad. Isn't it? 
>> It is. It's a real problem for the i.R.S. And those employees did something they should not have done 
>> Stephen: Let's get to the heat of the meat. Why has my application for tax-exempt status for my 501(c)4 never been granted? 
>> Because we never filed it. Stephen: But I have a 501(c)4. 
>> Yes, you do. It's delaware corporation. 
>> Stephen: Yeah. It's doing business Stephen: Hundreds of thousands of dollars have passed through it. 
>> At least Stephen: Now how is that possible that I didn't apply? Am I breaking the law? 
>> No. Your lawyers advised you that there is no legal requirement that you file with the i.R.S. An application for exemption 
[00:16:57]



>> Stephen: So, wait a second. So you can form a 501(c)4 without asking to form one. 
>> Right Stephen: So these tea party anti-big government organizations didn't have to ask big government for permission, but they did anyway? 
>> Right. Stephen: What? What a bunch of pussies. 
( Applause ) okay. All right. The i.R.S. Is taking a lot of heat. 
>> A lot of heat Stephen: Anyone who applied for tax-exempt status right now, like conservative tea party organizations the i.R.S. Would be under some pressure to approve them. Wouldn't they? 
>> That would put them in a very awkward position. It would look political. 
>> Stephen: That sounds like something I would like to do. Okay. So could I apply now? 
>> Yeah Stephen: Okay. Where would I get an application? 
>> Your lawyer would draft one for you, a 1024, give it to you to sign and then we'd file it 
>> Stephen: Do you know of anyone who might have one of those? 
>> I just happen to, yes. It's right here. 
>> Stephen: All right. All right. Okay. Trevor, can I file under a different name because colbert super pac shhh isn't sufficiently tea party enough for me. 
>> Sure. You can do a nickname like a "doing business as" name 
>> Stephen: Something to put a little bit more pressure on the i.R.S., Okay. I was thinking maybe "making america a better tea party patriot 9-12 place to constitution america tea party nominally social welfare conservative political action tea party secret money liberty i dare you to deny this application of america te party." 
>> That ought to do it. Stephen: All right. Right here? 
>> Right there Stephen: There that is and, trevor, let's do this thing. Trevor potter. 
>> Thank you. 
[00:19:00]


Stephen: Trevor potter, we'll be right back. 
[ Cheers and applause ] 
[00:21:40]



[ cheers and applause ] 
>> Stephen: Welcome back, everybody. My guest tonight is a pulitzer prize-winning environmental journalist. To pick him up tonight I sent a flaming limosine. Please welcome david sassoon. 
[ Cheers and applause ] hey, mr. Sassoon, good to see you. Thanks for coming on. You are the founder and publisher of something called inside climate news. Three of your reporters won the pulitzer prize this year. Those stories have been collected into an e-book called "inside the biggest oil spiff you've never heard of." 
>> That's correct Stephen: First of all, what is inside climate news? 
>> Inside climate news is a face of the new journalism. We are an on-line publication. We cover energy and climate news and fill the gaps that mainstream journalism is leaving uncovered 
>> Stephen: You're the face of the new journalism out there. Do you guys have a scandal booth? 
>> We don't Stephen: Everyone is going to do that. From now on, everyone will have a scandal booth. Why are you covering environmental stories? Because a lot of news organizations are closing their environmental desks. "New york times" closed their environmental desk last year. That's all the news that is is fit to print. Doesn't that prove that your environmental news is not fit to print? 
>> No. Stephen: Or blog or whatever you kids call it. 
>> They made an error in closing down their environment desk and getting rid of their two environment editors 
>> Stephen: You're more lefty than the "new york times." That's what it sounds like to me. 
>> Not at all Stephen: Yes you are. The environment wraps everybody together in one 
>> Stephen: It may, but talking about the environment is lefty. 
>> No, not at all Stephen: It is totally left. The far right fringe talks about climate incessantly. 
[00:23:42]



>> Stephen: Why? Because they want to say it's not happening 
>> Stephen: It's not though. It is Stephen: The climate isn't happening. We're in the climate. It's not happening. See this air. See this stuff between us. That's climate. Nothing happening. 
>> Right Stephen: That's the environment. This is our environment. Can't see it. 
>> We in the business don't say climate change. We just say climate. I meant to say climate change is happening 
>> Stephen: Let's talk about pipeline securi you guys won this thing because of something called the dilbit disaster. It happened in kalamazoo michigan. 
>> That's right. One million gallons of dilutedded buy due mean that comes from the tar sands of alberta. It starts out almost mike peanut butter. They dilute it 
>> Stephen: With what? Jelly? 
>> That's good. It might be better. 
>> Stephen: This is stuff that's still in arkansas. 
>> That's right. In arkansas too. 
>> Stephen: I heard about the arkansas story a lot. How come I didn't hear more about this kalamazoo? 
>> Because it happened right after the big b.P. Oil spill in the gulf. Nobody was paying attention. Everybody thought it would be cleaned up in a hurry. Guess what. It's not cleaned up yet. Three years later. The reason is the peanut butter and the diluted stuff, they make it flow through pipelines with, okay, when the pipeline ruptured, the diluted stuff evaporated and the peanut butter sank to the bottom of the river 
>> Stephen: So it's gone. No. Stephen: I can't see it. I can't see it. Out of sight out of mind. You've heard of that. 
>> You can swim in it Stephen: I don't swim in kalamazoo. 
>> You can eat the fish that comes out of it 
>> Stephen: Don't eat fish in kalamazoo. 
>> It's a problem 
[00:25:43]


Stephen: I'm sure it's a problem but why do we have to talk about it? If we ignore the environment won't it just go away? 
>> No, it will hit you up side the head 
>> Stephen: Good luck being the new voice of journalism for the world. Thank you very much. David sassoon. Inside climate news dot-org. Thank you very much.

>> Stephen: Tonight, an unexpected treatment for heart disease. So if you're having a heart attack right now, stick around. [Laughter] then is the government meddling in our private lives? I happen to know they've been handling my mail. And my guest, harvard professor noah feldman says our relationship with china is like a destructive marriage. Maybe so, but the make-up war is going to be hot. [Laughter] a london auction house is offering a rare christmas card signed by adolf hitler. Even more rare, his happy hanukkah card. This is "the colbert report." Captioning sponsored by comedy central [theme music playing] [cheering and applause] 
>> Stephen: Hey, welcome to "the report," everybody. Thank you for joining us. [Audience chanting "stephen"] 
>> Stephen: Thank you so much, folks. [Cheering and applause] folks, I hope you're feeling good. Sit down, everybody. Folks, I hope you're feeling good, and if you're nottic 
-- not, I've got some good news to report, tonight justice has been served for a cold-blooded killer who has been at large for over 150 years. Of course, I'm talking about the pathogen that caused the irish potato famine. Scientists in england extracted d.N.A. From 19th century plant samples to identify the disease at long last, and just as I suspectedded, it was the phytophthora nfestans herb-1 strain. And I bet all you armchair epidemologists who thought it was the 1-b haplotype feel like 
[00:02:32]


[bleeped] now. Now, I don't have to tell you that p. Infestans here is a fungal infection, meaning all the potatoes in ireland basically had jock itch. The whole thing could have been avoided with a single can of cruex. Instead it was the worst plague to hit the irish since whatever keeps destroying michael flatly's shirts. [Laughter] it wiped out a million of my countrymen, and worse, it forced lucky charms to start putting marshmallows in its cereal instead of delicious potatoes. Not to mention, having lost all their potatoes, the irish had no way to power their clocks. Truly dark days, folks. Nation, I always say, "feed a fever, starve a cold, blackmail a cough. ," Because I have photos of that cough doing things that would make you sick. This is cheating death with dr. Stephent. Colbert d.F.A. [Cheering and applause] first up, a disclaimer: I am not a medical doctor. I have an honorary doctorate in fine arts, which means I can prescribe antidepressants to cure your blue period. [Laughter] now, as always, tonight cheating death is brought to you by prescott pharmaceuticals. When you think prescott, it means our medicine has not caused permanent brain damage. First up, folks, heart health. Now, for any of my viewers who might have a heart, listen up. This next story affects you. 
>> Scientists are saying a little sun can help your blood pressure. In a new study, studies have shown exposure to the sun's rays cuts blood pressure and cuts the risk of heart attack and stroke. 
[00:04:36]



>> It turns out I wasn't being cruel to those apts. I was reducing their risk of stroke. [Laughter] now, the reduced... The researchers at the university of edinburgh had volunteers sit under a tanning lamp for two, 20-minute sessions and saw that blood pressure dropped significantly for one hour following exposure to u.V. Rays. U.V. Rays are good for your heart, that's why I've always called sun block "the silent killer." Of course, like any medication, sun exposure has its pitfalls, but the study's author assures us we suspect that the benefits to heart healthof sunlight will outweigh the risk of skin cancer. That is the kind of vague suspicion I'm willing to bet my life on. Of course, the discovery... [Applause] [cheering] beautiful picture of a sun. Of course... People love photos of the sun. Of course, the discovery that sunlight can treat your high blood pressure is a direct threat to the sales of existing blood pressure medications like: Norvasc, zestril, hygroton, esidrix, lozol, mykrox, bumex, edecrin, lasix, demadex, midamor, aldactone, dyrenium, atenolo, lismelin, serpasil, catapres, wytensin, tenex, aldomet, cardura, minipress, hytrin, sectral, tenormin, apresoline, cozaar, benicar, diovan, capoten, altace, prinivil, lopresor, toprol, corgard, levatol, cardizem, dilacor, adalat, procardia, and tekturna. And I have to tell you, the idea that this sun study could eat into the profits of these pharmaceuticals could make my blood boil. I should take my avapro. Oh, yeah, avapro. 
[00:07:03]


[Cheering and applause] jimmy, could you... Jimmy? Thank you. Regardless, the good people at prescott pharmaceuticals aren't ones to let a medical breakthrough go unexploited. That's why they're proud to introduce our new blood pressure medication, vasca-towel. Simply apply vasca-towel to your front lawn... [Laughter] lay down in the treatment rectangle and soak in the life-healing ultraviolet radiation. Folks... [Cheering and applause] you know vasca-towel's motto: When your moles start changing shape, you know it's working. Just soak in the healing as vasca-towel does its medical magic to keep most but not all bugs from crawling on you. And remember, these aren't just towels we stole from our aunt's linen closet. She said we could have them. Side effects of vasca-towel may include downton abscess, sunny pee and I can't believe it's not bladder. Next up, weight loss. [Vomiting] nation, swimsuit season is right around the corner, and if you're looking to slim down, the best way may be sparking up. 
>> People who smoke marijuana typically have a higher caloric intake, which makes this aspect of the study so surprising. 
>> We have to assume there is some compound that is involved with marijuana smoke that causes an improvement in metabolism. 
>> Stephen: That's right, pot helps you lose weight. 
[00:09:06]


[Cheering and applause] people here are looking to diet. I say we can use this to stem the tide of childhood obesity. Young man, you can have that sundae after you've smoked your vegetables. [Applause] nation, if pot is a gateway to eating more calories yet somehow still ending up skinnier, it stands to reason that even harder drugs will help even more. That's why prescott pharmaceuticals is proud to introduce vasca-meth. Vasca-meth precision cooked in prescott's state-of-the-art room above the garage, vasca-meth is guaranteed to slim you down by helping you shed unwanted tooth weigh. This summer impress all your friends with your new bikini mouth and your wash board gums. [Laughter] not only that, but you'll be sure to get your cardio in when you're up until 4:00 a.M. Frantically digging your neighbor's yard for copper wire. Side effects of vasca-meth include brain cramps and space invaders and funky cold angina. Well, that's it for cheating death, brought to you by prescott pharmaceuticals. Remember, we don't test on animals. We make the animals test on each other. Until next time, I'll see you in hell. [Cheering and applause] know forward? Change! We didn't like the shape of chickens, so we changed them to nuggets. And sports drinks were boring, ppso we changed that with mio fit. Ppyou can flavor it your way. Change your sports drink. Change america. 
[00:13:25]


[Cheering and applause] 
>> Stephen: Hey, welcome back, everybody. Thanks so much. Folks, if you watch this show, then you know that I have never been a big fan of information. Scientists say we use only 10% of our brain, but I say stop throwing all those numbers at me. Worst of all, the nosy parkers over at the census bureau are always collecting detailed information about people and businesses. So I was excited to learn that finally someone is trying to stop it. 
>> Republican congressman jeff duncan of south carolina proposed a bill to forbid the u.S. Census bureau from conducting any survey except for a population count. 
>> Hear that, census bureau? Population count only. You have no right to my personal information. That belongs to facebook! [Laughter] jeff duncan knows this is really a private privacy issue, explaining right now the census bureau can ask citizens very invasive questions. If they don't respond, the government shows up at their door and threatens them with a fine. Americans are fed up with these mandatory census bureaus and they're asking us to stop the harassment. Yes! Stop the census bureau harassment. Every few years they show up on our front porch asking for personal information. It's like a drunk ex-boyfriend. Suzanne, who's the new guy you're dating? What's the highest level of education he's completed or is he pacific islander or other? Folks, the government, the government, listen to this, the government says census information is necessary for distribuvernment services, but the real plans for this information are anybody's guess. Or everybody's guess. Because according to reports published in the highly prestigious "the internet," census data could very well be used to make a database of gun owners for confiscation or the direct u.N. Troops where to kick in your door or for something even more sinister, like tracking the corn harvest. Terrifying. It's like that horror movie "aggregate yield of the children of the corn." Besides... 
[00:15:37]


[Cheering and applause] besides, we don't need to count corn. I'm pretty sure at this point monsanto has genetically engineered corn so much it can count itself. But some people out there are not so thrilled about defeating the info-nazis. 
>> Imagine if suddenly these numbers disappeared. 
>> No unemployment rate, no gdp numbers, no economic data at all. 
>> This would make it almost impossible to quantify important economic indicators. 
>> This is how we get all economic data that all market indicators rely on. 
>> Market indicators? Come on. Wall street doesn't run on census data. It runs on something much more powerful 
-- cocaine. Besides, congressman duncan is in favor of some information, saying, "as a former small business owner, I recognize that some economic data gathering is beneficial, however, it should be voluntary, industry-driven and not mandated by the government under penalty of law." Yes, the free market can handle it. And we already have way of determining the unemployment rate, the nielsen ratings for "maury." The u.S. Government should be completely ignorant of everything going on within its borders. After all, what's an i.R.S. Tax form but a wage census. Under household income, I should get to check a box that reads, "let's just say we're comfortable." I mean, what's next? Seriously. If we cross this line,if we cross this rubicon, what is next? Tracking all voters using some kind of sticker? Oh, my god! The point is, this bill may be a tacit rejection of the age of enlightenment, but what's so wrong with the age of endarkenment. May I remind you, if there was no renaissance, there would be no renaissance fairs. New york I don't want a turkey leg. We'll be right back. 
[00:21:38]



>> Welcome back, everybody.. My guest tonight is harvard professor. His new book is called "cool war." It's like the cold war, but everyone is wearing skinny jeans. Please welcome noah feldman. [Cheering and applause] hey, nice to see you. Thanks for coming back, dr. Feldman. 
>> Thank you for having me. 
>> Stephen: Now, for the people who may not remember the last time you were here, about five years ago, let's say, thanks for coming back. You're the beemisprofessor of international law, a harvard rhodes scholar. Must have some elastic in your old smarty pants over there, maybe an escalator your ivory tower. All right, your new book is called "the cool war: The future of global competition." What's the cool war? We had a cold war, we kicked as, we took name, we won it. What's the cool war? 
>> In a cold war, you can't attack your enemy because you're afraid you'll each blow each other. In a cool war, you need your enemy. You're completely interdependent. We need china to keep lending us money. 
>> So china is the enemy in the cool war? 
>> It is. They need us as much to keep on buying their products some we're totally interdependent. At the same time, they are rising fast, and that would like to be a global superpower, and we're the only global superpower, and we do not want somebody else to join us at the top. That's a recipe for conflict. 
>> Stephen: After I saw those 2008 games in beijing, scared the... [Laughter] ...The hoy sin sauce out of me. Should I be scared of china? 
>> Yes, you should be scared. I'm scared. 
>> Stephen: You're scared of china? 
>> I am scared. 
>> Stephen: What scares you? What are they going to do to us? 
>> What scares me is they would very credibly like to become the most important power in asia, half the world's population. 
>> 
>> Stephen: How are they not? 
>> We're still the most important power in asia. 
>> Stephen: Oh, wow. One for us. I didn't know that. I like that. 
[00:23:38]



>> We're still the one who have the aircraft carriers. We organize regional security, but they would like the change all this. The way to do that is keep on growing and grow their military at 10% a year, which they've been doing, and to wait until a day comes when they say, gee, we would like taiwan to be part of china and we say, okay, what are we going to do about that? 
>> Stephen: What do we say now? Now we say, we'd rather not talk about it, right? 
>> Yeah. We have what we call a posse of strategic ambiguity. We haven't said we are going to war. We haven't said we won't go to war. The idea is that will stop china from trying to take over taiwan. So far it's worked. 
>> Stephen: Okay. 
>> So for what that's worth, it hasn't happened. The question is how long will that realistically last? 
>> Stephen: How long will that realistically last? That was actually my next question. 
>> I think it will last until china's military... 
>> Stephen: Give me a did a, daddy-o. Grow a pair. What date does it end? 30 years, how long? 
>> If we continue to struggle against china, it may never happen. We're trying to stop that from happening. 
>> Stephen: What is this struggle. You say it's codependence. We know they're our big trading partner. What do we need for them? 
>> We need them to loan us money. They own 8% of our national debt, which is more than anybody in the u.S. 
>> Stephen: Brazil owns a ton of our debt. England owns a ton of our debt. 
>> Not even close. 
>> Stephen: I'm going to call bull [bleeped] on that. I think brazil owns a bunch too. Can someone check to see if I'm right? They said I'm right. [Laughter] wait a second. No, no, listen, listen, you're the harvard guy, I'll give you that one. Let me ask you this, as a kid, and howl are you? 43. 
>> Stephen: Yeah, as a kid, growing up, we're never going to get off our dependence on foreign oil, right, we'll be slaves and chains. They're going to own our women and their harems in saudi arabia because we'll need their oil. Now we're fracking north dakota. We got more oil than we know what to do with in the future. There's plenty of oil out there. We can sell this to other people. Is there anyway we can frack our economy and no longer be dependent on the chinese and we flip the script and china is dependent upon us for sales, but we don't need their cash, game over. 
[00:26:02]



>> It's a great plan. 
>> Stephen: Thank you. [Cheering and applause] 
>> but what I think is that in the real world that would mean we would borrow even more of our own money. We would own even more of our own debt. 
>> Stephen: Who wins? Look into your crystal ball. Who wins this one? 
>> We don't know who wins. 
>> Stephen: America wins. The answer is america wins. How do we win? If that's not your answer, then think about that one. How do we win it? 
>> The way we win and the way everyone could really win would be to take advantage of the fact that we're mutually interdependent and try to use the leverage of the fact that everyone would lose in a war to try to stop them from fighting us and stop us from fighting them. 
>> Stephen: That's what the french said to the nazis over vichy. They said, "we will cooperate with you." 
>> The major difference is that china is knotts easy germany 
-- nazi germany. China is authoritarian. It's not a dictatorship. They change their leadership every ten years. 
>> They're commies. 
>> They were once commies. 
>> Stephen: You're buying that? You swallowed that whole, we're not commies thing. 
>> They're definitely a ruling party. 
>> Stephen: It's called the communist party. 
>> But they've admitted capitalists to membership. 
>> They're just capitalists period. 
>> They seem to be all in on the capitalism front. 
>> All right. Listen, will you come back if we get to war with china? 
>> That would be the least of our problems. I'll be here. 
>> Stephen: Thank you. Thank you so much. Noah feldman. The book is "the cool war."

=======================================================

24 hours ago, life in moore, oklahoma, was monday business as usual. Strong storms were in the are but then at 3:40 eastern, everything changed. Tornado warning issued, residents ran for cover in a town all too familiar with tornadoes and then touchdown. We're watching more severe weather this afternoon in tornado alley. As of now, nothing expected as destructive and terrifying as what we experienced monday. Moore, oklahoma, bore the brunt of it. Entire neighborhoods flattened, brick homes demolished. A hospital and schools destroyed. The official death toll is at 24 but is expected to rise. The governor describing it as a two-mile wide lawer blade going over the community. They had their chopper up. It was on the ground for 40 terrifying minutes, clearing a 20-mile-long path of destruction. The debris ball was two miles in diameter, carrying debris 100 miles outside of moore. We sped up the video. Take a look. 
>> An eerily similar tornado DESTROYED THE TOWN ON MAY 3rd, 1999. That one was an ef-5 tornado. Part of an outbreak that clocked the strongest winds ever recorded on the planet. It killed 36, left 580 hurt and destroyed nearly 5,000 homes and businesses. This time experts fear the damage footprint is twice as large. Here's the 1999 path, and here's yesterday's. You can see the town of moore smack in the middle. The oklahoman ran this headline this morning, worse than may 3rd, THE MONSTER RETURNED. The article then captured the worst fear of any parent, the day ended with ultimate horror, where are the children? 
[00:02:18]



>> It's the most heart breaking part of the story, teachers racing to save their children. At least nine children among the dead. Most killed as their brick and concrete school no match for the winds. This is what the tower plaza elementary school looked like until 3:00 p.M. Yesterday. President obama again leading the nation in its grief. 
>> Among the victims were young children. Trying to take shelter in the safest place they knew, their school. Our prayers are with the people of oklahoma today. Our gratitude is with the teachers who gave their all to shield their children, with the neighbors, first responders and emergency personnel who raced to help as soon as the tornado passed, and with all of those who as darkness fell, searched forser vivers through the night. 
>> As the president mentioned, there are signs of hope as rescuers dig through the wreckage. They're hopeful survivors made it to underground shelters but are blocked by debris. More than 100 people pulled out alive. Stories of families reuniting, neighbors helping neighbors. Strangers helping strangers, and hope triumphing over anything mother nature can dish t. You have been on the ground talking with survivors. What's the latest? 
>> Hi, good afternoon. We have been on the ground since early this morning. And we're on the corner of southwest 6th and telephone road. You'll hear that a lots in press conferences, talk of telephone road. That's right across the street from the new hospital that was destroyed and also right behind me is a stretch of homes in this residential suburban neighborhood that was completely razed, flattened as if it never existed except for the piles of rubble you see behind me. Earlier today, it was sunny and just briefly, but enough for people to emerge and come back to their homes to start digging through their favorite things. Trying to retrieve anything that could have survived yesterday's tornado. And some people did walk away with a few things. Other people just stayed around their property, started to build piles of bricks and condense the mess. Across the street, we have homes that have fared a little better. They're torn up, but some still have their roofs on. We have seen people show up with plywood and tarps. That's one thing we have been battling through the late morning and into the afternoon, these wind bands coming through, bringing a lot of rain. There was a prediction there could be hail involved. We haven't seen any of that, but there was very heavy rain. I'm seeing now to my left, so if I look distracted, the first crew, hazmat crew on the scene. I don't know if we can pan over here, because they have hazmat gear on, but they have also got their service dogs that they're using because today we have smelled a lot of gas in the area. We were warned early this morning by police about gas in the area. And to stay put, not to do a lot of roaming around. We have done that, but you can see they have come out with a big team that arrived on the corner. They also sent some crews down the street a moment ago as well. This is the first main group of hazmat officials and fire first responders we have seen on this corner today. As I pointed out earlier, the fact that there were so many more people here as they were going through things when the rain picked up. Then they went for cover once again because they have been wet and in harm's way for long enough. So most people that were out here then left once again. But you can see they're taking the dogs through what used to be the kitchen. Looking for anything that the dog might deem to be suspicious as well as the first responders going through the crowd as well. You can see further down the field there, there are some people out there with metal detectors that are searching for some of their things. The cars you see that are littered, literally just littered throughout the land here, makes you think and makes you realize the power of this storm. I knowou were talking about the 1999 storm. And I think you showed the comparable track for what the storm in '99 did and what the storm here yesterday did. And they are so very similar. That storm, as you point out, more than 40 people who lost their lives. So far, we only have the confirmation of 24 deaths. But we do suspect that to go up. As we're getting the breakdown of this, they attribute those 20 deaths here in moore. They attribute four of those deaths in oklahoma city. But the really disturbing part, the really upsetting part about the deaths is nine of them are the kids. They were able to find and pull out seven kids from plaza tower elementary school. There still remains a search at that school. They haven't given up hope, and we heard that earlier today in the press conference as well. It does remain a hopeful search and rescue, that they will continue to search for people. We don't have a total tally on numbers of people who might be missing. We're trying to work on that, but earlier, you'll recall the number was much higher last night and earlier this morning as well about what the death toll might be, but that was revised later today and they have been sticking to 24 for the last several hours. 
[00:07:37]



>> All right, thomas, thanks so much and stay safe. 
>> Thank you. 
>> More severe weather is in store, this time texas is in the crosshairs. There's tornado watch up for the dallas area through 7:00 tonight. Nbc meteorologist dylan dryer is all over it for us. What have you got? 
>> Well, we're going to see the potential of another round of tornadoes today. With that tornado watch issued across parts of texas, the moisture continues to stream in off the gulf of mexico. It makes a very unstable air mass, and once you had that daytime heating, there was sun earlier this morning. It makes it this time of day where we could see our strongest storms. Now, until early this evening. So that's why we will keep an eye on the storms as they fire up. Look at dallas right now. About to get just downpoured on as those storms continue to move eastward. The heavy storms continue into eastern oklahoma and moving through central arkansas right now as well. It's all out ahead of this cold front, and the problem with the situation we're in right now is it's a very slow-moving cold front. So we've had flood watches and warnings in effect, in addition to the severe weather because the storms are really going nowhere fast. And you can see that we do have those tornado watches now stretching into northwestern louisiana, into southwestern arkansas. The yellow boxes that aren't shaded in indicate severe thunderstorm watches, and a watch means that conditions are favorable for either a thunderstorm or a tornado to occur. The filled in boxes, that's right over dallas, those are your severe thunderstorm warnings. A warning means that severe thunderstorm is occurring at this time. We could see wind gusts up to 60 miles per hour. Those would be straight-line wind gusts. As soon as you get a tornado warning, that means a tornado has either been spotted on radar or on the ground. We're going to keep an eye on the area where the tornado watch is located in case any of those storms, thosupercell do produce tornadoes which is possible over the course of this afternoon and the evening. That red area over northwestern louisiana, southwestern arkansas, and texas where we could see the strongest storms today. 
[00:09:46]



>> Dylan, I know you understand the science behind this. Can you help us understand when we have a two-mile-wide tornado with record winds and 
-- how is this sort of weather event created? 
>> You know, it's one of those things where a category 4 or 5 hurricane isn't likely, but it happens. And you need just the right conditions for it to happen. So while this is very unusual storm, especially since it's occurring in an area it occurred in 1999. The conditions are just right, moisture coming in off the gulf of mexico. That makes an unstable air mass. A cold front which is kind of your trigger mechanism that helps the storms fire up, and dry, cool air behind it, it's the clash of warm humid air and the cold dry air that fires up the storms. That's why it's called a front, because that's where the actual storms do occur. But then you add any kind of rotation, and you're looking at the possibility of a tornado. This area's tornado alley for a reason. However, you get these record-breaking storms. They don't happen often, but it's an area where they certainly could happen if just the right conditions occur, and unfortunely, that's exactly what we saw yesterday in oklahoma. And something we'll keep an eye out today across texas. 
>> Very interesting. Thank you very much. Dylan, we'll have more from you later as the storms develop. Right now, the president is receiving updates throughout the day at the white house. He's also pledging the country's support to moore for as long as it takes. 
>> As a nation, our full folk right now is on the urgent work of rescue and the hard work of recovery and rebuilding that lies ahead. Oklahoma needs to get everything that it needs right away. Americans from every corner of this country will be right there with them, opening our homes, our hearts to those in need. Because we're a nation that stands with our fellow citizens as long as it takes. 
>> Nbc's kristen welker is live on the north lawn for us. Do you think the president is going to travel to moore? 
>> I would be surprised if president obama doesn't travel to moore, although the white house hasn't announced any plans to do so at this point in time. But of course, this is the response that we have seen from him in the past in responding to other national disasters including the boston bombings well as the plant fire in west texas, just to name two examples. The president sort of assumes the role of comforter in chief in these instances. So I would be surprised if we didn't see him make the trip there. In the meantime, he is fulfilling that role by reachg out to state and local officials. Last evening, he called the governor of oklahoma, mary fallin, andfered his condolences and also offered the full weight and resources of the federal government. We heard him strike a similar tone when he addressed the nation earlier today. Take a listen to a little more of what president obama had to say. 
[00:12:37]



>> There are empty spaces where there used to be living rooms and bedrooms and classrooms. And in time, we're going to need to refill those spaces with love and laughter and community. If there's hope to hold on to, not just in oklahoma but around the country, it's the knowledge that the good people there and in oklahoma are better prepared for this type of storm than most. Our prayers are with the people of oklahoma today, and we will back up those prayers with deeds for as long as it takes. 
>> Now, president obama has also declared a disaster area in oklahoma. So that means that the five counties that have been hardest hit are eligible to receive federal assistance. So people who have lost their homes, who have lost their businesses, who have lost their belongings can receive federal assistance up to $30,000 per family if they are eligible. Fema officials are on the ground, by the way, right now with ipads, helping people to sign up for that assistance on site. Making it a little bit easier for them to recover in these very difficult hours after the tornado has hit. In addition to that, fema has sent about 150 officials as of this morning. More are of course on the way. There are search and rescue crews there. Also crews there helping with telecommunications, we have reported so much about how difficult it has been for people to contact each other with their cell phones. So there are people there working on that problem specifically. President obama will also be sending a department of homeland security secretary janet napolitano to oklahoma tomorrow. 'Ll be meeting with state and local officials and make sure they're getting the assistance they need and the president continues to get regular updates on the situation as they monitor the devastation out of oklahoma. Back to all of you in the studio. 
>> Kristen, when people look at this kind of devastation, people want to help around the country. The president sent out an e-mail through barackobama.Com today, telling people they could donate directly from his website to the red cross. Is there anything else the president is calling on americans to do if they want to help? 
[00:14:50]



>> Well, I think you hit it right on the head. I think president obama and you also heard fema administrator craig fugate calling on people really to send money right now. That is what people need. That's what that community needs, as they begin what will undoubtedly be a very long recovery process. You look at the pictures and the devastation there, and it's really just stunning to see entire city blocks completely wiped out. So as of this time, that's really what they're stressing, the need to just send money to help with the rebuilding efforts. We should also say that press secretary jay carney did insist today during the briefing that fema does have enough resources right now to help with that federal assistance that I was describing earlier. 
>> All right, we'll be keeping an eye on the white house. Thank you. 
>> Thank you. 
>> Just last hour, oklahoma governor mary fallin and local officials spent an hour answering questions from reporters. Authorities say rescue and recovery is their first priority, calling this the storm of storms. 
>> In the midst of tragedy and loss of life, we have also seen the resilience and the courage and the strength of our people. And we will get through this. We will overcome, and we will rebuild, and we will regain our strength. 
>> This has been quite an experience. I was the actual mayor here in MAY 3rd, 1999, SO THIS IS NOT MY First rodeo with this. But it doesn't get any easier. 
>> We'll be through every damaged piece of property in this city at least three times before we're done, and we hope to be done by dark. 
>> It's unfortunate that we are once again seeing what tornadoes can do. But you're also seeing what the investment in public safety and the commitment and training and exercise does when disaster does strike. 
>> Up next, stories of survival amid the devastation. You're in the cycle for tuesday, MAY 21st. 
>> You can see this, I don't know how to explain it. How to describe it. This is

>> We have a tornado warning that has just been issued. It's in effect until 2:30 central time. You can see it's in the extreme northeastern section right at the tip of that arrow of texas. It's in an area near texarkana and central bowie county in northeast texas. Also south central little river county in southwestern arkansas. This includes the city of simms and new boston. There is the possibility that this storm does have some rotation. You can see a closer look here in northeastern texas where we do have some of the heavier downpours and there is the possibility that some rotation has either been noticed on the radar itself or on the ground. A tornado has been spotted. So a warning means the conditions are now to the point where a tornado has developed. So that's certainly an area we'll keep an eye on. It's in effect for the next ten minutes. 
[00:21:31]



>> Thanks, dylan. 
>> Even seasoned weather forecasters were taken aback by what their encountered on the ground in oklahoma last night. Someone with lots of experience covering severe storms is mike sidell. He joins us with his experience. 
>> Hey, one of the experiences we just missed on camera, some local officials were in here, fire department, search and recovery officials were in here and they found a cat back here. We have been here for several hours. We didn't even hear the cat making any noise, but they dug through the rubble and the cat is okay. But boy, it's covered in mud and debris. Just 
-- it's good to see that we're getting in here, getting the pets. They're coming through the rubble, even here with cadaver dogs seeing if there's anything left they can save. Generally we're talking about pets. Here's another story. These bathtubs have been places a lot of people ended up. There's not a lot of basements here. Husband and wife in this home, it's gone. The husband threw the wife in the bathtub, landed on top of her. As the tornado came through from the south and west. Winds 190 miles per hour is the preliminary peak estimate, as the tornado clears the area, the wife looks up, the husband is gone. He gets sucked up by the tornado and ends up out here in the muddy field. They found him alive. He's in the hospital, she's okay, but just one of the many harrowing stories out here. As this massive tornado came through here. All you see are foundations. We have had thunderstorms. Now the rain is over with, and we expect things to clear up now. The sun will be out later on this afternoon through tonight. So just piles of debris, and back there is where that 7-eleven store was. If you came ornd the corner, didn't live here, weren't from moore, you wouldn't know it was back there. And in the foreground, you can see vehicles which were picked up and blown. That's about 75 to 100 yards over there, and upside down. Just the force of this wind with this deadly tornado. So a lot of cleanup to continue. This is going to be much like joplin, much like I saw here back in 1999. It's going to take weeks and months first to get the debris out and then to rebuild, but as we know moore is very resilient. They had the f-5 in 1999. Then they had the f-4 in 2003. So they've had three violent tornadoes in 14 years. The odds of that in one town are staggering. 
[00:23:58]



>> Mike, it's s.E. Now. If you live in louisiana, you're taught what to do about hurricanes. Maybe if you live in california, you're taught what to do in wildfires. If you live in oklahoma, they tell you what to do, and maybe getting in a bathtub is one of the things they tell you to do in the case of a tornado. What other kinds of things are the residents of moore, oklahoma, preparing to do as the tornado was rolling in? 
>> Yeah, first of all, there was plenty of warning, a watch out. They had about a half-hour warning on this tornado because it came in fnew castle. The problem with a tornado like this, ef-4 or 5 is about the only place you can be that is really safe is underground in a shelter or basement. Most of these homes don't have basements so what we tell people to do is go to the interior most room and cover yourself up with something like a mattress, and a lot of folks got in these tubs and these bathrooms avd covered themselves up. In some cases, a mom on top of her kids or a teacher on top of the kids. Bottom line, when you have a tornado like this with winds upwards of 200 miles per hour, unless you're underground, if you come through this alive and not seriously injured, you have to consider yourself very, very lucky. 
>> Mike, thank you. 
>>> Two schools were directly in the palthtornado. A psychologi who has worked with the survivors of sandy and the newtown shooting joins us to talk about how students are coping with this disaster. That's next. 
>> We had to pull a car out of the front hallway off a teacher, and she 
-- I don't know what that lady's name is but she had three little kids underneath her. Good job, teach. You could see it ripped our house up. I still have a little girl buried there, so man, I gotta go. ??? i ' hard ??? ??? I'm a hard, hard worker and I'm working every day. ??? ??? I'm a hard, hard worker and I'm saving all my pay. ??? ??? if I ever get some money put away, ??? ??? I'm going to take it all out and celebrate. ??? ???

[00:28:59]



>>> We are back now with our continuing coverage of the tragedy in oklahoma. The official death toll now stands at 24. We have seen that number change several times over the past day. Let's get you another update now from the middle of it all. Chris janansing is in moore, oklahoma. Chris, what can you tell us? 
>> Well, we have just seen over the last half hour, the rescue efforts continue here. You can see the absolute devastation behind me. And groups of men in yellow coats came and started walking down this block that has been absolutely wiped out. Across the street, there are homes that are at least partially still standing. And we saw that yesterday they PUT LARGE Xs IN ORANGE PAINT ON Them. Today, I don't know if you can see on one of the doors, there's a bright green sticker that says they have gone through it again. They plan to do that three times for all of these homes, and of course, this is just one small section of what's been affected here, but they say they want to make absolutely sure that on the off chance that there may be somebody still trapped who is alive or a body that needs to recover, they want to be able to do that. At the same time, we saw a little bit of activity returning here because there have been some torrential downpours and lightning here, but it's gotten a lot better. Obvious le, the weather is clearing a little bit, and we have seen people coming in and i think you saw some folks at that house, who are looking themselves for whatever they can possibly retrieve. We saw one couple walking with a cart, and they had taken maybe just this much stuff, you know, maybe something that would fit in an 8 by 10 box, that was all they could get out of there. And there were two young guys at the end of the block who had come here for their buddy who said it just was too much for him. He couldn't go himself, and they wanted to see if th]y could find some of his things. He was really upset because his dog had been lost in all this. Well, they heard barking, and the car that was in the driveway had been buried under bricked that had flown off the facade of the house, and there was the dog, cowering, but okay. So they have his dog, and they also have some of his belongings and they're going to be bringing them back to his buddy. 
[00:31:12]



>> And chris, one of the things that strikes me is, you know, you have people's whole lives sort of streen out across this area, very invasive, very personal. How are residents dealing with that intrusive nature of having your whole life, all your things, all your possessions jumbled up and on the lawn for people to see? 
>> Several have said to me they admit they're in a state of shock. Having said that, this is 
-- excuse me, a very tight knit community that has lost at least 24 people, nine of them children, and so what you hear time and time and time again is, I survived. My family survived. And this is just stuff. Having said that, when they found their dog or they found a photograph album that, you know, predigital days, those are pictures they could never get back, it is a little feeling of happiness, but this community has come together remarkably, and it really does give you a sense of perspective about what is important in life. We have heard that time and time and time again from people who you would think would be just broken apart because they seem to have lost everything, but they say they have been able to keep what's really important. 
>> Chris jansing, thanks for all your work on the ground there. 
>>> Crews continue to sift carefully through the rubble of two elementary schools destroyed by the mile-wide tornado. Meantime, mobile mental health counseling centers are being set up in the area. As more stories emerge from the youngest survivors and the teachers who put themselves in harm's way to protect them. 
>> I had to hold on to the wall to keep myself safe because i didn't want to fly away in the tornado. 
>> A light went down and hit me in the head. And all the other girls were screaming and they were crying. 
>> I was on top of six kids. 
>> On top of six children? 
>> Yeah, lying on top of them. 
>> And they're all okay. 
[00:33:13]



>> All of mine are okay. 
>> She is a sixth grade teacher at what was plaza towers elementary. This morning, she was reunited with one of the kids she shielded with her own body. 
>> I have a student who wants to say thank you to you. This is damian klein, and his mom brandy. 
>> I told you you were going to be okay. How's bobby? 
>> I want to bring you all in here. I got a group hug. 
>> He was scared. I said I won't leave you, i promise. 
>> Damian, how does it feel to see this teacher? You told me earlier she saved your life? 
>> Good. 
>> A hug feel pretty good? 
>> So how do kids like damian move on after being part of something so scary? Dr. Rachel busman is a clinical psychologist for the child mind institute. She's worked in the field for trauma response following hurricane sandy and the newtown tragedy. What kinds of things did these kids see in moore, oklahoma, and what kinds of help are they going to need to deal with that? 
>> The children are really seeing a variety of things. And some very scary images. And what we're seeing mental health providers doing right now in their emergency response is providing what's called psychological fit aid, really trying to alleviate the immediate distress and focus on insuring physical safety needs. 
>> What about parents? I know a lot of these parents are going through a traumatic situation, not just with their homes being destroyed but maybe their families being broken now, or maybe having the fear for a certain period of time that their kids were gone or they didn't knowhere their kids were? What do you need to do psychologically for those parents? 
[00:35:13]



>> It's a great question because parents right now need to do several things, and one of them is really take care of their own needs. We think about the airplane and the idea you put an oxygen mask on yourself before helping another person. So we really want to make sure we're providing support to parents so that they can be adequate supports to their kids. And then as far as how they can help their children, right now, we really want to establish a sense of safety for the kids. And let them know that we can take care of them, and that means a lot of things including limiting media exposure and trying to keep as much routine as possible. And just reassuring them that they're safe. 
>> And doctor, what's sort of a long-term mental impact do we fear these children may suffer from, and going back to the parents, what should parents be looking for down the road as signs that their children are still struggling to deal with this incident? 
>> Right, these are great questions. I think right now, we really can't speculate about the long-term impact for kids. A lot of kids are very resilient and not all traumatic events mean someone's going to have long-term problems with recovery. But we do want to let parents know that it's completely normal to expect a variety of reactions during such an event. And kids may be more clingy, they may be more irritable, they clearly could be distressed or scared, and all these things are normal in the wake of a tragedy, and that we want parents to remain calm, as calm as possible, and really one of the best things a parent can do is accept support from other people in the community. We see that this is a really very tight-knit community, and those who haven't been directly impacted, I'm sure, are going to be providing support to parents, and they should take that support. 
>> And doctor, I don't know if there's a good answer to this question. We have been looking at a couple tragedies that have affected communities and children in those communities, from newtown to cleveland to this natural disaster. Do you advice people to talk about the nature of the crisis that faces a given community depending on the age of the child? Is there a difference between talking about bad people or evil versus the idea that some things are unexpected and acts of god depending on your world view? How do you advise people get into that? 
[00:37:25]



>> That's another really good question that I don't know there's one answer to, but kids will ask questions and we want to provide them with brief, factual information that's really geared toward their age group. A younger child might want to know, are their belongings safe or is their home still standing? Older kids like teenagers might be asking more specific questions or about specific people. And I think the real take-home point regardless of what the tragedy is is to provide factual information, brief information, because kids can just take in bits of information at one time, and also to let kids ask the questions first and not lead with what we think might be what's on their mind. So saying, do you have any questions? And also, you don't have to have every answer, so a child might ask a question and you say, that's a really good question, and I want to answer. I'm going to find out the answer and get back to you. 
>> Doctor, good advice. Thank you. As we heard from dylan another line of dangerous weather is moving through the region. Storm chaser reed timmer is on the ground and we'll hear from him next as we take a quick break, a scene of relief and emotion monday as 
-- today, as parents reunited with their students at briarwood elementary. lisa, quit. I honestly loved smoking, and I honestly didn't think I would ever quit. 
[00:39:33]



[ Male Announcer ] ALONG WITH SUPPORT, Chantix (varenicline) is proven to help people quit smoking. It reduces the urge to smoke. It put me at ease that you could smoke on the first week. 
[ Male Announcer ] SOME PEOPLE HAD CHANGES In behavior, thinking or mood, hostility, agitation, depressed mood and suicidal thoughts or actions while taking or after stopping chantix. If you notice any of these stop taking chantix and call your doctor right away. Tell your doctor about any history of depression or other mental health problems, which could get worse while taking chantix. Don't take chantix if you've had a serious allergic or skin reaction to it. If you develop these stop taking chantix and see your doctor right away as some can be life-threatening. Tell your doctor if you have a history of heart or blood vessel problems, or if you develop new or worse symptoms. Get medical help right away if you have symptoms of a heart attack or stroke. Use caution when driving or operating machinery. Common side effects include nausea, trouble sleeping and unusual dreams. With chantix and with the support system it worked for me. 
[ Male Announcer ] ASK YOUR DOCTOR IF CHANTIX Is right for you. ?????? ?????? constipated? Yeah. Mm. SOME LAXATIVES LIKE Dulcolax CAN CAUSE CRAMPS. BUT Phillips' Caplets DON'T. They have magnesium. For effective relief of occasional constipation. Thanks.

>>> Breaking news from the nbc weather team. Severe storms, some capable of producing tornadoes, are threatening areas across texas, oklahoma,louisiana, and arkansas. Let's get right back to meteorologist dylan dreyer for the latest. 
>> This is a slow moving system, that's why it's in the same area we saw yesterday. We're seeing the most severe storms right now still across oklahoma, especially down into texas where we did have a tornado warning about five minutes ago in northeastern texas. That has since expired, but we do still have several tornado watches, also severe thunderstorm warnings and watches all out ahead of this cold front that again is extremely slow-moving. So we're going to we keeping an eye on these storms throughout the rest of the afternoon. Now is the time of day where these storms do continue to strengthen and fire up. The dark shade in yellow is an area where we do have severe thunderstorm warnings at this time across parts of oklahoma and texas. Could see gusts up to 60 miles per hour, torrential downpours and quarter-sized hail. We'll keep an eye on those. 
>> Thanks again. 
>>> And storm chaser reed timmer is racing into that next line of storms right now. He joins us by phone from just north of dallas. Reed, tell us what do you have your eye on? What are you chasing right now? 
>> Well, we're going through dallas right now, and it looks like heavy rain and strong straight-line winds, so the dfw area, out ahead of this line, there is a potential. And there's a tornado warning that started a few minutes ago. We're headed down toward corsicana, east of waco. That's where we expect the highest tornado threat this afternoon. And we have been storm chasing the last three ys. We have our armored research vehicles that are designed to drive into the tornadoes, and actually, the day before yesterday's tragic ef-5 tornado in moore, oklahoma, that missed my house by a few miles, we intercepted a tornado just east of edmond, on the east side of oklahoma city. 
[00:44:12]



>> This is a really serious situation, obviously, laults of people dead in oklahoma, and i don't want anyone out there to think you're doing this storm chasing for some sort of thrill seeking. There is a real important value to your work, isn't there? 
>> Oh, definitely. Storm chasers, our number one priority is to provide the ground work underneath the storm, and kfor out of oklahoma city, chopper 4, and also a team of storm chasers on the ground covering that dev stating ef-4, possibly ef-5 tornado that went through moore yesterday. From the second it touched down, keeping people warned. And you know, if those people didn't know that tornado was coming, the death toll could have been worse. But we were on storms further south yesterday and it had tornado warnings. When we heard reports of fatalities coming in, schools getting hit, it made us sick to our stomach, and the whole vehicle was silent for hours, for the rest of the chase, and we were trying to get ahold of friends and family. A friends of mine is a teacher at an elementary school. The storm is coming. Get all your students, every car you have, drive path, get out of the path, she said, no, I have to stay here with my kids. And she rode 
-- I didn't hear from her for a couple more 
-- probably several hours and I got a text back saying we're fine. That was a really scary moment, and just a horrible, horrible tragedy. And yeah, storm chasers, if you don't know how the storm faces, it can be deadly and it's not a thrill seeking mission. We're out here try to keep people warned and we have armored vehicles for research purposes. 
>> Keep chasing and stay safe at the same time. Thank you very much. Hour to hour, we're getting new information about the scope of the tragedy in moore. This is still very much an unfolding news event, but it's very likely that ultimately this will be one of the five most damaging tornadoes, and in history, ironically, moore already was on the list as having experienced the fourth COSTLIEST TORNADO ON MAY 3rd, 1999. The bridge creek, moore, twister, that day killed 36 people and injured 583. Damaged thousands of homes, businesses, and public buildings. Melissa ray burger covered that devastating tornado 14 years ago. She joins us now to give us some historical context. 
[00:46:38]



>> You know, for all of us who were there then and are looking at this now, the irony is shocking. I think most of us are left speechless that it hit ultimately in the same place, in prablthically the same neighborhoods in moore, oklahoma. And the pictures that I'm seeing on tv are exactly what I walked through back then. I remember the eerie silence that people were mentioning this morning, in a normally bustling neighborhood, the quiet itself made you feel cold, it was so scary. I'm from the east coast. All I knew about tornadoes then were what I had seen in movies, and I didn't know what to expect when I walked out into the rubble. I expected to see damage. I did not expect things to look like somebody had put the entire town of more into a blender because all of the pieces were so small, you couldn't tell what they had once been or where they had come from. So this is very bitter irony for anyone who had been there then and is there now. 
>> Milissa rehberger, thank you. While we're devastated by the stories of the lives lost in yesterday's tornado, we're heartened by stories of survival pouring in from the ravaged communities from families in shelters to teachers using their bodies to shield their students. Joining the chorus of support is country music star and native oklahoman toby keith who released this statement on twitter. This storm has devastated the community that I grew up in. I rode my bike through those neighborhoods. I have family and friends in moore. My heart and prayers go out to those who have lost so much, but moore is strong and we will persevere. God be with you all. For more on the survivors and what's being done for them on the ground in texas, I want to bring in allison, a spokes person for the red cross. In addition to money, what do residents of moore, oklahoma, need most right now? 
>> Well, right now, what they need is they need their immediate needs met, which is food, clothing, and shelter, which is what we're providing to them or trying to provide to them right now. Money directly, does that help them? I'm sure it would, but right now, their immediate needs are food, clothing, shelter, emotional, and mental support. And we're providing that through our shelters and through people on the ground. 
[00:48:49]



>> Yeah, we have 20,000 people displaced and without homes. What are we doing for them? What are you doing for them? Are you setting up shelters for them? Where are they going to sleep? 
>> We have shelters that, you know, have accommodations for them to sleep. We will accommodate all of the people who do need that. If we need to open up more shelters, we'll open up more shelters, but you know, we are definitely prepared to meet the needs of the community. And set up what we need to to help everyone. 
>> And allison, we heard reports that cell phone service is either difficult or nonexistent. Obviously, no electricity, no clean water, even. How do those lack of necessities complicate your efforts on the ground there? 
>> Well, you know, I don't know how much it's complicating our efforts. I know it's complicating the efforts of the people who live here. And you know, with no cell phone service, it's hard. It's hard to contact your loved ones. We have set up a service online called safe and well, where you can list yourself as safe and well, and your loved ones can find you. That's one way of communication that we try to provide that may help people here on the ground. But for us,know, we're just trying to do the best we can to bring our services to everyone. 
>> I'm curious about the medical situation. I know that some of the local hospitals, I guess, I have to ask, are some of the local hospitals also among the destroyed? So how are you dealing with that? 
>> You know what, I don't have any information on the medical facilities right now. I do know what we're providing, but as far as the medical community, I'm not sure of how that's being handled at the moment. 
>> Okay, allison. Thanks for joining us. 
>>> Today in a sign of unity with those in oklahoma, the president ordered all flags lowered to half-staff and the senate held a moment of silence. 
>> Under the previous order, there will now be a moment of silence for the victims of the tornadoes in oklahoma. ????????????

>>> There is also developing news I the jodi arias trial this afternoon. It's up to the jury whether she lives or dies. And arias took the stand and begged for her life during the final phase of the trial that has consumed the nation. Nbc's diana alvear is live outside the courthouse in phoenix. Diana, it was something, perhaps, fascinating to watch the woman who previously said that she wants to die now saying there's no reasons why I should live. 
>> Reporter: Exactly right, toure. This was not defiant jodi arias. This was pentitent jody air whereas. She begged the jury to spare her life, so she could spare anyone nr more pain. She finally admitted, this is the greatest mistake of my life, I can't believe I'm capable of this orrifying violence, saying she didn't kill spiders up until 2008. She talked about her artwork, how she would never get to be a mother. She tried to humanize to t jury, I'm not this horrible person. If you spare my life, I can contribute to society. That's how she described her turnaround to wanting the death penalty a couple years ago to now wanting her life spared. She said she could contribute in meaningful ways. Let's listen to what she had to say. 
>> I made many public statements that I would prefer the death penalty to life in prison. Each time I said that, though i meant it, I lacked perspective. Until very recently, I could not have imagined standing before you all and asking you all to give me life. To me, life in prison was the most unappealing outcome I could possibly think of. I thought I'd rather die. But as I stand here now, I can't in good conscience ask you to sentence me to death because of them. Asking for death is tantamount to suicide. Either way, I'm going to spend the rest of my life in prison. 
[00:56:35]



>> Reporter: She also said that if they spare her life, she can teach her fellow inmates to speak spanish and read and write and she'd donate her hair to locks of love. Toure? 
>> Okay. Diana alvear. Thanks. have stiffness... Accomplishing even little things can become major victories. I'm phil mickelson, pro golfer. When I was diagnosed with psoriatic arthritis, my rheumatologist prescribed enbrel for my pain and stiffness, and to help stop joint damage. 
[ Male Announcer ] ENBREL MAY LOWER YOUR Ability to fight infections. Serious, sometimes fatal events including infections, tuberculosis, lymphoma, other cancers, nervous system and blood disorders, and allergic reactions have occurred. Before starting enbrel, your doctor should test you for tuberculosis and discuss whether you've been to a region where certain fungal infections are common. You should not start enbrel if you have an infection like the flu. Tell your doctor if you're prone to infections, have cuts or sores, have had hepatitis b, have been treated for heart failure, or if you have symptoms such as persistent fever, bruising, bleeding, or paleness. Since enbrel helped relieve my joint pain, it's the little things that mean the most. Ask your rheumatologist if enbrel is right for you.

=======================================================

From comedy central's world news headquarters in new york, this is the the "daily show" with jon stewart. 
( Cheers and applause ) Captioning sponsored by Comedy central 
>> Jon: Welcome to the the "daily show." High name is jon stewart. We have a good show for you tonight. Our guest, paying will be joining us. 
( Cheers and applause ). She's, you know, obviously he is the host of the popular show "ellen." 
( Laughter ) let's get to our top story tonight as though we were a news organization. 
( Laughter ) the obama administration in crisis mode. Hurricane sandy still swirling. The i.R.S., The ap, the benghazi e-mails, joe biden's spring break. Oh! It's time for-- that's not even photoshopped 
( laughter ) it is time for some damage control, which is why yesterday the administration sent out whoever this guy is. 
( Laughter ) to put out the fire. 
>> But you didn't know what the i.R.S. Was up to. 
>> Norshould we. As I said, there is-- the i.R.S. Is an agency that has a-- has a historical independence. For very good reasons in this town, we-- the-- the white house and stays as far away from the i.R.S. And lets them do their business. The cardinal rule is you don't get involved in an independent investigation. 
>> Jon: You sweet, sweet boy. 
( Laughter ) I know the cardinal rule is you don't get involved, but the problem here is the gap between involved in and aware of. It's like your kids want to make dinner for you. You don't have to be involved. But you should be aware that they're doing it. 
( Laughter ) or you get stuck explaining why your houseburned down. And-- 
[00:02:01]



( laughter ) can I say something. My favorite part of that, the kids, even when the house is on fire. They don't lose their smile. "Oh, there's a fire..." By the way, we weren't the only ones who wondered why the obama administration sent out kevin a older brother from "home alone." 
>> I mean, this is no disrespect to you. Why are you here today? Why isn't the white house chief of staff here to tell us what happened? 
>> Displ why am I here instead of the white house chief of staff? I don't know. He thought this would be funnier? I don't know. Young guy who really doesn't know answering questions. Not that having actual explanations for the scandal would have even mattered. 
>> This is just rotten to the core. This is arrogance. This is big government cronyism. 
>> Nanny state is here to tell us all what to do, and if we start criticizing, you get targeted. 
>> All three of these scandals makes a cluster that implies some very bad things. 
>> Literally, the decisions of our life and death may very well be in the hands of the i.R.S. 
>> I don't think we know what the facts are. 
( Laughter ). 
>> Jon: You missed last bit. Play the last bit again. Just give them the last bit again. They missed the last thing because they were laughing at michelle bachman because she's 
( bleep ) insane. 
>> I don't think we know what the facts are. 
( Laughter ). 
>> Jon:-- HERE'S WHAT I Know-- I i said, life and death. Arrogant cluster... Life or death. The facts are 
( bleep ). Un. . Un yes, the administration's lack of transparency is equal only to the republicans', as of now, fact-free, bone-deep certainty and contempt. And this, my friend. 
[00:04:10]



>> Abc news trumpeted an exclusive story that purported to reveal e-mails proving that the white house had meddled with the beg talking points last september. 
>> Part of his story turned out to have been based on an inaccurate summary of e-mails that made things look worse for the white house. 
( Laughter ). 
>> Jon: Can anybody do their jobs in that town. ?O now even the president is messing up. We found an e-mail where the state department said they wanted to edit it to reflect political concerns. Oh, look, it's a groupon. M sorry. It's becoming very clear that nobody really knows enough about these three scandal/issues to make any definitive judgment on them yet. But if it's a scandal you want, it's the scandal we have. In our recurring series about returning iraq and afghanistan veterans and the paperwork quagmire that await them the obama administration made a promise in april of 2009 that they would create a seamless computerized veterans health record system. Costs be damned! Critics said it couldn't be done. Four years and $1 billion later, it turns out, yeah, they were right, it couldn't be done. 
( Laughter ) at least not by the administration. In fact, it so couldn't be done there's still a backlog of claims for 900,000 veterans and paper disability records still undigitized and piled up so high the floor of one va field office is going to collapse. 
( Laughter ) perhaps injuring people who, luckily, would at least have instant access to the proper forms they would need to file the crushed pelvis claims and most likely have the time to fill them out because of how long it will take to dig them out of the rubble. Last month, the house appropriations committee called secretary of defense chuck chuck hagel. 7 hagel. You know, if he married katherine heigl he'd be chuck hagel heigl. Serious. They called chuck haig toll ask since we're not building a new computerized system, which will the two existing systems, alta and vista, from d.O.D. And v.A. Be able to fully talk to each other. 
[00:06:47]



>> What the congress instructed, what the congress funded was a seamless system. We'll have it shortly. Can I tell you in a week or two we will have something decided within 30 days, I'll tell that you. 
>> Jon:30 days! A hard number. Since that interview, 30 days ago he had our chuck hagel advent calendar. I have gone through the whole thing. It is day 30. I've been opening the doors. Let's see what we've got in here a little bit of nice chocolate-- I'm explaining this because we have so many rabbis in the audience tonight. Yeah. 
( Cheers and applause ) I'm trying to explain that christians give chocolate gifts and 
( bleep ) for, like, 30 days straight, even when they're dealing with, like, the crucifixion. It's really just-- it's all about candy. Whereas jews, even when we're freed we're like, "have some bitter herbs." All right. 
( Laughter ) so it's-- finally here. It was 30 days five days ago, so did they have a decision on the interoperability? We asked the house appropriations committee and we called the pentagon. Here's a quick summary of those those calls went. 
>> No. 
>> No. 
>> No, no, no, no, no. 
>> Noooooo! 
>> Jon: Chewy. I guess running a bureaucracy with a single goal is just too complicated. 
>> The obama campaign twice now has been one of the most effecti operations in american history. 
>> Jon: Oh, yeah, that's right. They did run a very effective campaign operation. But we're talking about an online component here, taking two disparate databases and turning them into one gigantic debut. A billion dollars says that's impossible. 
[00:08:51]



>> At obama headquarters what they did finally was unite the databases they'd had from the first campaign, the fund-raising database, the polling database, all into one gigantic database. 
( Laughter ) 
>> Jon: Sure. You can do that when you're paying people with pizza. They can do almost anything. 
( Laughter ) these paper roars at the v.A. Are already completely fragmented. You would need an incredibly sophisticate data mining operations to identify the veterans let alone target them-- role roll the clip. 
>> The obama campaign is widely believe believe to have the most sophisticating mining operation. 
>> They created a holistic system where they could not just target people but figure out the best way to target people. 
>> They compiled information on your buying habits like what magazine you subscribed to, maybe information on where and how you like to travel. 
>> Jon: That's not creepy at all. 
( Laughter ) but, you know, what? These are people that you're trying to give money to veterans, get money from. Voters and supporters, and altho veterans are actively trying to give you their information. Have some given up, go to to door. You think he would do that? 
>> Thousands of volunteers and aide staffers have been working nonstop, knocking on doors, making phone calls and getting people to vote early. 
>> Jon: Mother 
( bleep )! You could clear up this v.A. Thing in a month! Clearly, the lesson appears to be, if we could take the same urgency, enthusiasm, and clarity of vision you need to get elected to government and apply those two dporching. Can we fix some problems? WHY, WE MOTHER 
( BLEEP ) C;"-X??a7??Q2$ 
[00:14:05]



( Cheersrs and applause ). 
>> Jon: Recently, we've been reading the the "daily show" has become something of a popular internet sensation in china, of all places. Apparently the citizens of america's foremost global competitor like to have a little laugh at the foibles of us yankees. You know what I mean? A-ha, their economy is in shambles. They are dragons are so small. 
( Laughter ) very funny, china. Before you get too comfortable, perhaps it's time we check in on the latest installment of our regular series, things may be bad but least our streets don't murp mystery goo. I should probably explain. 
>> This big foam, and according to meademeadia reporter, fouling smell appeared saturday evening. Apparently the street cracked out and it just started to ooze out. 
>> Jon: The mystery ooze of manned jing, perhaps the most disgusting of the nancy drew books. I guess-- I guess the first question I've got to request sc in any situation that involves ooze, how much ooze are we talking about? 
>> It spread 150 foot radius and nearly a foot high. 
>> Jon: So nearly high enough to touch china's poisonous air. Leaving what the chinese call sweet spot, or air. What is the ooze I would go with a slurry of 
( bleep ) and bis quick. So I assume the famed scientist of china came up way solution. 
>> The area was cordoned off and the ooze was washed into the sewer. No one know what the ooze is or where it came from or where it seems back into. 
[00:16:19]



( Laughter ) 
>> Jon:6,000 years of culture and science, and you come up with hose. So the mysterious foul-smelling probably poisonous ooze probably went back into the ground where you keep your water. Don't get so highand mighty, china. We've got on problems but at least we don't have weird substances appearing in our city street. 
>> This is piling up in the street. Big churnings were founder on the sidewalk. 
>> That by-product is now to the surprise and dismay of many to be trucked to two sites. 
>> Jon: We'll be right BACK.I,,X,X?p?p?pC 
[00:19:49]



( Cheers and applause ) 
>> Jon: Welcome back. My guest tonight a very fine actress. Her new film is called "the east." 
>> You make your living by poisoning this creek and other rivers and lakes and you separate yourself in your gated communities with golf courses from the world you're destroying. From the families who cannot afford to move away from this creek. Or from the cancer their children aring dying of. You create, for a living, toxic chemicals that will outlive us all and feels nothing. 
>> Jon: Story of nanjing. Please welcome welcome ellen page. 
( Cheers and applause ). Thank you for being here. 
>> Are you kidding me? Thank you for having me. I couldn't be a bigger fan of your show. 
>> Jon: Thank you. That's very kind of you. We're big fans of yours. I've been here over 27 years. From the sphirs day I started i said get me ellen page. 
>> How did you know my mom was pregnant? 
>> Jon: How old are you? 26. 
>> Jon: I knew it! 
>> Wait, how did you know my mom was pregnant. I was in a little club in canada. Halifax, nova scotia-- if I may say this and this is not to offend people in canada who live in other areas-- maybe the most beautiful place in canada. It's pretty gorgeous in terms of-- and by the way, the lox that they make. Make. 
>> I know, you cannot break those locks locks. The audience that we get 
( laughter ) is such a weird mix of canadians and rabbis and, like, that i idea which joke. Is that a popular calling? 
[00:21:55]



>> It is a very popular calling. 
>> Jon: What is this thing? It looks very interesting. Are youing living in, like a community of very echo minded individuals. 
>> The movie is about a group of ecoactivists over the incredible injustice and atrocities being committed by large corporations and do something about it. 
>> Jon: So it's a fiction. Clearly, corporations don't. And the film is about a corporate spry who infiltrates the group to figure out their plan. 
>> Jon: Is this a true story. 
>> It's not based on a specific true story but of course everything in the film is real things that are happening and very, very relevant right now. On the one hand you probably have a lot of sympathy for people fighting to preserve the jiermt and those kinds of things. But on the other hand, how do you justice some of their actions which are pretty damaging and people get hurt. 
>> Of course. This is why I think the film is interesting. I believe these people have incredible validity with theiranger and mission and what they're angry at. But of course I don't believe in hurting people. 
>> Jon: It's a very thin line between sort of when you get up to that and what is raichous activism what is dangerous. 
>> Of course. And I think-- sarah's struggle as she starts getting a window to a different perspective. And trial to deal with the difficulties that that presents I am very much an environmentalist. I recycle. Are you familiar with nespro pods? My moment is built with them. Every coffee drink I drink, I to it and it go write into the facade of my building. Pretty gnarly smelling building. Now are you are you-- do you live in canada? 
[00:24:17]



>> No, I live in l.A. 
>> Jon: For someone from such a beautiful part of the world where people are kind and I would think doin to earth and honest. 
( Cheers and applause ). 
>> Wow. 
( Bleep ), whrooep. 
>> Jon: Have you ever visited somewhere where people were angry atica nadians. No but I wouldn't blame places for being angry atica canadians. I love being from canada and love a lot of things about the country but we're not perfect 
( laughter ) 
>> Jon: Yes, you are. 
( Cheers and applause ) from a canadian perspective, what would you take issue with? Because we look at it up there and we think where are your bank failures? 
>> There are a lot of great things about canada. Public health care-- 
( cheers and applause ) when you hear, you know, the misinformation from, you know, certain news networks about 
-- 
>> I know what you're talking about. 
>> Your sister news network, foxy news. It's very funny because when you grow up with something like that in canada and then you hear about the system here, and you're like excuse me? What? And we have the situation with the tar sands right now which is decimate, our environment. But you have so much environment to decimate. 
>> Exactly. 
>> Jon: Do you look at us-- like when you look at us do you guys go, like, those guys. Or is it more they're going to break something. 
>> I think there's a little more maybe camaraderie of spirit, a little less fear and we think take care of each other a bit more and don't sort of 
-- 
[00:26:20]



>> you're commies. 
>> We are dirty commies. 
>> Well, the east is going to be in the theaters on may 31. You have to be a big fan of this lady.

=======================================================

Captioning sponsored by Comedy central from comedy central's world news headquarters in new york this is the daily show with jon stewart. 
>> Jon: Hey, welcome tohe daily show, my name is jon stewart. Man we have a show for you tonight. Coming on the program tonight, 11 time nba champion coach phil jackson will be joining us. Phil jackson, the least known member of the jackson 5. Listen to this, who's that tall white guy? Standing next to tito? We all know national politics is-- but local government ain't bean bag, people. I don't know what any of that meant. Just phrases I picked up from watching any random 30 seconds of chris matthews. But my point is this, even mayor, mayors can find themselves embroiled in scandal whether it is the way they react to local complaints about raise profiling of hispanics. 
>> What are you doing about latino community today. 
>> I might have tacos when i go home. (Laughter) 
>> Jon: I will never tire of taco mayor. Like the snack he believes will ease the tension between his office and latino community, I can never get enough. (Laughter) but the great thing about mayors is they can maintain the excentriciies that get sanded off and focus grouped out of statewide or national politician, endearing policies like fear of large beverages. Or being a nine and a half fingered bulgarian or having meat and cheese for a head. 
[00:02:03]


(Laughter) guess which one of those mayors is not kosher. Guy with the cheeseburger for a head. But evening amongst the idiosyncratic some mayors stand out. For instance toronto mayor former city councilman who has been very popular in toronto for his love of sports-- and his warm relations with the press, yes, the camera just absolutely loves this mayor. (Laughter) how you don't have that shot from the pov. Camera he walked into, criminal. Now of course don't think this guy is just all pratfalls with come dee, he has been photographed with his arm around a neo-nazi and explained why stores should be opened an statutory holidays thusly. 
>> What some are calling a backhanded compliment to toronto's aging community. 
>> Those oriental people worked like dogs. They worked their hearts out. Ey are workers nonstop. They sleep beside their machines. The oriental people, they are slowly taking over. 
>> Jon: Perhaps he'll have to have some egg rolls tonight to make up for that. After repeated instances of this type of behavior you have got to wonder, is this dude on crack? Well, funny story. 
>> There's a cell phone video that shows the mayor allegedly smoking a crack pipe. 
>> Jon: Hey, hey! Don't judge him. Maybe he's cleaning up the city by smoking all the crack in it. You're next, prostitution ring. (Laughter) the cell phone video which is apparently viewed by the toronto star and the web site gawker, it appears the video shows the mayor of toronto smoking crack with drug dealers. Ladies and gentlemen, the deputy mayor of toronto. 
[00:04:13]



>> Certainly we all know that videos can be altered. And we certainly know that drug dealers can't be trusted. 
>> Jon: Photos can easily be altered. But videos? That's some james cameron [bleep] (laughter) by the way, if you can alter videos why wouldn't you start with these two. (Laughter) it's the camera one that does it every time. We've all tripped playing football but-- interestingly ford's personal lawyer does not appear to be going the fake video route. The mayor's l intend-- instead asked quote how you can indicate what the person is actually doing or smoking? I mean that clear pipe in his hand could be anything from asthma medicine to wonder woman's famed invisible pipe of truth to a waterford crystal kazoo to crack. It could be crack, I guess. For more we turn to our senior canadian correspondent samantha bee and jason jones. They join usnow from toronto. Sam, thanks for-- sam. 
>> Yes. (Cheers and applause) sam, it was supposed to be awe and jason, where is jason. 
>> Oh, he'll be right back. He's just buying some crack. 
>> Jon: Wait, jason, crack. 
>> Yeah, he's canadian! Jon, we all do it, smoking crack is one of canada's most cherished pastimes. 
>> Jon: So 
-- 
>> sorry I'm late. I was just buying some crack. (Laughter) it's one of canada's most cherished pastimes. 
>> I already said that. 
>> Sorry about that, I'm just whacked out of my mind on crack. 
>> Jon: Jason, that's an awful lot of crack you've got there. 
>> Well, I've got three kids at home, jon. And they all smoke crack. 
[00:06:17]



>> Jon: I'm-- my mine is blown here, you know. Its canadian past time i think of canada I think of politeness and clean streets and 
-- 
>> well, sure, jon, it's all of that on the surface. 
>> And just under that surface is a thick layer of crack. 
>> Yeah. 
>> Jon, canada is notike the postcards you buy at niagara fall, it's like the postcards you buy from the guy in toronto whose [bleep] you suck for crack. 
>> Jon: What? You are on-- you are on television, so you-- you guys have to [bleep] for crack? 
>> Uh, yeah, yeah, sure, we have to. (Laughter) 
>> jon, why do you think they only sell alcohol at government run dispensais. Can want-- we can't be trusted with anything. It's like that old french canadian saying, s'il est dans la maison. 
>> If it's in the house. 
>> Nous il fumee. 
>> We will smoke it. 
>> Apres bee coup degrande blow jobs. 
>> You can probably translate that one yourself. 
>> Jon: Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, jason! Jayson, stop that, are you smoking crack right now? 
>> It's 6 a.M. Somewhere. 
>> Oh my god, jon, are you judging us? This is our national letter taj. Not to mention the driver of our economy. Can ga's large-- canada's largest national industry is crack production. And our second largest industry is giving blow jobs for crack! 
>> Jon: This sin sane. I mean it's like canada is that friend you have in high school that all your parents love them because he's so polite and calls everybody mr. And mrs. S but you find out he is a date rapest with a roofy 
-- 
>> wloe, easy, we are not a nation of date rapists. We are a nation of blow job bestowing crack afficionadoes. By the way, you got any crack, I'll blow you for it? 
[00:08:19]



>> Jon: Jason, you have a wol back! 
>> Oh, right, jeez, I forgot, forgot about this. It's the crack. It really [bleep] with your head. You want a hit of this? 
>> Is the-- the capital of nunavutt. Give me the [bleep] crack, give me 
-- 
>> all right. 
>> Jon: Samantha bee and jason jones, everybody, 
[00:11:20]



>> Jon: Welcome back. Cable news, cable news, it's loud, it's vapid but at least it's available-- what more could anyone want al madrigal has the shocking end. 
>> Easy access to fresh and healthy food is a challenge for millions of americans. But some farmers in southern california think they have solved the problem by using hydroponics. An they're even employing u.S. Veterans to do it. 
>> We're able to deliver a much more nutritious, faster growing, tastier and more robust 
-- 
>> wait a second. Hold on. I think I know this guy's bloated angrier brother. 
>> This is not some opinion. This is a mathematical fact. Are you wasting valuable oxygen. 
>> Can we please cut off this man's microphone. He has no intention of answering my questions. 
>> No, that is I did lan mad I again from msnbc. But what he is doing here? 
>> There was very little incentive or desire from the left or right wing media apparatus to actually resolve any problems. It became apparent that there was more value in working with veterans to deploy a high technology hydroponic organic farming system than there was in participanting in a hollow political debate. 
>> So you think making a farm that employs veterans is more fulfilling than cable news? 
>> That's correct. 
>> It is like the incredible hulk. No one cares about bill --by. I want to see you pounding your fist on the desk, yelling at some blond chick. 
>> Why sit around arguing with people in a circle when we could actually be building greenhouses creating jobs. 
>> I can stop you there? This doesn't feel right. You can bring that in, please? 
>> Thanks. 
>> Nass's better. We can talk like normal people now. 
>> We're on a farm. 
>> Trust me, I work in television, you don't, any more. 
>> Even his former colleagues can't believe what he's turning his back on. 
[00:13:22]



>> What would possess an anchor of a daily television program to walk away from all his apparent success. 
>> But de walk away. And it was shocking just how far he had fallen. 
>> Wait a second, are those [bleep]. 
>> Yes, they are. 
>> What's wrong with you. 
>> What's wrong with crock. 
>> Nothing if you are three. Are you a grown man. 
>> What if I was barefoot,. 
>> Flip a coin. 
>> What kind of [bleep] am i? 
>> It was becoming clear, since he checked out of his old life he had forgotten everything that truly matters. 
>> Basically what you are looking at is a system that use 90% less water, grows three times as much food at three times as quickly. 
>> What about the other side of that issue, what do those people think? 
>> What dow mean other side. 
>> The side that disagrees with whatever you are saying. 
>> We're actually joined by keith myers from lovit, texas who is a plumber and-- water all the time. Keith wa, do you think about dylan's plan for a waterless society. 
>> Being a plumber I make my living off water. You take away the water, you take away my job. 
>> Yeah, I don't think there's actually an issue. There is a meaningful water shortage around the world. And what we're doing is creating jobness. 
>> I will have to stop you there, we take a quick break with more on the water issue, you are watching tbs 247. 
>> Bloep bloep. 
>> Step up. Bring it. Farming is [bleep] with your head. 
>> AND old McDonald had plenty of critiques for the state of cable news. 
>> Too focused on feelings and not focused enough on fact. The same pundits that sort of echo what they think, they will use panels to basically to make the audience feel that there are people like them that 
-- 
>> true, let's find out. 
[00:15:23]



>> I like the panels because it's like a team sport. I'm there to root for my team. 
>> I like to know other viewpoints, and it makes me feel usually that I'm right. And I also get bored if it's just one person talking. 
>> So this panel is pro panel. 
>> Absolutely. 
>> Yeah. 
>> Yes. 
>> Despite all the evidence, he maintains he made the right decision. 
>> I find the work as I said to be incredibly fulfilling. 
>> But is he telling the truth? 
>> We're joined by body language expert nova reid. Nova, do you think dylan here is truly fulfilled? 
>> His body language is leaning forward, his shoulders are slightly jostling from side to side. Somebody that fulfilled, their body languaged is leaning back. 
>> More relaxed. 
>> Dylan what do you think. 
>> I think I was walking up a hill. So I lean back on the hill i will fall down, I have to lean forward to walk up the hill. 
>> She's the expert. 
>> Not fulfilled, man. 
>> Walking up a hill, bro. 
>> In the end, we all have to realize that it's the audience who calls the shots. 
>> So show of hands, how many people want to see dylan back on television? 
>> That guy [bleep] hates you. 
>> But don't worry, farmer, if you ever get tired of hiring veterans and fixing world hunger, just remember this guy is out there, waiting for another shot. 
>> IGAL,DRIGAL,wv rK ??X??X were jobs available out there. I knew DeVry university would give me the skills that I needed to make one of those tech jobs mine. We teach cutting-edge engineering technology, computer information systems, networking and communications management 
-- the things that our students need to know in the world today. Our country needs more college grads to help fill all the open technology jobs.

[00:20:45]



>> Welcome back. My guest tonight legendary nba coach who has won 11 championships as the coach, two as an nba player. His new book is called 11 ring, the sole of success. Please welcome to the program mr. Phil jackson. How are you? 
>> Wait a minute, do you realize we're the same size right now. 
>> All right, the book is 11-- look at this one of these makes you the green lantern but where-- but you have two player rings from the knicks. 
>> That's right. 
>> Where are they? 
>> They are not part of coaching. This is about leadership and coaching and that kind of stuff. Those are warriorship and playing, right. 
>> But I am-- they are great. They are great rings. 
>> I have to say, so much of what this book is about is managing not these just larger-than-life physical people but the larger-than-life personalities. The chapters on the shack and kobe relationship seem especially tenuous, that each, you know, shaq and could bee both have strong personalities t seemed like navigate flag was one of the bigger challenges. 
>> It was probably one of the hardest challenges I had in coaching over all those years, 20 years that i coached. Because there was always this little tension about my team, it's my team, play ball my style, get the ball inside, no, I want to do stuff out that type of thing. 
>> Jon: But you talk about how you let it go. There is a very 
-- the book is laced with sort of muted teachings of sort of inner peace. You said let them burn it out. You never intervened in their squabble, you let them burn it out. Have you read this book, by the way. 
[00:22:46]



>> No, I wrote it. 
>> Jon: You seem somewhat unfamiliar with it. 
>> The idea is that basically, you know, you are a parent, you have two kids, are you going to get involved in every squabble that happens in your house that they-- you just can't do that. You ware yourself out trying to monitor all that. So the big stuff comes along, you save the big stuff for the right time. 
>> Jon: You just saved my life. I have two littles at home AND I MONITOR EVERY des Current see. Now when you watch cobe now, are you tempted to-- I know there was a lot of talk about all these superstars, but dow watch that, dow want to call him, do you send advice or are you just completely hands-off in these situations. 
>> No, it's hands-off. You know, kobe texted me a considerable amount of time. We send messages back and forth. And I will just say, you know, it looks like you are-- or things were tough, you had to do so much work last night, you know, trying to score, carry the team when you are down, whatever. But we never get into the offensive end of stuff. You know, we never talk about the defense either. We just let the game come and just talk about the individual game. 
>> Right. 
>> Since I was almost hired by the lakers and then not hired by the lakers. 
>> Did they call you and try and get you because I was under the impression that you were not interested in coaching any more. 
>> That's what I told-- the general manager, that you know, I wasn't interested in kochk. But of course I live in. Will amount of and all those players that were on the lakers were players that were on the team that i coached before. So my fiancee said will you please listen them and let them explain why they want you to coach the team. 
>> What is her relationship to the lakers, if you may? 
>> She is the vice president in charge of finance. 
>> Oh. 
>> So your fiancee, the vice president in charge says you should really listen the lakers and you say honey, you know, I'm not that interested? Does she accept that or does she put on her vice president hat and try and convince you.

=======================================================


>> Today on "the dr. Oz show," is your home a breeding ground for germs. Dr. Oz: I can't believe the things you found germs on. 
>> Common mistakes you're making, the top germ hot spots in your kitchen and bathroom revealed. 
>> We found e. Coli and mold. 
>> Solutions to get rid of the germs fast. And rachael ray makes over your summer guilty pleasures. Dr. Oz: These are so good. 
>> Aren't they great? 
>> Next. Dr. Oz: I was up late one night and I stumbled across a study that blew my mind. 20% of food borne illnesses come from mistakes in our kitchens. Many of these mistakes even i make. If you know what they are, they're easily avoidable. Today I enlisted my friends at the nation's top germ-fighting organization to find the germiest places in your home and they're here telling you how to kill those germs once and for all. They're the germ busters working behind the scenes to keep your family healthy. The national sanitation foundation. And their newly released study is revealing the germiest room in your house, the heart of your home where you gather for good food and good conversation. It's your kitchen. Scientists carefully analyzed common surfaces and appliances throughout the kitchen and detected all kinds of disease carrying food borne germs including e. Coli, sal month knellia and listeria. We'll reveal the surprising places where germs are lurking in your kitchen and the sanitizing solutions to keep your kitchen germ-free. 
>> A microbiologist is here to reveal the results of your study. I can't believe where you have found germs. Let's start with the countertops, the first item shocked me, I use it every day, the blender. What's the bacterial breeding ground here? 
[00:02:17]



>> This is a blender. We found things like e. Coli, salmonella and yeast and mold. Dr. Oz: Every day? 
>> We use it every day. We're all eating from this. Dr. Oz: I wash it out. 
>> This actually comes apart and it disassembles a lot of people don't know that. The blade comes out and the gasket comes out. Right here, this is the culprit where we found a lot of germs right here. Dr. Oz: What's the key to keeping this clean? 
>> What you need to do is disassemble it after every use, take it all apart. If it's dishwasher safe, you can put the lid, the gasket, the blade all in the dishwasher. If not, wash it by hand in hot soapy water. The key to this is making sure you drall of the pieces rately before you reassemble. Moisture is something that germs like. Dr. Oz: I never thought about it. Who thought this needed to come out or to clean it. Coffee maker. I have never thought about cleaning out the coffeemaker. I take the filter out, the boiling water would sterlize it anyway. What makes it the germ hot spot? 
>> The reservoir, the place you put the water in. It's a dark, moyes environment. It's a prime spot for bacteria and mold. We use this every day. We never think to clean it. Dr. Oz: Who has cleaned their coffeemaker, please be honest? 
>> Three people in the back row. They got here late. They were cleaning their coffeemaker. How do you make your coffeemaker germ-free? 
>> What you can do is about every 40 to 80 uses, once a month or every two months, take four cups of undiluted white vinegar and pour it into the reservoir. Pour it all the way in. Dr. Oz: This is not pure white vinegar, is it? 
>> This is the real stuff. You put it in there and you let it set for 30 minutes. Then you're going to run it through. This is like a cleanse for your coffeemaker. 
[00:04:18]


Dr. Oz: I different kind of enema. 
>> That's right for your coffeemaker. What you want to do after that is run through two to three runs with fresh tap water just until that vinegar smell is gone. Dr. Oz: We have talked about light vinegar on the show, great disinfectant, relative safe. Smart idea. Spungses, I knew sponges were a glad idea. I never through one away personally. Someone did it for me, they keep recurring all the time. How do you clean a sponge? 
>> The sponge is the number one germiest spot in most homes. It's the easiest to sanitize. All you have to do is once a day put your wet sponge into your microwave for two minutes. You can throw it away as needed. Dr. Oz: My wife buys a lot of sponges. So many there, you're tempted to go-through them. The two-week number is hard to stick to. 
>> You can also use a dish cloth or a dish rag and throw that in your washing machine on the bleach cycle. That is something you can keep rather than throw it away. Dr. Oz: How about the steel wool things, worn down. 
>> You can use that. It's hard to keep clean and more abrasive. Dr. Oz: Next hot spot in the kitchen is the utensils drawer. Two very important items were found in your report. These were breeding grounds forr germs. The first is a rubber spatula. Why would this, this looks their innocuous to me. Why is that a problem? 
>> A lot of the spatulas come in a two-piece design. These pieces can actually be pulled apart. Dr. Oz: Oh, my goodness! 
>> Right. Dr. Oz: Did you know the top came off the spatula? No one knew that. The men didn't, that's for sure. 
>> This is something you use every day. You use it to cook meat, cook eggs, everything. This part right in here never sees the light of day for cleaning. We found e! Coaly which can cause illness and we found yeast and mold which can be a problem for allergy sufferers. 
[00:06:34]


Dr. Oz: E! Coaly comes from stool. 
>> Correct. Dr. Oz: Where are people putting their spatulas? How do you clean this thing off? 
>> You want to make sure you separate the pieces. You want to wash these pieces separate. They're dishwasher safe. You can use hot soapy water. Make sure it's dry before you reassemble. If it's a one-piece design, pay special attention to the ridge or the area between the head and the handle. Dr. Oz: The other item seemed really random to me, the can opener. Be honest, how many of you ever thought about really washing the can opener. Most of us just rinse it off. We have a clean part of the audience here, the lady in the red glasses, she is confident. 
>> The can opener is a problem area because of this blade right here. We found a lot of germs on this blade. This area is something that can touch your food and then it can go on to contaminate other foods. You can't just put it in the drawer. You need to really focus on this area, wash it, scrub it. If you need to get rid of that food residue, you can use a brush, a clean tooth brush works well. Dr. Oz: You can put this in the dash washer as well? 
>> If it's dishwasher safe, yes. If not, hot soapy water. Dr. Oz: When I read the piece and 20% of all food illnesses were coming from our kitchen. I didn't realize where. They can sneak up on us. These are small little issues i wouldn't think of twice. Finally the fridge. We're going to walk you through where in the refrigerator are your risker areas. What did you find in the fridge? 
>> In our study we found four main areas that were problem areas across the board. Those areas were the meat drawer, the vegetable drawer, the ice container, and the insulator seal. Here we found things like e. Coli, witnesses terra, salmonella and yeast and mold. 
[00:08:36]


Dr. Oz: How do you clean these things? 
>> The drawers can come out. You want to take these drawers out and empty them. Dr. Oz: That was fast. I haven't done it before. That was an unpracticed hand doing that. 
>> You just remove all of the contents. You can use a clean sponge and a mild detergent and water just to wipe them down, dry them off. Dr. Oz: I have never taken out manufacture icemaker at home. Never. I didn't ril today i could push one button and the whole thing would come out like this. 
>> Right, a lot of people don't know that. Dr. Oz: Wouldn't the ice, the coldness stop the bacteria? Why would you have bacteria in here? 
>> Some bacteria can still grow at refrigerated temperatures, they just grow slower. Dr. Oz: How do you clean this out, same thing? 
>> A clean sponge, mild dergent, wipe it out and get ll clean. For the insulator seal, you can wipe this down pretty easily. Dr. Oz: How do you stop the germs from spreading in the fridge in the first place, so many things can have contaminants? 
>> Cross-contamination, there is always a potential for. We can take certain steps to prevent that. It's just the nature of food. First of all, for the refrigerator, you want to make sure that you keep it below 40 degrees. Also, for your produce, you want to make sure that things are bagged and separated, so you want to keep your prewashed away from your raw and unwashed. You want to prevent that cross-contamination. For your meats, you want to make sure that meat and poultry and seafood are kept separate. They're wrapped well. They're contained. You don't want their juices to you don't want any other foods touching that. Dr. Oz: I love reading your work. You can find the full report and instructions for cleaning the germiest items in your kitchen on doctoroz.Com. Up next, I had my audience, all of you guys bring in items they think are the germiest in their bathrooms and then we did the test. You will not believe what we found. Stay with us. 
[00:10:37]


[Cheers and applause] 
>> coming up, items from your bathroom. Dr. Oz: Anything over a score of 80 is unsanitary. 
>> You thought they were clean. Dr. Oz:7,506. 
>> Surprising ways to kill the germs. Dr. Oz: When was the last time you cleaned this? 
>> Never. 
>> And rachael ray is here just in time. Stay with us. 
[00:13:34]


[Cheers and applause] dr. Oz: Today I'm reviewing the surprising germ hot spots in your home. Up next, the bathroom. I asked my audience to bring in the grossest, grimiest, germ-infested items. We will reveal the unsuspecting owners of the dirtiest items. To be fair, I also tested something of mine I use every day, I put my on. Amazingly, anything over a score of 80, by the way is unsanitary. My tea filter, see how benign that looks, my tea filter had a score of 348. So I don't want the audience feeling guilty. You are not alone. The director of the cleaning products lab from good house keeping institute is here to tell us how to keep the items clean and safe. The first item we identified, not surprisgly, we found somebody's tooth brush and their tooth brush holder. Please come join us. [Cheers and applause] 
>> how are you? 
>> I'm good, how are you? 
>> Are you surprised? 
>> Not really. Not really. I mean I know I have had it for a little bit. 
>> The germ score on your toothbrush is 163 which is two times what we consider sanitary. It's not that bad, though, because the holder, 7,506. 
>> Did you really have to say the number? Dr. Oz: Through your research, what did you find about germ infested toothbrushes and holders? 
>> When we put it in our mouths, they stay wet and water, there is germ the toothbrush and the holder should be cleaned, and the toothbrush replaced frequently. The biggest thing you can do is to close the lid when you flush the toilet. It's amazing how much airborne germs can come from a flushed toilet. Keep them covered up. Keep them closed. Wash them frequently, the toothbrush can go right in the dishwasher. 
[00:15:40]


Dr. Oz: Who can forget this little animation. Putting it up on the screen so we all can see it. Remember this. At 20 feet in the air when you flush the toilet. Ladies, I can promise you all, the men in your life, they're not closing the lid on the toilet. They're flushing away in there. The smart thing to do is put this in the medicine cabinet and keep it away from any ntamination from your toilet. 
>> Once a week, put the brush in the dishwasher. Take the holder apart. Many of those holders come apart. Put them in the dishwasher or soak them in bleach and water. Dr. Oz: A little pregnant. [Applause] dr. Oz: Come on down, heather. There she is. Heather, how many children do you have? 
>> I have one daughter, she is 3. Dr. Oz: She must be a cutie, i bet. 
>> She is a princess. Dr. Oz: What is her name? 
>> Riley. Tolerable, yours is 4,402. 
>> No, so embarrassed. Dr. Oz: A big number. A pretty high risk of bacterial contamination. 
>> I only have had that toy about three weeks. 
>> Oh, boy. Dr. Oz: In three weeks. What did she do with the toy? 
>> Just in the tub. It was in my suitcase, too. Dr. Oz: Your suitcase? 
>> Flying up here. Dr. Oz: Should have tested the suitcase, too. Why is it such a big risk here? 
>> They get wet, trap water inside. They can collect water inside. You want to make sure that you drain them well, rinse and drain them well. Put them in a mesh bag or basket so they don't sit in standing water. These, too, if they're solid toys, put them in the dishwasher. You can soak them in a bleach and water solution. That's safe to do as well. If you're concerned, if they smell kind of funky or have some stains on them you can't get off, toss them and get a new one. Dr. Oz: Keep this just in case. 
>> You can have it. Dr. Oz: The last item in the bathroom that concerns me is the shower curtain lining. The shower curtain lining, whose is this? Tammy, we know it's you, tammy. Come on down. 
[00:17:51]


[Applause] dr. Oz: Welcome, tammy. I'm so happy you're here. 
>> Thank you, nice to be here, I guess. Dr. Oz: Tammy, just out of curiosity, when was the last time you cleaned it? 
>> Never, I switch it out, but never clean it. Dr. Oz: Score, 3,148. That's as bad as that toy next to us. So carolyn, without having visual mold which are the values you look for, how can you tell it's contaminated? 
>> You have hot water stains. Think about the shower. Hot water, soap scum, body oils and it will grow in the cracks and crevices. Many people don't know that you can wash it. I take my plastic liner all the time, put it in the washing machine, hot water, bleach, and old towels, it scrubs it clean and you can hang it back up. Dr. Oz: Did you know it was possible? 
>> I thought twos just rip in the machine. 
>> It doesn't. One of theings you can do between uses is stretch it out. Open the shower curtain when you're done with the shower. It's the folds where the mold grows and the water gets trapped. If there is water, there will be germs. 
>> Two men in the house, there were be germs. 
>> Thank you. Dr. Oz: We have tackled the bathroom and the kitchen, which has more germs, the pillow or computer keyboard, we'll find out next. Do you know?

>> hi, everybody! How are you? Nice to see you! Daphne was on our show, I went on her show. I have had a week of oz. Dr. Oz: Thanks for joining me. You have been so busy, I have not been able to connect to you at all. Besides going to the emmy awards, nominated for an emmy award again, every year. Cleags. 
>> I get a week away from my husband. I'm excited. Dr. Oz: What do you do in the summer? 
>> On the weekend, we go upstate. John brings in the vegetables. I cook them up. We basically just cook on the weekends and I do what I do the rest of the year, I cook on television all summer. Dr. Oz: How do you stay healthy in the center, what do you do special? 
>> I run every day. It's fun in the summer to go up in the woods with the dog and take her with us. We do a lot of boating out on the lake. I'm not a very good swimmer, i have to say. My husband swims a lot in the summer. I just 
-- dr. Oz: Tread water. 
>> I lost to horseback ride, too. That's pretty good extra workout. Dr. Oz: A good core exercise. 
>> It is. Dr. Oz: Word got out that rachael was on today's show. Everybody wanted to ask her about their summer recipes. The first question is from ruby. 
>> I love summer because of the food. The potato salad is my favorite. It's my weakness. It's steamy, cold, and delicious. Can I keep my favorite food? 
[00:31:07]


Dr. Oz: Potato salad, how do you make it healthier? 
>> Potato salad or coleslaw, you can simply omit the mayo, and make it with oil and vinegar. Another great alternative, if you want that creamy factor, instead of going with your mayo potato salad, use a lowfat greek yogurt. Super tangy, use that as your base. I'm going to show you my favorite way to serve up a greek style potato salad. Lots of vege mixed in with the potato. Depot today toe, peppers, onions, throw a lot of valuables in there. I'm grating in some garlic. Dr. Oz: A lot of garlic in there. 
>> Not too much, it's good for you, come on. Dr. Oz: The italian in you? 
>> Exactly. Salt and pepper, lots of lemon juice to brighten that up. Fresh herbs. Dr. Oz: Can I add the herbs? 
>> Yes, please. Dr. Oz: I get to help. 
>> Parsley, go easy on the oregano, it's very floral. Use this as your dressing and then at the very end, I put in a little bit more protein, throw that feta cheese in here. Dr. Oz: Why feta cheese? 
>> It adds tang and it's go greek salad. Throw on the calamat olives, potatoes, lowfat greek yogurt, lots of tang and no mayo and it's insanely delicious. Dr. Oz: I have decided to share with the audience, is that ok? 
>> Objecting. Dr. Oz: Who wants to taste these? You want to go first? Don't eat it all at once now. Dr. Oz: No pressure, I'm right here. Dr. Oz: She is staring right at you, an eye line on you guys. 
>> Fantastic. Dr. Oz: One down. The next question. 
[00:33:09]



>> Nothing beats a juicy burger at a summer barbecue, especially on a fluffy bun and ooey goy cheddar cheese. It means summer has arrived. What can I do to make my burger healthy? Dr. Oz: It's hard to compete with this. How do you make a healthier burger? 
>> A burger is a beautiful thing. I love them. Everyone loves them with the fixings, but it is a lot of calories. If you're burger addicted and you eat a couple of them a week 
-- dr. Oz: That would put you over the top. 
>> This is a figure friendly way to enjoy burgers. You want to put these little guys on here for me. You can throw them, sure, you can use the tongs if you like to. Little two ounce burgers of any protein you like and get rid of the bun. We put it on a bed of let us, tomato and onion. It's really a burger salad. It's little slider sized burgers over the salad. I make salad dressing like burger condiments. Mix this all together and then you drizzle the relish and yellow mustard dressing down over the salad. It's figure friendly. It's delicious. It's nutritious. Dr. Oz: We should reinvent the burger. This looks to me very appealing. 
>> On a hot day, this is more refreshing and it hits all the same bells and whistles than that. After this you go into a food coma and take a swim. Dr. Oz: To avoid the food coma, let me try this with members of the audience, I don't want to leave you guys out. Let's see what they have to say , the lightened burger, I'm serious about this, with all of those buns and stuff 
-- 
>> you don't need it. Put it on the let us, delicious. Dr. Oz: Are you going to ask your wife about it first? 
>> Don't need to. Dr. Oz:2-2. 2-2! 
[00:35:10]


[Cheers and applause] dr. Oz: The final question for rachael comes from stephanie. 
>> I blow my diet snacking at every summer party. I pile my plate with chips and dip. Can you help me? 
>> Chips and dip, almost impossible to make this healthser. 
>> Well, actually, it isn't. There are lots of healthy ways to dip your chips. Any salsa, it's just vegetables. Pick and choose. If you're talking about oh, wow, yeah, the classic good old french onion soup dip or anything thais mayo-based, yes, super fattening, easy way to add on a lot of calories. You are talking about a healthy choice like salsa, in the summer you can grow any vegetable. We have beautiful corn here. When you're scraping corn, cut the ends off. Stand it up on the end to catch it and scrape it off. Peppers, onions, zucchini, grill it up and chop it up and add it into red or green salsa se. You're adding extra vegetables. You'll eat a little bit of the veg and fewer of the chips. You could eat all of that. It's not going to put you in a larger jean size. Dr. Oz: One last test, if they're going to stay on thinner jean sizes 
-- 
>> you have the corn on the cob. Dr. Oz: I like the corn. Give it a shot. Rachael is so close, she can hit you if you don't like it. 
>> You're going to really like that salsa. It's good, right? 
>> Delicious. 
>> How could you not like that? Dr. Oz: The corn so much is good. 
>> I love corn so much, when i was a little kid, I fell asleep on the highchair with a cob sticking out of my mouth, couldn't get it away from me. Dr. Oz: Coming up, the one sinful summertime dish, it's fatty and not usually healthy. Rachael has promised to help me out. We're going to make it over, stay with us.

>> My daughter daphne was on rachael ray's show, she let out a little family secret. 
>> The way to dr. Oz's heart is with delicious ribs. 
>> Seriously? 
>> Rachael, I know you have a good recipe for this. A big old pile of ribs. 
>> I'm bringing ribs. 
>> I'm bringing the ribs. Dr. Oz: All right, so rachael brought ribs and is here to show us how to make a healthier version of the summer indulgence. There is the meat and the sauce. How is your version healthier? 
>> A couple of little tricks here. I use the same trick when making chicken wings. I never fry them, I par boil them. I take baby back ribs. You're starting with a fairly lean rib. Instead of slow cooking it and letting all the fat seap into the meet, you bring a water to a general 
-- gentle boil and simmer them. You let the tabletop grill smoke them a bit, give them that kiss, that char that you're looking for. We left a lot of fan in the pan and a lot of favor. The aromatics, parsley, carrot, celery and it's much quicker. You throw it on the grill for a short amount of time. The next thing is to save some calories and improve the quality of the sauce. When you buy store bought barbecue sauces, turn and read the label. For most of them, the number one ingredient is going to be corn syrup, sugars, artificial flavors. It's not healthy and you're eating a ton of sugar. I start with organic low sugar tomato ketchup as a base. I add in vinegar, a little smokey chipotle. It's smokey and spicy. Then instead of a cup of brown sugar, I use a little dark agave nectar and put in just enough to kiss it with some sweetness. A little garlic. 
[00:42:39]


Dr. Oz: That's to cut down sugar content? 
>> Correct. I garnish when they come off the grill and slather them up with your homemade barbecue sauce. Dr. Oz: Like massage location. Yes, this is your deed. Get your back into it like this. 
>> Try one of these ribs. You're the rib aficionado and see if they would be pleasant to you. You're used to the really fatty ones. Dr. Oz: These are so good, rachael. 
>> Aren't they great, they're delicious. Dr. Oz: Oh, my goodness. [Applause] dr. Oz: Dry rib versus wet rib, educate me. 
>> It's a great treatment, too. You can make a really nice spice rub. It's a great use up if you have a big pantry of spices, it's a great use up for that. That one you have to use a little bit of brown sugar to get the right sugar and texture out of it. That's deliciouso. You can use the same method, parboil to get some of the fat out, slacter with a little of that rub, nice even crust. Throw them on indirect heat just to kiss them and to set that rub on and you're good to go. A little lime or lemon juice if you're doing a dry rib, when it comes off, lots of juice over the top. Dr. Oz: If you don't have a grill, can you 
-- 
>> they're best on the outdoor grill. In new york city, a lot of folks can't have grills. These do a surprisingly good job, the little tabletop plugin grills. You can use a grilled pan. You're getting a char on them. They're already cooked once you cook them with the aromatics. Dr. Oz: My summer indulgence, 718 calories, lots of activity to burn that off. Rachael's are 363 calories. 
>> Yay! Dr. Oz: Unbelievable. Go to doctoroz.Com and check out oz's kitchen and see how easy it substitutions can make them from unhealthy to oz approved approved. Marjorie, you.

[Cheers and applause] dr. Oz: We're back with rachael ray who is revealing some of her family secretary cocktail remisses to get any party started. Her new book is out and you feature your husband john's drinks. 
>> My husband is my co-author. My part of the book is much thicker, we were just chatting about, because john gets the party started with the cocktail, but I have to cook throughout the evening. If you're entertaining in the summer, it is really affordable solution to sitting up a big bar and buying different beers and wines and putting out spirits just make a cocktail and then a dinner, beer or wine, and water. That's the way we do it. It really is affordable, pick one cocktail that matches up with what you're making. If you were making texas mexico foods, these are john's recipes from the book. My husband came up with a clever tomato margarita, which sounds weird, but it's a serving of fruit or vegetable in every cocktail. Dr. Oz: Healthy cocktail. 
>> It's healthy because we're having a full serving of fruit or vegetable with every cocktail. Dr. Oz: Tomato margarita. It's like a bloody mary married a margarita. 
>> This is their love baby. Down in the bottom of your cocktail glass, you're going to muddle up the tomato to get the juices out. You're going to add a little bit of cilantro. Don't go over the board with it. Then you're going to add a little bit of agave syrup. Agave is a great alternative to add a lot of sugary drink bases. A little agave, lots of lime, a little bit of orange curcuo and yourty tila of choice. 
[00:49:15]


Dr. Oz: The tequila. 
>> Barely coming out. Barely taste the food. We have two taste testers to give us an idea of what the audience may think. 
>> Cheers. Ole! Dr. Oz: Ole! 
>> What did you think? 
>> It's yummy, right? She got a big piece of cilantro stuck in her mouth. 
>> It's tasty. 
>> I love the hint of tomato in the ballgame. It's so gogood. Dr. Oz: Good? 
>> Really good. Dr. Oz: I love tomatoes in there. It looks pretty, too. A tomato is a fruit, not a vegetable, why not. Dr. Oz: My favorite vegetable is kale. This is going to perhaps change the lives of many folks who like a little bit of vodka. 
>> My husband calls this one of the brutus, it sounds weird again, it is delicious. In any of your larger grocery stores now, there is the juice section, you can buy kale juice. If you have a high powered blenders, you juice it yourself. We're starting with ice in a shaker. Pour our kale joyce over the top. We're going to sweeten it in with homemade ginger syrup or by it in the grocery store or there is ginger flavored liqueurs on the market. A little lime juice for brightness and citrus and then for this, john used vodka. A couple of shots. Dr. Oz: You chill it? 
>> We keep it in the freezer. It's always chilled. There is ice in here. Shake that up for us, sir. I'm going to rim the glass with a little bit of raw sugar and chili. Dr. Oz: Is that the right way. How does john do it? 
>> He gets really violent. He shows a of his teeth. Dr. Oz: Ladies, take a taste of this so you can vote on it. 
>> I know it sounds weird, go for it. You will like it. You rim the glass with chili and raw sugar, try it, it's delicious. Cheers. 
[00:51:20]


Dr. Oz: Absolutely wonderful. 
>> Isn't that weird. 
>> Worried about the kale but it's really good. 
>> It's crazy, but it's good. 
>> It's really good. Dr. Oz: Which do you like more? 
>> I like this better because i can say I took in my kale. Dr. Oz: What do you think? 
>> I'm liking the tomato margarita. 
>> I love the kale one, too. Dr. Oz: This is the best kale beverage I have ever had in my life. Go to doctoroz.Com for all of these recipes. You can see lots more rachael ray on her week-day show.

[Cheers and applause] dr. Oz: The pins and needles feeling when a body part falls asleep. There is a medical term for it.

All you got to do is tell me which is the correct answer and you get a point. Fair enough? All right. Here goes. Number one word. Is it a silent fart, a stomach rumble or a high pitched sneeze? Buzz in. Yes. 
>> It would be maybe like a high pitched sneeze, it sounds like it. Dr. Oz: Unfortunately, it's actually when your stomach makes the weird noises. The stomach rumble. You get a point, congratulations. Next up, is this man boobs or a broken nose or is it the fear of the gynecologist? 
>> Yes. 
>> Man boobs. 
>> How do you know that? 
>> Masti is like mammaries. Dr. Oz: You're absolutely right. And finally, is it harry toes or in-- hairy toes or the ability to curl your tongue like this or the space between your thumb and forefinger. Not sure, someone has to go first. Who is going to buzz? Yes. 
>> I'm going to say the space between your thumb and forefinger. Dr. Oz: Are you confident? 
>> Not really, dr. Oz. Dr. Oz: You should be because you're correct. Well done.

And now back to our regularly scheduled programming. Here are your five words: Limerick -- a limerick is a special kind of rhyming poem with five lines. Structure -- Structure is how something is put together. Distracted -- If you're distracted, your attention is taken away from something. Valid -- If something is valid, then it means that it counts, it's right. But then there's Invalid -- if something is invalid, then it means that it's wrong. So we have: Limerick, structure, distracted, Valid and Invalid. Watch out for these words in today's show.

Ah, here comes trouble. Hello, Manny. Hello, Hector. I was wondering, do you know what today is? Tuesday, glad to help, bye. Ah, but today is not just any old Tuesday. Manny, what are you talking about? I'm talking about the Limerick Slam, it's today! The greatest limerick competition in the land. Forget it, Manny, I'm not interested. Wait, what's a limerick? A limerick is a poem with its own special pattern, and it goes a little something like this. There once was a boy from the city, who was always so charming and witty, but when it came time to give a great rhyme the result just wasn't so pretty! Come on, Jess, let's go. Come on, Hector, sign up. No, Manny, how about you just win it automatically like you do every other year? Let's go. Hector, what's wrong? Poor Hector was just so afraid of the horrible goof that he made. So, he runs and he hides... Alright Spamboni, don't talk to my brother like that. You want a match? Jessica, no! You got one. Oh, so you think you can limerick? My name is Jess, I'm a lyrical master. Nobody rhymes better, nobody's faster. If you try to beat me, it will be a disaster. Eh! That is not valid! What do you mean it's not valid? It doesn't count, Jess...that's not how you make a limerick. Wait... The limerick competition is on. See you at 3:00 in the theater. Bye-bye! (cackling) Hector... Heyou guys! 

[00:04:02]

There's one lunch that I love the most, lettuce and cheese on a seven-grain toast. Add a little mustard, put it on a plate, and you have a lunch that's good... No, you have a lunch that's great. Oh, alright! Eh! That's not a valid limerick, Jess. What? I don't understand why it's invalid? Ok, limericks have their own rules and patterns and you have to know those first before you can make a limerick. Why do you know so much about limericks? I don't want to talk about it. I don't want to talk about it right now. I don't want to have anything to do with this Limerick Slam, and I don't want to hear another limerick as long as I live! 
  ??????
Ah, alright, Hector...what is the deal with you and limericks? 
  ??????
It was seven years ago... in this very room. in the days when the Limerick Slam was held in the diner. 
  ??????
It was the Second Annual Limerick Slam... He started to sneeze and lost his cream cheese... And my opponent was Manny Spamboni. 

[00:06:02]


...And never did finish his bagel. Ding! Ding! That limerick is valid! Alright, Manny! That's my little boy. But as good as Manny was, I was better. I was the returning champion and about to win, again. Good Luck, Hector. Hector...this is for the championship. Make up a limerick about the beach. I started my limerick beautifully... I once took a trip to the ocean... But then, I started hearing this awful sound, like a bug, but I didn't see one anywhere. (buzzing) It completely distracted me, I couldn't pay attention to my limerick. (buzzing) The sound distracted me so much that I said the weirdest thing... I am a chicken pot pie. Huh? Eh-Eh! That's not valid! We have a Limerick Slam champ, Manny Spamboni! Woo! (applause) Better luck next year, Hector, you'll certainly need it. (laughing) You're a chicken pot pie. Hey look, I was distracted. Oh come on, Hector, why have you not taken Manny on since then? Yeah, you never give up. I didn't give up, ok, you know, I'm just not that into limericks, ok, they're not my thing. (phone beeping) A message...from Manny. There once was a poet named Jess whose limericks did not impress. She didn't have Hector to come and protect her because Hector was just such a mess. (cackling) 
 

[00:08:04]


 ??????
Ok, that's it. Jess, are you ready to become the next Limerick Slam champion? I am! Good, let's do this thing. Alright! Yeah! 
  ??????
It's time for Electric Sound Off! I'm your host, Hector Ruiz. (cheers) Let's spin the wheel! What sound are we playing with today? Short i, the "i" sound. Let's plug in "i" to see it in action. "i" as in big lid... Or ill inchworm. Or a pig's ship... Is sit a short "i" word? ALL: Yes! Is site a short "i" word? ALL: No! That's right...it has an "I," but it's a long "I" not a short "i." And now, I need two volunteers to go head to head with the "i" sound. I'll do it. I'll do it. Well, come on up! (cheering) Let's see some words! Make a sentence using these words. The person who uses the most words with the "i" sound wins. But be careful, we've hidden some long "I" words on the wall too...ready? BOTH: Ready! Work on your sentences while we hear a word from our sponsor. 
  ??????
Zip...zip...zip... I, Francine Carruthers, am the best zipper-zipper around. For only $300, I'll zip you into your coat, zip you into your shoes. Experience what it's like to be zipped by a true zipper-zipper. 
  ??????
Time's up! Let's see what sentences you made. Well, my sentence is: A kitten in mittens is sitting on a twig. Look at that -- kitten, in, mittens, is, sitting, twig -- six "i" words. You have your work cut out for you, Danny. No problem, my sentence is: A twig on a mitten is behind the nice kitten. You got twig, mitten, is, and kitten -- that's four points. But nice and behind have the "I" sound, not the "i" sound. That means...Jessica wins! (cheering) 

[00:10:04]


What did I win? A big blimp! Wow! I'll see you next time on Electric Sound Off! (beat boxing) 
              ??????
(laughter) We kicked it. Quickly. (laughter) I'm Special Agent Jack Bowser. Chew on this -- I'm stuck, this thing is about to blow, but I can't crack the code to get out. Help me read this... Flick, the famous goldfish, had chicken flavored gum! 
  ??????
(explosions) Ok, so the most important thing about a limerick is that it has its very own structure. Structure, what do you mean? I'm talking about the way that it's built. Like...ok, see that building over there? It has its own structure -- it has the foundation, the walls, the roof. A limerick has its own structure as well. So, how do you build one? Ah, check it out, I'll show you. 

[00:12:07]


Ok...I'm standing here by a brick wall a great place to throw a word ball. I'm teaching you how to limerick now and I hope you remember it all. You see, this the rhyme structure, the first two lines end in a rhyme -- wall and ball. Hmm, and the next two lines end in a rhyme -- how and now. Exactly, and the last line ends in a rhyme with the first two. All rhymes with wall and ball. Exactly, that's the limerick structure, that's how it's built. I can do that, step aside. Ok. I'm a limerick queen, I'm only 13. I know how to rhyme each and every time. See what I mean -- Eh-Eh! That is invalid. I got the rhyme structure right. Yes, you got the rhyme structure right, but the rhythm was off. Oh, Shock, what's up, man? A beat please. (beat boxing) Ok, now listen to the rhythm without the words. 
  ??????
Oh, I get it! I can do that. There once was a limerick queen, a girl at the age of 13. She learned how to rhyme and keep it in time, and now she knows just what you mean. Ding! Ding! That is a valid limerick. Nice! Thanks, Shock. What are you doing here, man? It's beautiful out. Well, well, well, looks like Hector has taught his sister the art of the limerick. It would be a shame if she got...distracted. (buzzing) I have a mechanical bug that lives in a little red jug, it buzzes around distracting with sound, 

[00:14:09]


and for that I will give it a hug. (cackling) 
  ??????
You know what I don't like? I don't like silent letters, I find them really annoying. Like when a B comes after an M, it's dumb, what's the point? I mean, the B's just hanging around there for no reason. I say thumbs down to "mb!" And so, with a stomp I wil flip the "mb" to an "mp." Now see, that P is doing something -- thumps. I can hear that P. Now I can make words like, like stamp...and trample... and bump. Now, I'll take the words climb and crumb and comb and put them in the dump! Oh yeah, I'm pumped! I feel so much better. 
           ??????
Thumbs up to you! Good job. Oh, you're great. You were really good. You're fantastic. You're the best. You're awesome! Thanks, I know. (beat boxing) 

[00:16:09]



        ??????
Alright, stay focused, don't get distracted and your name could be right up there. Limerick Slam Chpion. Yikes, that's a lot of Manny Spamboni's. Don't worry about it, you're ready. Manny, you do your best, you try hard, you play fair. You understand? Of course, Mommy, I always play fair. And one more thing... Uh-huh? Win. 
  ??????
Alright, limerick lovers, are you ready for three rollicking rounds limerick lunacy? (cheering) Alright, you all know the rules...or maybe you don't. You will each compose three limericks on the spot, I will give you a word and you will rhyme it in your limericks, and your limericks must make sense. Should you fail, you will hear this, "Eh-Eh!" Alright, let the limerick slam begin! (cheers and applause) We will start with our reigning champ, Manny. Make up a limerick using the word "poet." (bell ringing) Poet... I'm Manny, the limerick poet, I'm good and boy, do I know it! Some want me to make a great big mistake, but sorry, I'm not gonna blow it. Ding! Ding! That's a valid limerick. (cheering) And now, the challenger, Jessica. 

[00:18:13]


Your word is "dozen." Dozen... I went to the store with my cous to pick up 12 donuts, a dozen. (buzzing) We thought we heard flies, but to our surprise, all that was there was a buzzing. Ding! Ding! That's valid. Time out, time out! That's a new one... ok, I'll allow it. Come over here, what happened? I did hear a buzzing sound and it was really distracting. Buzzing? Yeah, like bzzzz. Ok, ok, go distract everybody for a second, I need to check something out. Distract, right? Yeah, yeah. Um, hey, I want to thank everybody for coming out to the Ninth Annual Limerick Slam, and I want to thank the Electric Diner for sponsoring us... Bingo. Now, how about seven years ago? 
  ??????
Excuse me... good job, Jess. Excuse me, hi... Do you mind if I take Jessica's place in this round? Another new one...let's check with your opponent. Bring it, chicken pot pie! Alright folks, the slam is on with a tag-team twist. Hector, you're up... your word is "hair." 
  ??????
(buzzing) Hair... I just grabbed this thing from the air, that was buzzing around by my hair. It might seem weird but it kind of appeared 

[00:20:13]


that someone was not playing fair! Ding! Ding! That's valid. Give me my bug! Manny, what bug? Well, he's probably referring to the tiny mechanical bug that he's been flying into our ears to distract us. Yeah, that one, give it to me. Manny! Yes, Mommy. What did I tell you about playing fair? Um, that I should do that. We're going home! But, Mommy. No more robotics for a week! Mommy! I guess that means that Jessica is the winner! No, no, wait, wait. I'm sorry, I know I keep doing this. But why don't we have just one more round, fair and square, no bugs, just limericks. What do you say, Manny? Can I, Mommy? Alright, but give me that bug. And...how about we make this one a team round if that's ok? Why not? I pick Jess as my partner. Ok, Manny you choose your partner. He chooses me... let's do this. Alright folks, get ready for the freaky freestyle round. Your limericks can be about anything. We will keep going until someone makes an invalid limerick. 
  ??????
Here we go. There once was a sister and a brother. A pair that could rhyme like no other. Our skills are supreme and we work as a team. Now Manny gets joined by his mother. I cannot believe that you cheated. It's better than being defeated. That's not how you play, that's just not the way. I promise that it won't be repeated. Manny's bug caused a major distraction and his mom, well, she had a reaction. She got really mad and she yelled at the lad. Now let's watch their next interaction. Let's hope that you did learn your lesson. Yes Mommy, I have learned my lesson. Eh-Eh! Oh! What happened? 

[00:22:14]


You rhymed lesson with lesson, you can't rhyme one word with the same word, that's completely invalid. Which means that Jessica and Hector win! (cheering) (sobbing) There, there, Manny, next year. (sobbing) Jessica and Hector Ruiz... Limerick Slam Champions. Hector, I'm glad you're back on the limerick scene. I must say, it is nice to be back. Hey Hector, do you think I could be in the Limerick Slam next year? Ah Keith, what an excellent question. But ease, let me make this suggestion. If you're seeking success take your lessons from Jess, 'cause today, she made quite the impression. Good job. Thank you. Well, look at that, the Electric Company might be able to rhyme, but they won't win this time. On Prankster Planet, no one can stop me. Will you even dare to try, Electric Company? (laughing) 
?????? Prankster Planet! Prankster Planet!

=======================================================


>> Hello, everyone. Kimberly guilfoyle, and this is the 5. More than 24 hours a tornado more tn a mile wide tore through the small town of moore, packing winds of 200 miles per hour. The national weather service upgraded it to an ef-5 twister, the top of the scale. At least 24 people are dead, nine of them children. At this hour rescue crews are searching for more survivors, but the fire chief there says he's 98% sure there are no more survivors or bodies to find under the rubble. Authorities aren't sure how many are still missing. We begin with fox's shepherd smith who made his way to the disaster area toda. Shep? 
>> Reporter: Kimberly, one of the biggest concerns is overcommunications. You mentioned they don't know how many people are missing because they're having such a difficult time talking to each other. Phone lines are down, cell lines are very difficult, although we're able to get texts in and out, but coordinating an effort to find out who should have been where and where those people are now has been virtually impossible. Right now it's up to residents to try to explain to authorities who in their family may be missing, and that's a difficult task as well. Much of the effort today is on salvaging what people can. They're letting some people back into their neighborhoods to get things like medicine and other things that they need and can't purchase. We went into one of with those neighborhoods just to see the destruction this afternoon. This is just on the edge of where the storm hit. As he pans to the right, you'll be able to see what's left around here. See what happened to these trees? Just splintered and twisted and broken away with metal thrown into them. It's like this everywhere you go, that tree over there and house after house after house. There's something left of these. They'll probably have to be torn down. If you pan to the left over there, you'll see where the homes are just obliterated. You can go to any spot in this neighborhood and for blocks and blocks and literally miles and miles, and this is what it looks like. Not isolated damage but widespread with people coming through the neighborhoods trying to find what they can to salvage the day after the storm struck and reality sets in. It's cold, it's lightning,t's windy. A storm has just passed through, and local television stations are warning another hail storm may be on the way. The folks on the porch over here are lucky to hear that there's not going to be a tornado today, not in this area. It's a danger for others that has not passed, but it did rain for hours on end. They were expecting golf ball-sized hail in this particular area. Luckily it didn't come here, but in other areas around oklahoma city, it was a very violent afternoon. Of course, the storms have moved on. The rescue and recovery efforts continue here. Cleanup will go on for weeks, months, I dare say even years as residents come back to see what's left of what was. Kimberly, back to you. 
[00:03:08]



>> All right, shepherd. Thanks. Let's bring in gary england who is the director of meterrology. You've been covering these storms for decades. How do this one compare, and are there any threats in the area today as we speak? 
>> Well, this one, just very quickly I'll tell you, it rates at the top of the scale. MAY 3rd, 1999 HAS ALWAYS BEEN The benchmark we used. This one, the wind speed was extremely high. It was about 1.3 miles wide at the widest. That's is huge. It's extremely powerful, so on a scale to 1 to 10, it was a 10 as far as I'm concerned. As far as risk today, we still have a tornado watch for a little bit of far southeastern oklahoma, but priernlly right now we are getting some flash flooding and a few severe thunderstorms and some hail. I think the main risk of the severe weather and tornadoes is down in texas,n into eastern texas. 
>> Gary, did this take people by surprise? 
>> No. We actually knew two days ahead of time, or at least we thought we knew. In fact, three days ago we figured we were going to have two days of tornadoes. That was the day before yesterday and yesterday, so we were aware the situation would be just ripe for severe thunderstorms and tornadoes. We were well aware, and here in oklahoma, all the television stations, everyone talks about it. We tell them it's coming. We put out graphics saying hey, this is where it will be and what we expect to happen and roughly what time. There should have been no surprise. In oklahoma if you have a radio television or a wireless whatever, you're aware of what's going on. 
>> Gary, this is bob beckel. Let me ask you. This they had a similar or almost as strong a tornado coming through. People must be prepared for this sort of thing, but all these people died. Were people not making continue tin gessee 
-- contingency plans for this. Wouldn't the school have gone into the basement or shelter as opposed to sitting in the halls in the middle of the school, and weren't people who rebuilt after that '99 storm, did they rebuild with a stronger structure or something that made 
-- I know you can't make it tornado-proof but make it less likely that the damage would be as high as it is? 
[00:05:13]



>> Many, many people put in storm shelters and safe rooms after the t of '99. It comes down to money. Do you have the extra money to put it in. Yesterday was the worst possible. I've always thought about if a tornado comes during school time, the parents see the warning and they all run and they try to get to the schools to get the kids, and it was just a bad, bad scenario. With the kids killed in the school, they were, as i understand, they went were they were supposed to go. I don't know whether it was in the hall. One school I think they were in the hall. Not a good place, but probably the best place. The other one I understand they were in the basement. That's where some of the fatalities occurred. 
>> Gary, you said there was a couple days notice. Tell us leading up to the actual tornado going over that school, I think a lot of people are focused in why kids were at risk and lost their lives with the tornado. How much time did that school have and why are kids in hallways and in doorways rather than being in some really, really safe storm enclosure or shelter? 
>> Some of these schools are built years ago. They're just classrooms and halls. They appear what picks to be the safest place. We tell them never to get in a hall that doors that open to the outside. It be tunnel of really bad things. Some of the schools have safe rooms. Some are built partly below ground. This one with all the severe damage apparently wasn't all that saf I'll say the tornado went exactly through it with winds at the core of the tornado over 200 miles an hour. It's difficult to make anything withstand that unless it's a giant safe room. 
>> Gary. I've heard that this has been dubbed the worst tornado in the history of the world. Any insight on weather patterns going forward? Is this something that could be increasing? What does the weather now tell you coming down the pike that the midwest should be prepared for? 
>> Well with, you know, we've had a shift in our weather pattern. We've been cooling somewhat for some time now, so that says the upper air pattern has shifted. We're a little bit colder aloft. That can make you very unstable on the surface. The hotter it is on the surface, the colder it is above, the bigger storms you can have. It's all interrelated. You hear about the el nino and the pdo and all these things are connected. No one has been able to figure it out. I think what we can expect, to answer your question, is more of the same. We'll go through periods where there's hardly anything. In fact, we're in the lowest count of tornadoes since we started keeping records, and that's across the united states. We've had very few tornadoes, and then you get this monster. 
[00:07:51]



>> Gary, what are the hazards that you've got to look out for after this happens? The types of injuries or anything like that that people have to look out for? 
>> Well, what we tell the folks, first of all, when they take shelter, you know, if they don't have a safe room or if they're not below ground, put headlights on, any 
-- put helmets on, any kind of shatter resistant goggles. One of the things after a tornado, they need shoes. The power lines are down. You step on one of those and you're toast. Things are still falling. We had reporters down yesterday in one of our locations and the power poles were still coming down occasionally. So there's just so much to look out for, and it's just absolutely chaos. 
>> Gary, we want to thank you for being with us, gary england, oklahoma news, kwtv. Joining us now is a pediatric trauma medical director of the children's hospital at ou medical center. 59 children have been there since the storm on sunday and two kids are currently in critical condition. Doctor, can you give us an update on what the status is of some of those children, those that are in critical condition, especially? 
>> Both the two that were in critical condition yesterday are still in the icu. I would say that I would upgrade one to fair condition with one still being critical. Both are doing okay. 
>> Doctor, let me ask you. With kids, you know, I keep thinking about this school where the kids were in the hallway and a lot of them were hurt. What is the most dangerous part of a hurricane from a medical standpoint? Is it material blowing through the air? I mean, I understand that some of the material in that town was found 00 miles away. Are kids in a school where there's lots of stuff, desks, chairs, all that. Does that make it more dangerous for them? 
>> I think that being in tornado, no matter where you are, is going to be dangerous, whether it's school or whatnot. We saw 
-- I was here in '99 and we saw far less head injuries this time which are actually the most worry some things. This was mainly extremity injuries, a lot of soft tissue injuries, and so it was more probably flying debris, falling debris, stuff caving in, maybe perhaps, but you know, I would take somebody with a arm over somebody with a 
-- with a broken arm over swmebody with a bad head injury in something like this. 
[00:10:29]



>> Dr. Letton, I guess they're called high velocity injuries that happen during a tornado. Now I understand there's a phase, another phase, a phase two, so to speak, water-related injuries, water-reled illnesses and infections and whatnot. Are you on the lookout for that? Is that a concern? 
>> Yes, and I think also because of the strange infections that one thing we learned from the joplin tornadoes, there were just a lot of different bacteria and even some mold and things in water and in the surrounding area. The kids come in covered in mud. It's amazing. We almost have to give them a bath before we can even tell what's going on, and so we will be watching for infections for the next few days. 
>> Dr. Letton, have you been able to accommodate all of the people that need help? 
>> I'm sorry. 
>> It looks like we may have lost him. Doctor, are you still with me? 
>> You haven't lost me. I've still with you. 
>> Are you able to accommodate the people? I know a hospital was in the path of the tornado, and you probably already had patients there. The influx of patients, and as you mentioned, the second wave. Are you having to send patients to nearby hospitals or other towns or other volunteers coming in? How have you been able to adjust to the situation? 
>> We have not had to turn anybody away so far, and actually, we've called around to other hospitals to make sure that they weren't holding children that needed to come here just because they thought we were overwhelmed. We only had to admit about 20, 25% of the children that came in last night, so once we figured their injuries out and got them addressed, we didn't have to bring everybody into the hospital. We're actually doing okay. 
>> Hey, doc, when you looked at the miles of destruction, were you amazed that it wasn't worse? I mean, did you expect more human suffering? 
>> I really did. I was 
-- again, I was here in '99 doing my fellowship, so i was actually at home when the tornado was coming through. As soon as I saw the tv images, it was so reminiscent of 14 years ago that I came back down, and the whole way in I just had this mindset of how bad it was going to be. Now, we had a lot of kids. We saw over 50, but the degree of the injury was nowhere near as bad, it seemed, as it was 14 years ago, so while I hate that 50 kids showed up at our door, i look the fact that most of them were able to walk away. 
[00:13:04]



>> Doctor very quickly, we don't have a lot of time. A lot of us are scratching our head. The medical examiner last night said 51 fatalities. It was downgraded to 24. How does something like that happen, can you tell us? 
>> I wish I could tell you because I went home, and I was assuming it was 51, too. I heard as high as 20 something children and somewhat distraught that we couldn't do something about it, so I'm actually very happy that this morning it's been downgraded to 24 and only nine, although i wish that nine was zero. 
>> Amen. 
>> Dr. Robert letton, thank you for the work you're doing there. I know it's very tough, especially seeing all those kids coming in injured. He's the director of the medical center at oklahoma city, ou medical center. Thank you so much for being with us. 
>>> And at home, if you would like to help, please call 1-800-redcross and press 4 or you can reach the salvation army at 1-800-salarmy. You can log onto foxnews.Com for more information. We're going to have more on the recovery efforts in oklahoma up next. 
>>> First, when did the white house learn about the irs scandal? The white house keeps changing its story. Jay carney was pressed on that today. 
>>> Also, dramatic testimony from the man who headed the irs while it was targeting conservatives. What did he know? That's coming up. Stay with us. end but a friend under water is something completely different. I met a turtle friend today so, you don't get that very often. It seemed like it was more than happy to have us in his home. So beautiful.

[ Music ] 
>> Kimberly: We have breaking news in the irs scandal. Fox news has learned that lois lerner, the irs official that revealed the agency had been targeting conservatives, will invoke the fifth amendment when she appears tomorrow before the oversight and reform committee. Former irs commissioner douglas shulman testified and it was revealed for the first time his agency targeted tax exempt status. While that was going on, white house spokesman jay carney revealed the white house and the irs had previously discussed how they were going to frame their story to the public. 
>> You're saying there were some preliminary discussions with the white house about the irs issuing an apology through a lois lerner speech. 
>> There were discussions between the treasury chief of staff's office and the office of general counsel and the white house counsels office and chief of staff's office about the timing of this information release and the findings themselves. 
>> So now we know the white house was not only aware of the scandal a month ago but that they seriously considered a preemptive response. As for the president, the white house continues to not only claim that they sat around and included how to message this without telling the president and the president just read about it. Are you buying what carney is trying to sell? 
[00:21:07]



>> This 
-- this administration is as transparent as a behrka. The irs story was supposed to be gee whiz, we didn't know anything about it. We found out it's more choreographed than cats. That question was planted. They had a discussion before they planted that question. It's incredible, and then everybody keeps saying how they don't know. Weren't they supposed to be the best and the brightest? Weren't the republicans supposed to be stupid and the democrats were going to be so smart, but it t they're as dumb, if not dumber than republicans. No one wants to get to the bottom of this because it will bottom of their misdeeds. They just want to push it off. 
>> Lois lerner, kimberly, tomorrow will plead the fifth. 
>> Kimberly: She might not plead the fifth on how she went after the tea party, but the coverup, kimberly, because she's contradicted herself in previous statements. She's lied so many times, and now she says I don't want to talk on the hill. 
>> Kimberly: It's the coverup that will get you. Just ask martha stewyart. That will get you making ponchos in prison. Lois lerner is dead woman walking. She doesn't have anything to hide. Why does she have to take the fifth amendment because guess what? There's criminal activity afoot, people. That's a fox news alert for today, and they are ducking and running for cover. They should. I hope they're diligent and get after this. 
>> Eric, can I ask you about this article in the american spectator? It's been reported that the irs union chief, colleen kelly. 
>> Right. 
>> Met with president obama on MARCH 30th, 2010 IN A Face-to-face meeting. 
>> Even worse. 
>> The day after it looks like they began the irs targeting tea party groups. 
>> According to the inspector general who picked out april 1st as the day they started this process, right. According to the white house logs, miss kelly visited the white house. Now, what did she talk about? By the way, it says visited the president. I don't know. Who else? I'll give you another one. Jack lew who used to be chief of staff tor president obama who now heads the treasurery that oversees the irs. Tyrannical governments see no bounds. If the lap dog media ever gets off president obama 
-- 
[00:23:34]



>> what day did they have the meeting. 
>> MARCH 31st, 2010. 
>> Taking the fifth? I'm not sure she's not just protecting herself. I think lois lerner will take the fifth to protect herself, obviously, or protect maybe the white house or maybe she's afraid of the back lash from the white house if she doesn't. 
>> Bob? 
>> Is your assumption, if i follow your reasoning, as corrupt as it is, that they had this visit and the president of the united states said I want you to get your people to investigate conservative groups? 
>> I didn't put myself in the media. I simply said the head of the irs union, the employees union went to see president obama on MARCH 31st, ACCORDING TO THESE Inspector general of this whole mess. ON APRIL 1st, THE VERY NEXT Day, is the day they started targeting the tea party groups. 
>> The president meets with virtually every ahead of every union in an election year. They went out on strike in a couple places. Does that mean he said go out and strike in these areas? 
>> No, but the day 
-- bob, it starts to smell when the day after they start to target conservative groups and shulman was on the hill today. He said he doesn't believe that he was aware the irs was targeting conservative groups. You made a great point last week. The president should apologize. To shulman today. He was the acting head of the irs. 
>> Can I make a point that the tax policy center, and we know this statistic is true, that 47% do not pay federal taxes, so you hear all this stuff, and when we're doing this story, that means 47%, to them it's like soccer highlights on the news. They just completely tune out. That's why the democratic party needs to have a dependent class because the dependent class relies on the irs as their muscle. 
>> And why not take out the tea party? They're the ones calling to shrink the irs. Of course that I remember in the tawsh they're in crosshairs. 
>>> Directly ahe today tea partiers gathered to protest outside the irs offices across the country. Their story is next on the five.

[ Music ] people Verizon over any other carrier? Many choose us because we have the largest 4GLTE network. Others, because of our reputation for reliability. Or maybe it's because we've received JD Power and Associates' customer service award 4X in a row. In the end, there are countless reasons. But one choi. @@??P Ep??]@ 
[00:29:18]



>> Today tea partyers protested at irs offices across the country. For the media, that has to be awkward. The tea party is like an old dog you drove out to the woods that found its way back. It wands blood. The tea party was never as edgy as occupy wall street, but here they actually earned victim status for real, unlike so many rewarded in the media. How does the press respond? No apologies, no rethink, no. Maybe painting them as racist egged this on and said we get this from the ap, quote, the tea party runs the risk of going too far in its criticism. Yeah. Even when they're victims, they're villains. Just because there is universal agreement that the irs went too far, that should no be misread as acceptance of the tea party's ideology of anger. Thanks, mo. Clearly you are the smartest stooge. I don't get it. What have the tea partyers done with the anger? Have they broken any laws or smash windows, all they did was cher their rights to speak. They didn't spend more time whining than working. Why are they still hated even after they were wronged because they're right? Boy, does the media hate that. The tea party reminds them of their own biases and secret anger, an anger like the kind directed at parents. The tea party at your parents. You hate them for their opinions because you realize they were right all along. Wouldn't it be great if the american media could grow up and do the same? 
[00:31:40]



>> So bob, what did you think of the monologue? 
[ Laughter ] 
>> Greg: You were not listening but writing down numbers for something. Boycott I was writing down numbers to see how long you were going to bore me. 
>> Greg: You did not listen to a single word. .>> I knew that was true. They're planning to sue the irs. What do you make of that? 
>> I think it's the right thing to do on their part. By the way, there's two groups that are helping them sue, one of which is the m maligned around the table, the aclu. 
>> Well, finally stepping up. 
>> Greg: The aclu is suing because they asked to find out if they were being targetd, and you're talking about the doj. Not necessarily the irs. Can I make a point? Remember the tea party got together and pushed back against obama care? Look what we have now. We have the irs about to take over administering obama care, a perfect circle, and the tea party was right from the very beginning to push back from this. This is bad. 
>> Nobody is giving them credit. 
>> Right. 
>> That's the problem. 
>> Hopefully this rebirth, is that a real word? 
>> It could be. 
>> It rebirths the tea party. 
>> It's like high plains drifter returning to the town after he was almost killed. 
>> It should be bigger and stronger now because they have more sympathy from the other siefd the aisle. Now they're not the big bad bullies. Maybe they should make a case to abolish the irs, get rid of it all together. I talked to a woman from the tea party patriots. You would not believe the questions they asked her at the irs. Under the threat of perjury. They said predict in the future the answers to these questions, how much money you'll make. She said andrea, I felt like it was a trap, like I was almost being set up. She said she knows a bunch people who didn't even apply because they said we just give up. We're not applying. Did that have an effect on the election? Well, I think so. 
[00:33:43]



>> Well, first, wait a second. Bob, what do you think about what andrea said? 
>> I think what she talked 
-- 
>> he wasn't listening again. 
>> You have been writing something over there. Kimberly, last word? 
>> Kimberly: Literally last word. Word. I'm going to save you here. I'm you're human parachute, baby. This is why I think everybody should take it seriously even though 47 percent of the people who care are paying the taxes. We've got the dependent state on our back. Nevertheless, they should care about your freedoms, about your first amendments, about being able to make sure that an agency that is so powerful and crushing like the irs is above corruption because what they've done here by targeting americans is not only unconscionable, it's illegal. It's illegal. It shouldn't happen. 
>> Bob, I just want to know. Are we keeping you from something better to do? 
>> If you really want to know, if you guys really want to know. 
>> I do. 
>> I'm trying to make out my taxes because I'm a little late for this year. First of all, you're talkg about the tea party, something i really don't talk about that much. I'm doing it, but listen. This has been a bad enough week for me as it is, all right. Give me a break. 
>> Is he playing soduku, kimberly? 
>> That's amazing. 
>> A lot of numbers. 
>> You have 42 minutes on this show. 
>> That's not what he's doing. 
>> It's not irs. 
>> I guess I better not. 
>> We don't want to know. 
>> He's calculating our ratings which is good. He cares. 
>> Pull the rip cord. 
>> Back to the front lines of yesterday's deadly tornado in oklahoma. Shepherd smith is there. We'll get an update on the relief efforts. Please stay with us. ?????? ??????

And when your hot dog's kosher, that's a hot dog you can trust. Hebrew national. 
[00:39:44]



>> Okay. Let's go back now to moore, oklahoma where shepherd smith has the very latest on the aftermath of yesterday's deadly tornado. Shep, give us a sense. Is there any more indication on the death toll? This number jumps around, 51, 24. We don't know where it is. Why would the medical examiner be so wrong the first time? 
>> Reporter: Well, you know, it's a real good question, eric. It's our understanding that in the chaos of it all, they coununted some people twice. Given my math, they must have counted some people more than twice. I'm not sure how it happened but I can tell you commune cailgt is probably the most difficult thing you can do here. Land lines don't work. In most areas, cells don't work. You can get texts in and out. Emergency workers are using two-way radios to relay information. There's really no clearing house for information, so I guess just a lack of disorganization and probably chaos while officials are trying to figure out how many people were dead. Most people were trying to dig children out of schoolhouses, so I think they were doing the very best they could and trying to provide information when they really didn't have all the information to give and they made mistakes. Thank goodness their mistakes were overestimating, not underestimating. It was great to get off the plane this afternoon, eric, and learn that not as many people had died. I guess in many ways, it's good news. 
>> Kim shepherd, it's kimberly. You had a gentleman on earlier, and thankfully his whole family survived. It was cold out. He didn't have a jacket. You asked him do you have a jacket to put on, and he couldn't find a closet. How is the shelter system, you know, working right now for families in need? 
>> Reporter: From what I've seen in the early going, kimberly, it's working great. As we drove in, the first time today it was raining, there was lightning in the distance. There were people on the sides of the road giving out food and water. There were places set up for people to donate clothing and then people sort through them and get sizes together for people with kids, and there are coats available. You just have to go to the places where they are. Again, it comes down to communication. For that particular bunch, i didn't realize he didn't have a coat and that he was cold. Like look, go left and there's a big trailer set up. They'll get you whatever you want. Any time I've ever covered anything here, kimberly, going back to the oklahoma city bombing and tornadoes since then, these people come out of their houses or what's left of them to donate to people. Folks who don't even have much for themselves, so I'm always inspired coming here in the face of tragedy. That's one thing as journalists that we look for, that triumph over tragedy. I think we see that in this heartland spirit. They're calling themselves oklahoma strong with a nod to the good folks up in the northeast in boston. I think they're living it. 
[00:42:34]



>> All right, shep. We're going to say thank you. Doing some great reporting, shep. The right guy in the right spot. Be sure to tune into the fox report tonight at 7. Shep will have a lot more. 
>>> Now let's check in on the relief efforts in oklahoma. Joining us from moore is a spokeswoman from the red cross. Jennifer, andrea has a question for you. 
>> Jennifer, I understand there's still a number of missing children and missing folks out there. How are the rescue efforts progressing? Have you been able to find some of these children or some of these folks who are missing? Any positive stories to highlight, and if so, what condition are they in? 
>> Well, you know, as far as search and relief efforts, that really lies in the hands of emergency management, and relief workers, and they are out there, out and about. We are supporting them in the incident command center, providing 24-hour food and water, and we are taking those that are affected that are not missing, those in our shelters. We've got two shelters open here in moore, and they're rolling into what I would call emergency aid stations. People are coming and going throughout the day. They're getting a hot meal. They're talking with one of our health counselors, a registered rn or someone of that degree to help fill prescription medications they may be missing, and also just to get information, so it's been one of those days of the ebb and flow in a lot of places. 
>> Jennifer, I was wondering. You look at all this debris, and I'm wondering how long does it take to clear all of this debris, where does the debris go? Who is in charge of this? I mean, I think that has to be a huge issue at this point, right? 
>> Well, you know, I don't want to try to speculate in these early days on how long it will take. I can tell you that this community, there are neighbors coming out who have not been affected who are pitchink in, putting on work gloves and helping families dig through the rubble and try to find pictures and anything else that they can salvage. We saw that a number of times today, and we also found a number of military members that came out in uniform. They just jumped right in as well, people handing out water, so it's certainly the red cross that's responding, but it's not just the red cross. It really takes a community of people and a community of organizations like the salvation army was out here today to come together and prop up this community and get them back on their feet. 
[00:44:57]



>> Jennifer, let me ask you a quick question. Only got a few minutes or a few seconds here. Of all the things you've been involved in with the red cross, how does this rank in terms of disasters? 
>> You know, each disaster is so different. It is incredibly difficult to compare one to the other, so i would hate to weigh one over the other, particularly in this case when so many lives have been lost, and people are still missing. But oklahoma city and the city of moore should know that the red cross is here. We are putting our efforts behind the city to ensure that we've got them covered. 
>> We'll leave it there. Jennifer, thank you very much for the work you're doing. Our prayers and our hearts go out to all you people who are helping out and the families. 
>>> Coming up, the obama administration has been spying on fox news reporters. Chilling details about what they were doing and why. That's next on the five. decisions hire without going to angie's list first. You'll find reviews on home repair to healthcare written by people just like you. With angie's list, I know who to call, and I know the results will be fantastic. Angie's list 
-- reviews you can trust. 
[00:49:50]



[ Music ] 
>> welcome back. The associated press is not the only media outlet that's been targetd by the obama administration. Turns out two fox news reporters, james rosen, and william la jeunesse were also targetd. The justice department sought the espn of rosen's personal e-mails on criminal conspiracy grounds. It was part of an investigation into a story he did in 2009 on north korea. Kimberly,. 
>> Yeah. 
>> What standing does the government have here to investigate some of these private e-mails and a reporter who is doing his job? 
>> Here's what's so interesting about it. He should have been notified when they were going to search his g mail account and read his e-mails and have him followed. You're supposed to let rowsn know and let fox news know. They initially went to one judge who denied the grounds. He said you have to notify them if you're going to do that. Then they went and had another judge overrule it and give them the authority, so they were relentless in their desire and pursuit to infringe on his privacy. This is something that really is unbelievable, and illegal. 
>> Greg, let me ask you a question. The ap investigation had to do with an ongoing investigation into the potential bombing of u.S. Airliner out of yemen. What difference does that make between this one and the yemen thing? 
>> Greg: Well, a, they're calling rosen a co-conspirator. Also, it's north korea. It does involve nuclear weapons. It seems like it was a conversation. The big point for me is there's been a shift in po layerty. Polarity before the obama administration, was us against them. The polarity has disappeared because of all of acquiescence to our countries. The polarity is our government versus those who kansas disagree with our government. We, fox news, is now the enemy. We replaced patriotic enemies with political ones. 
[00:51:51]



>> Do you think rosen will be indicted on conspiracy charges? 
>> They would be foolish to pursue this. 
>> I don't think they will. Everyone needs to know if it can happen to james rosen, it can happen to anybody. This is why it's so darn important that we make you aware of what's going on. 
>> Bob: Andrea, what do you think? 
>> Conspiracy is a very, very serious charge. They're treating him like a spy, like he's part of the kgb for doing his job which is why it doesn't add up, bob. If they want to go after whistleblowers, why not look at the government. Why cast such a wide ned on the ap. Why target reporters like james rosen. They did not take the proper protocols and channels to do this. They're in real trouble. The worst part, a final thought, the ceo of the ap said the worst thing to come out of this, everybody is scared and nobody is talking which is exactly what they want. That is a chilling thing. 
>> Bob: All right. One more thing is up next. 
[ Music ]! Or maybe it's because we've received JD Power and Associates' customer service award 4X in a row. In the end, there are countless reasons. But one choi. called. you. We're not in london, are we? No. Why? Apparently my debit card is. What? I know. Don't worry, we have cancelled your old card. Great. Thank you. In addition to us monitoring your accounts for unusual activity, you could also set up free account alerts. Okay. 
[00:56:38]



[ Female Announcer ]PP AT WELLS FARGO WE'RE Working around the clockpp to help protect your money and financial information. Here's your temporary card. Welcome back. How was london? 
[ Female Announcer ] WHEN PEOPLE TALK, Great things happen. 
>> On a positive note, it's time now for one more thing. Andrea? 
>> Yesterday I was able to interview d rumsfeld on my radio show. He offered some harsh critique and information saying we could have rescued those four americans in benghazi that night. Take a list. 
>> When they were under attack, at that point the tradition in our country and in the military is to step forward and do what you can to try to save the lives. There were forces that could have done something from everything I can tell. In tripoli there was a unit. In italy I believe there was a unit, and someone in that chain of manned said don't do it 
-- of command said don't do and i can't imagine. It's the most unprofessional, unmilitary thing. 
>> I will treat out the full interview, but here's the book, rumsfeld rules. It's awesome. He's such a stud. It's great. 
>> Sorry, bob. 
>> Bob: When you say that, my stomach goes. Go ahead. 
>> Kimberly: Coming out of tragedy, there are often moments that are memorable and heart wrenching. This is one of them. Barbara garcia, a survivor of the massive tornado that struck the oklahoma suburb. She's talking to a reporter for an interview and she's looking for her lost dog. 
>> I hollered for my little dog and didn't answer, he didn't come. I know he's in here somewhere. 
>> The dog. The dog. 
>> Hi, puppy. 
>> Oh. Oh. Oh. Come on. 
>> Oh. God just answered one prayer to let me be okay. 
[00:58:44]



>> Very sweet. 
>> We're running out of time. Very quickly, last night this picture came up from the oklahoma county sheriff. Take a look. That dog was rescued. He's got tags, but a lot of dogs and animals aren't, and they're lost. Go to this facebook page. Facebook.Com/ok pets. If you've lost a dog or found a dog or animal, it's helping everyone out. 
>> The obama administration has opposed the release of the pictures of osama bin laden after he was killed under the reason they don't want to inflame u.S. And islamic tensions. A three-court fed judge ruled in favor of the administration. Therefore, you won't see osama bin laden's pictures. 
>> Osama bin laden. 
>> Thank you. We can't forget the massive explosion that occurred april 17n in west texas. 14 people killed, 200 injured. Willie nelson hasn't forgotten. On his 80th birthday he raised $120,000 which he gave to two towns devastated by the explosion. Well done, willie nelson. 
>> That was a nice willie. 
>> He's always been there. He's been to the farm aid concerts, many of which I went to, some of which I can remember. 
>> What does he say?

=======================================================


>> Shepard: This is the fox report. I'm shepard smith the day after the storm in the middle of neighborhood kings manor and telephone road picking up the pieces, searching for survivors. Team fox coverage begins now. 
>> Shepard: Live now, moore, oklahoma, a suburb of oklahoma city and community in america's heartland that is right now dealing with a disaster on unmanageable scale. Tonight, search crews and search looking for someone buried alive one day after the tornado scraped the landscape raw. Three hours ago the national weather service confirmed what many of us suspected the tornado that hit this city and this area was an ef-56789 the top level possible. That means it carried winds in excess of 200 miles per hour. And you can see what those winds did. Block after block after block. Homes here gone, shredded, crushed, walls and furniture. Photographs. All the ordinary effects of every day life turn to pieces and scattered in the wind after a column of destruction dropped from the sky and chewed a 17-mile path across this city and region. The fire chief here says he is 98% sure that teams from already found all the survivors and victims. He said they are going to hit the streets, search the entire community at least twice more, just to be sure. And oklahoma's governor saying today she still doesn't know how many people are listed as missing. 
>> We know that there are people and bodies that have been taken to the medical examiner's office, but we have also heard that there may be bodies that have been taken to local funeral homes. And so, we are working real hard right now to try to get a more accurate count of the loss of life and we hope to have better numbers on that. 
[00:02:07]



>> Shepard: Right now the medical examiner says at least 24 people are confirmed dead. Nine of those children. Hospital workers also say they have treated more than 200 people so far. More than 70 them kids. Right now, I am standing near what used to be a bowling alley right behind me. About a half mile east of plaza towers elementary school. Before and after images show destruction at that school where seven children died. And where rescuers found others still alive. We have an image of one child who photographer says was calling out for his father as men pulled him from the shattered concrete of that schoo and we have also heard from a grandfather whose daughter and children as plaza towers elementary. She went to get them before the tornado hit. Maybe save their lives. 
>> I don't know what i would have done if I had lost my grand kids. So, I'm proud of her for being smart. She did the right thing. 
>> Shepard: Others who survived this tornado are describing what it was like when it hit. When the wind started blasting in their direction. [Siren] 
>> a lot of rumbling. The thing that got me is when things started hitting the house hard enough to shake the house. 
>> We went under a bridge and took cover under the bridge. We heard the storm. It went right over us and felt the debris. He got hit with some rocks and stuff. But, it was scariest thing that I have ever went through. 
>> It looked like a war zone. It just looked like bombs had been ignited everywhere. It was 
-- there is a car part in my bedroom, you know. Everything is gone, you know. Just in a matter of 30 minutes, your whole life is torn upside down. 
>> Shepard: A lot of people in that same situation. Some as fox reports tonight with nothing left. Shear is a photo of one family's home before the tornado and then after it. That's mary barnhill sitting next to her daughter-in-law brenda. They are in front of brenda's house or what remains of it. Today, americans across this country are trying to help people like brenda and her neighbors. Texas sending an elite search and rescue team about 70 first responders who specialize in getting people out from under wreckage. From the university of new mexico, a 26 member team including doctors and nurses and from joplin, missouri, police and firefighters headed to the scene. Pay back as they put it for the help that community received after its own devastating tornado in 2011. If you would like to help those who have lost so much in oklahoma, the red cross is accepting donations. Can you visit red cross.Org or call 1-800-red cross. This morning president obama spoke from the white house. He told all those affected that their country will be there to help today, and for as long as it takes. 
[00:05:01]



>> There are homes and schools to rebuild businesses and hospitals to reopen there are parents to console. First responders to comfort and of course frightened children who will need our continued love and attention. There are empty spaces where there used to it be living rooms and bedrooms and classrooms. 
>> Shepard: A lot of emptiness here in moore, oklahoma. And a lot of work yet to be done, of course. But this community has faced situations like this in the past. After the tornado that devastated this area an may the 3rd, 1999. So tonight, even as people of moore take stock of all they have lost, as families mourn their dead and comfort the living, we know that they will recover. And they will rebuild. "The fox report's" correspondent jonathan hunt is here with us in moore this evening. Some inspiration out there amid all the loss. 
>> Amazing stories of loss, shep. Amazing stories of survival. And stories of parents having to make unimaginable choices. Today, we came across tracy stephan in her backyard, what used to be her backyard sifting through the wreckage of her home. Yesterday, she was at home when she heard the tornado warnings. She left her2 youngest children there with a friend and rushed to the plaza towers elementary school to try to find her eldest daughter. She was not allowed into that school. The doors were already locked. She then had to choose whether to stay there, close to her eldest daughter or rush home to her two youngest children. Listen. Honestly I felt like I had to pick and choose staying at the school with one child or coming back home to my two other children. It's a tough decision i don't want to go through again. 
>> Tracy chose to come home to her two youngest children. She hid with them in the cellar. Then, when the tornado had passed, she rushed back to the school, desperately trying to find her eldest daughter. Listen again. 
[00:07:07]



>> Were saved her life. She hovered over her during the whole time, such selfless act. She ended up needing to seek medical attention because she had cuts and scrapsz and was bleeding. Saved my daughter's life. 
>> You can explain that moment when you first saw your daughter; the happiest day of my life. It was amazing. Being able to see her and she is okay. And she was excited that there was no more school. 
>> Tracy's daughter excited that there was no more school and, tracy's daughter saved by the action, shep, of that heroic teacher's aide who just covered her up and saved her from almost certain death. 
>> Amazing stories coming from so many places. Jonathan thanks very much. For a while, most of the images we got were from above. This afternoon the weather was so bad here in moore, oklahoma. They were not tornado warnings but severe warnings. Warnings of large size hail. Thankfully that didn't happen. The rains came and all the choppers came out of air. Our friends at wtov and kotv have put their chopper back up in the air and we're able to get live pictures now. We are showing you the destruction around this area as we speak. Of course, there are lots of ways to help the people here in oklahoma and across the region. We have a couple perform options. Can you donated to the red cross if you like or the salvation army, of course, online or by phone. We have moore information at our web site. It's very easy. Just go to foxnews.Com/shem and it's all there for you. After yesterday's tornado, a photographer took a picture near the plaza towers elementary school and today it appears on the covers of newspapers from california to florida and beyond. A woman carrying a child through a field. We don't know their names or what's become of them, frankly, but we'll have more on the scene at plaza towers elementary coming up inside fox report. We'll also hear from some of those who have been taking part in the massive search and rescue operation. 
[00:09:14]



>> A lot of people are just very sad. I mean, as can you imagine, having to pull anybody whether it be children or adults is just going to be overwhelming for a person. So, you know, at this point, when it went from a certain and rescue to search and recovery. The mood over there has definitely changed. 
>> That and continuing coverage of the disaster in the heartland. Coming up from the journalists of fox news on this tuesday fox report, live from moore, oklahoma. Oklahoma strong. We learned a lot of us have known someone who's lived well into their 90s. And that's a great thing. But even though we're living longer, one thing that hasn't changed much is the official retirement age. ?????? ?????? the question is how do you make sure you have the money you need to enjoy all of these years. ?????? ?????? What makes the Sleep Number store different? You walk into a conventional mattress store, it's really not about you. They say, "Well, if you wanted a firm bed you can lie on one of those. We provide the exact individualization that your body needs. Oh, yeah! Wow. Once you experience it, there's no going back.

[ Female Announcer ]PP AT WELLS FARGO WE'RE Working around the clockpp to help protect your money and financial information. Here's your temporary card. Welcome back. How was london? 
[ Female Announcer ] WHEN PEOPLE TALK, Great things happen. 
>> Shepard: The pictures you see on the other side of the screen from kotv 
-- let's see, from kwtv and kotv our news affiliates who have their dhoppers up live tonight. We will be showing you the devastation and cleanup as the newscbst continues. Tonight we are hearing from relatives of children who survived the tornado's direct hit on that school plaza elementary as i reported at the top of this newscast, officials tell us at least seven children died in that school. But rescue workers did manage to pull some of the kids out of the rubble forming a human chain to pass them to safety. Today on "studio b" I spoke with a man whose 6-year-old daughter made it out of that school alive. 
>> She was a little freaked out o. She said that the school fell down. And she got a couple scrapes and scratches. Nothing too serious. Doesn't quite understand why it happened to us. But she is happy that we are all fine and her dog is fine. So she is actually quite happy about it that we are all okay. 
>> Shepard: They are all okay. This is what is left of their house. Justin told me he was at work when the tornado hit. His wife and two children rode out othe storm in a neighbor's basement. He also told me he is not wearing a jacket today because he couldn't find his closet. He has since gone to shelters and gotten a new one but john roberts is at plaza towers elementary tonight or was earlier today and is he live here in moore tonight. John, what's the latest on that school. Do we know? 
>> There is a small piece of good news, shep. If there is any good news in this disaster. Is the fact that for about 17 or 18 hours, it was believed as many as two dozen children have been trapped in parish in addition to the seven you mentioned elementary school it appears now that was simply the fog of confusion following the initial strike of the tornado. Rescue workers went through a elementar school a number of times today and did not find any more victims. The death toll holding steady now at 24. It sti could rise but at least we believe now 24 additional children did not die. We're also learning a little more about what happened inside that school in briar wood elementary from an a.P. Story that came out just a little while ago. As the storm warnings went out, those tornado warnings all the children were taken out of their classrooms at plaza tower, sent to the calf fear I can't to wait for their parents to pick them up. But when the tornado sirens went off, school officials scrambled to get them all into the hallway an area they thought would be a safe place. But one teacher at plaza towers said this hallway is not safe. She grabbed a bunch of kids and took them into the bathroom. When the t. Hit the children survived. Similar tore the children took them into the hallway it's not safe. Took them a few of them and went into the closet. That's one of the reasons why none of the children at briar wood perished. We should point out, shep, neither briar wood nor plaza towers had any kind of safe room or hardened tornado shelter. The students simply had the structure to protect them. We saw how well that did during this tornado. 
[00:16:00]



>> Shepard: Because of all of that, john, it's my understanding you met aan whose daughter really didn't trust that the schools could be safe in the storm. 
>> Fellow who lives just across the street, his name is jim garner. He said that yesterday afternoon his daughter, who has four kids at plaza towers elementary got a hinky feeling about everything that was going to happen. He picks up the time line from there. She knew this was coming. She had a bad feeling. So she went to the school and picked my grand kids up from school. 
>> What time was that at. 
>> Around 2:00. 
>> The storm hit at the 2:59? 
>> Yes, sir. She made a good decision. She went and got them out of school and brought them home. 
>> 
>> brought them home and took them immediately to the underground tornado shelter right behind their house. She added six more children. Jim garner, his daughter and 10 children rode out this tornado in underground storm shelter, shep. They all escaped unscathed. Though jim told me he had to hold on to that door because it felt like the tornado was trying to suck it open and suck them out. Shep? 
>> Shepard: Man, john roberts live here in moore with us tonight in oklahoma. Lawmakers from this area say help is really already pouring in from across the country and for that matter around the world. President obama says is he taking steps to speed disaster relief from washington. We'll get a live report from the white house. But, first, shear look at some of what I saw earlier today just after we landed in moore, oklahoma. 24 hours later, and you could take this camera to any place within miles away and find something exactly like this. See the side of this house here? Covered in mud. The tornado threw it up against the house. Beams coming down, metal in the trees. All along here, debris from we don't even know where. These are either power lines and somebody's gas can. And over here you can see the rest that was done by the storm. That's a tree there in the the center that was a tree. And now roof after roof is gone. People have come in to try to get some of their things today. And this is right on the corner near the big medical center that you heard about yesterday. Stay right there, scott, so you you can see it back behind you. This is the medical center over here. It just wiped out. You can see this was the main entrance. The woman center and back behind, just what's left of this facility. And as scott walks over to his left, you will be able to see in the distance there car after car, scott, pan to the right, and it is as if the tornado just picked all of these cars up and just pushed them into this building. You see the x's on the side of these vehicles, right? An x means that they have searched the vehicle and there is nobody inside. By the thousands part-time have come here. To try to vool tier. And over here, an american flag is up. It's oklahoma. It's the heartland of america. They have been through this before. A devastating storm in 1999. The devastating alfred t. Murrow federal building bombing. Another horrible storm in 2003. And now they are at it again. And each time they have been an inspiration to the naon. As they come in with a shopping cart with what they have been able to salvage from their home, a reminder of each single individual's struggle and the struggle that will go on for months and months to come. Oklahoma needs your prayers and your help. to take a centrum silver multivitamin every day. I told him, sure. Can't hurt, right? And now today, I see this in the news.

>> Shepard: President obama is praising the heros here in the heartland and promising that the federal government will do everything it can to help. He says he has already signed a disaster declaration to get things moving right away. 
>> Our prayers are with the people of oklahoma today. Our gratitude is with the teachers who gave their all to shield their children with the neighbors, first responders and emergency perch nell to ho raced to help as soon as the tornado passed. And with all of those who as darkness fell searched for survivors through the night tent the flag on capitol hill is still flying at half-staff in honor of the victims in oklahoma. Ed henry live at the white house tonight. Ed? 
>> Shep, it's interesting before the president made comments at the white house he had a high level briefing with some of the advisors including janet napolitano. You can see the official white house photo of that, lisa monica. One of the other advisors there. You remember she was pivotal in the boston bombing investigation as well in terms of keeping the president in the loop about the latest development. And the president made clear that the full force of the federal government will be on hand in oklahoma to deal with this tragedy. Take a listen. 
>> Neighborhoods were destroyed. Dozens of people lost their lives. Many more were injured. And among the victims were young children trying to take shelter in the safest place they knew, their school. 
>> Interesting as well because craig fugate was not in this briefing with the president only because he was already on his way to oklahoma. So his deputy was here to help brief the president, the homeland security secretary janet napolitano is now on her way as well. She will be in oklahoma where you are tomorrow, shep. Meanwhile, in terms of the president, we don't know yet when he will go. But white house officials are saying privately that likely go at some point but right now, publicly, they are saying he does not want to get in the way of all the first responders trying to, you know, bring everyone together, try in that recovery mission to deal with everyone on the ground. The last thing you want to do is bring the president's security detail in and distract from all of that, shep. We won't see him for at least a couple days. 
[00:25:06]



>> Shepard: They couldn't take much more traffic congestion here for sure. Ed henry at the white house. There have been many stories of families who rode out this tornado in their underground storm shelters. Earlier today our casey stegall went out into one of those small spaces and got a sense of what it might have been like for people to climb back out only to find heir homes were I don't know if gone. 
>> In oklahoma, these are common in the homes. They are just a little space and you have luggage in here. Some bottled water. Maybe your radio weather radio, a flash light. Look at this. This is the garage. You can see that's what's left of the home. 
>> Shepard: Piles of debris all around. The fear is some homes may have collapsed on top of those storm shelters and the fear is some people could still be trapped. So they are feverishly searching. Come coming up a live report from the disaster scene and word on the cost of this devastation. First, we are tracking threats of more severe weather rig now. Our meteorologist janice dean in the fox extreme weather center live back in new york. Janice? 
>> Hi, shepard, yes. We still have arkansas, louisiana, mississippi, up towards tennessee and kentucky. And several severe thunderstorm warnings just east of dallas. North and east of austin, moving in towards the carolinas. Georgia, tennessee, and kentucky, each the northeast we are seeing many severe thunderstorm warnings. So something we are going to track throughout the evening. There is your severe risk in the yellow with that red shaded area where we still think we could have the potential for hail, damaging winds and even tornadoes. The good news is sty skies are clearing in moore, oklahoma. More coverage with shepard smith live from moore, killing that bacteria yesterday, just flaunting it? And did you see the magic eraser clean up that crazy kitchen mess? It was like super dirty, super clean. How? Wish I hadn't.

[00:30:30]



>> Shepard: I'm shepard smith. It's "the fox report." It's the bottom of the hour, time for the top of the news from moore oklahoma. The community here will rebuild. It will never be the same. There is nothing left to repair. Nothing for families to salvage. Instead, they are having t clear everything out and frankly start from scratch. Just watch here as one family confronted the brutal realty they recorded the moment that they emerged from their underground storm shelter, everything they own in a pile of rubble. Right where their home had been. Not a single structure standing as far as the camera could see. We cannot measure of human cost of this tragedy yet. But the damage to homes and businesses could be in the billions of dollars. In fact, oklahoma's insurance commissioner predicts it will top the $3 billion in damage from the job palestinian, missouri storm a couple of years ago. Today we spoke with a woman who went to joplin back then to help. She says she remembers vividly those heart broken survivors now she is one of them. 
>> I'm from kansas originally. So friends and I went over and we just helped pass out water and we helped people go through homes and get what they could and, you know, you always pray and hope that it's never you. And I hoped it wasn't us but, unfortunately, unfortunately it was. 
>> Shepard: That woman spent the day climbing through the wreckage of her home searching for her dog. Her put was in a back room when the twister hit. She says the entire room vanished, dog and all. Casey stegall spoke today with thaoman and many of the other victims. Casey, what are you seeing there where you are? 
>> Well, shepard, you know, when we started our day this morning, it was a member of your own team who said hey where are you located? I looked around and I was trying to figure out where to tell them to go and i realized I was looking in the wrong spot to tell them we were at heather lane and southwest sixth street. Shepard, on the outside today was about sifting through the rubble it was about picking through the pieces and cleaning up. But on thenside, it was about something else all together it was about hope. Hope that more survivors would be found and hope that the death toll wouldn't rise and that is exactly embodied right back there. Look at that a powerful image, a tattered american flag hanging. The homeowner there says that his wife and two children rode the storm out in their bathtub. They are okay. He said he wanted to hang that flag there as a reminder that neighbors are helping thy neighbor and this community will rebuild. We also were here this morning when this perimeter was unsealed and they let the residents in for the very first time and we were with this woman when she saw everything firsthand everything I know, I rode my street, my bike through this street. These are my friends houses. I used to take the bus route around here and now, I don't know, just really sad and scary and it's going to take so long to rebuild. 
[00:33:43]



>> But they will rebuild. We have seen it done elsewhere. And we will see it here. It will take some time but we will get there. Shep? 
>> Shepard: Yeah, it certainly will take some time. Casey stegall in the middle of it all. Casey, thanks. Disaster relief is well underway here. Salvation army officials say that they have dispatched response teams and set up mobile food stations to get really whatever they can to the victims. The red cross sending similar help to the area. It's also created a web site so if you want to connect with people searching for loved ones in the wake of the storm, you can. If you want to go to go to safe and well.Org. Enter your information and list yourself as safe and you can check with people who have registered as well. People are helping out in shelters. Our alicia acuna is live in one of the moore community center which is the shelter for everybody here tonight. How is it going alicia. 
>> How is it going, shepard. Some are coming here to sleep some to rest. If you take a look, this is where a lot of folks are dropping off supplies. This is something that has been going on all day. Folks trying to help out any way they can. Now, the red cross says that a lot of people actually prefer to stay with family and friends. But, still, the university of oklahoma is on summer break and it says that it is opening up its dorms to displaced families, also. And today a huge celebrity here. Ou head football coach bob stucks brought stacks of $50 gift cards and decided to come here and visit with the families at this shelter. A little relief and brought a bunch of hats and t-shirts and some dry wear for people who have been out all day and trying to pass them out. And help them a little bit. 
>> As part of the healing process here, some of the kids were allowed to get back to being kids. Art supplies provided to the youngest who were kicked from their homes by that tornado. So, shep, they got to color, which is good for everyone here to see. Shep? 
[00:35:47]



>> Shepard: Coloring is always fun. We have got a couple here with us you will neat a second who love it as well. Chris cathy's family was in the middle of the chaos and destruction. The home they had been rent something now leveled. One of chris' children is a kindergartner at plaza towers elementary. The school where the tornado 
-- well, the tornado the school tornado flattened. Chris and cory and his son cash are all with us tonight. How are you guys doing? 
>> Pretty good. 
>> I mean, now, it's my understanding, cory, you were in school, right? Were you? I know hello kitty is much more interesting than me. I understand. This I was just wondering, how is she doing there? 
>> She said she wasn't scared but I know it was probably a different story in there I wasn't there. I was about an hour away and rushing to get there. I'm sure she was pretty shaken up. She was shaken up when i saw her. 
>> Shepard: Is she always quiet or doesn't like television life. 
>> She is very shy. 
>> What about you, cash? I don't think 
-- these are the only children in the world that don't talk. You are a very lucky man. In all seriousness though, did you lose everything? 
>> Pretty much. Pretty much everything. We have salvaged some pictures and some clothes and everything else I just count it as a loss. 
>> What do you plan to do? 
>> Just rebuild everything is replaceable but these two. 
>> We are showing pictures what's left of your house. It's just unbelievable. It's something to see. I didn't expect it to be that bad. 
>> Now, cory's teacher is in the hospital, right, with an arm injury. 
>> Right. 
>> What happened to her? 
>> I'm not sure. I guess the walls caved in where they were and they told me something had landed on her arm. I don't know how bad it is yet. 
>> Have you been able to think about not just what tomorrow brings but about what the next weeks and months bring? 
>> I haven't been able to think of much. I'm just trying to get a plan together. I haven't give it much future thought yet. 
>> I guess today is hard enough. 
>> Right. It's too soon. 
>> Where are you staying and cash needs a hug. 
[00:37:52]



>> We are staying in a hotel on north meridian. We will be there for a while until I figure everything out. 
>> Have you and your neighbors been able to get what you need? 
>> So far. So far we have been blessed. Everybody has been helping out. Families came down. Been lety good. 
>> Your kids seem so tired. I understand how they would be. That rain today and cold and really draining. 
>> Yeah, it's taken a lot on them. Wore them out a little bit. 
>> Have they seemed okay? Cash are do you go good? Yeah, all right. We got a nod out of him anyway and a very cool snugy. Were these things donated? 
>> Yeah. They were donated. Her cousin had came down and brother and they brought some supplies. 
>> Shepard: Y'all have people to stay with and some support around you? 
>> Yeah. We have some support. My grandparents live up here. 
>> Shepard: You are lucky that way. Cash, I think you need it a nap, don't you, cash and cory, and chris, you need some shoes too, babe. She left them in the car. Not that they are shoeless. Good luck to you guys. I hope everything goes well. 
>> We appreciate it really do. 
>> Shepard: If they decide to talk give us a call we would love to chat with them. 
>> All right. Thank you. 
>> Shepard: Oh, my goodness. Mighty tough for all these families. It's one thing you keep your kids in a routine and every day you want to eat at this time. And you go to the bus at this time. We are going to go to bed at that time. All routines are out the door. And children are a lot of work for a lot of folks around here now. Much more ahead from oklahoma. We'll bring you the breaking details as they come in. Plus, we're following other big stories today. Including the trial of jodi arias who spoke out today in court.

[00:43:23]



>> Shepard: Back live in move, oklahoma with more on the killer tornado in the heartland. First, jurors have began deliberating with jodi arias gets life or death after she revealed today that she no longer wants to die or so she says is. She now says she wants life in prison. 
>> Until very recently, i could not have managed standing before you all and asking you to give me life. To me, life in prison was the most unappealing outcome I could possibly think of. I thought I would rather die. But as I stand here now, i can't in good conscience ask to you sentence me to death. 
>> Shepard: Of course that's not what she told our station fox 10 in phoenix just hours after the jury found her guilty of murder in the first degree, after she stabbed her ex-boyfriend 27 times, shot him and slit his throat. At that time she called death the ultimate freedom but today she told the jury she has more perspective now about the positive change she can make in prison. 
>> I designed a t-shirt. This is the t-shirt. Which 100% of the proceeds go to support nonprofit organizations, which also is other victims of domestic violence. 
>> Shepard: Remember, areas and the defense did not present much evidence to support the claim that she herself was a victim of domestic violence. There was no physical evidence at all. Today she said that people that don't believe her are entitled to their opinions. She also showed off some of her after the 
-- artwork drawings of frank sinatra, elvis presley and elizabeth taylor. Jodi arias says as it stands she will never create another oil painting in her life and we are now about to hear even more from this, woman because she has agreed to interviews with major television networks, including fox later tonight. Trace gallagher live in the west coast news hub. Maybe this will be the last of it. Jury has the case again, shep. They delivered it for an hour and hour and a half. 15 minutes ago 10:00 local. 1:00 in the east. Experts do not believe these deliberations didn't last very long. Remember, during the guilt phase deliberated 15 hours. During the aggravating phase they only deliberated for an hour and a half. Here now is a sample of the closing arguments from both sides. 
[00:45:49]



>> All of this is being presented to you during this phase of the proceedings. Most of it has come from the defendant's mouth. This individual that will not hesitate when the truth fails to come up with a lie. 
>> But lying is not a capital crime. And lying does not give you the death penalty and lying isn't even an ago aggravating factor. 
>> If she gets life, she goes back to the maricopa county jail for a short time and then to prison. If she gets death. She goes directly to death row, shep. 
>> Shepard: Well, she has perspective now, trace. If I if I fill us in on all this perspective. 
>> Yeah, she said that if she asked for the death penalty it would be like committing suicide and that would be extremely painful for her family and she says her family has been through enough pain. She says if she gets life in prison, she would teach inmates spanish, even sign language. Maybe even start up a book club. She says the time for healing has begun. Listen. 
>> This is the worst mistake of my life. The worst thing I have ever done. It's the worst thing I ever could have seen myself doing. In fact, I couldn't see myself doing it before that day I wouldn't even want to harm a spider. 
>> You could see jodi arias was clearly nervous as she was reading that statement. The family of travis alexander sat in the background motionless. Jodi arias will speak with fox tonight 9:30 local time and we will air parts of that interview tomorrow. Shep? 
>> Shepard: With the fox broadcast network or fox news channel or what? 
>> She is interviewing with local fox as well as fox news channel tonight at 9:30. So we will have that on tape. Bring it back to the truck, feed it and it can be broadcast any time after 11:00 tonight local. 
>> Shepard: I'm sure life won't be complete without it trace gallagher live in los angeles. Thank you. There is a new development not justice department's seizure of journalist records including the personal information of fox news correspondent. That straight ahead. And back here in moore, a community dealing with tremendous shock and grief. But amid the death and destruction a symbol of strength.

>> Shepard: We're learning more abobout how the feds targeted a fox news correspondent as part of a leak investigation. As it turns out, the feds didn't just access james rosen's personal email, his g mail account, they also got ahold of his phone records. Shannon bream live in the d.C. Newsroom tonight. Shannon? 
>> Well, shepard, personal emails and phone records and we are learning tonight they go far beyond just james rosen's information. In a court filing made by the u.S. Attorney's office dated october 13th, 2011 the government details numerous pieces of evidence that had t. Has collected including scores of phone records that have area codes and exchanges that match up to many fox news office hard lines and employee's cell phones. In the redacted version of that government we cannot see the final four numbers in each of the phone numbers but the area code and exchange match up to fox employee and the office phones including the phone lines that run to our work space at the white house, pentagon, and state department. The records also appear to show the justice department gathered phone records linked to fox news executives. We have reached out to the justice department and white house for comment. White house press secretary jay carney tells our colleague ed henry he quote can't comment on ongoing criminal investigation. These new revelations come on the heels of news that an fbi agent signed an affidavit accusing rosen of committing a crime by allegedly obtaining information from a state department employee and that led to a search warrant that gave the government access to rosen's personal email account. Shep? 
>> Shepard: Shannon, the man that was running the irs when it targeted conservative groups is refusing to apologize to those groups. The former commissioner douglas shullman testified about the scandal on capitol hill for the first time today. He he says is he deeply saddened by what happened but insists is he not to blame. I'm certainly not responsible for forming a list that had inappropriate material on it when that said it happened on my watch and I'm it happened on my watch. 
[00:53:36]

=======================================================

NARRATOR: March, 1945. After nine months of bitter fighting, the Allies have driven the Germans across Europe to the Rhine River, the last natural barrier to the German heartland. It is here that Allied generals expect the battered remnants of Hitler's once-proud army to mount their final defense of the fatherland. Because the Germans had said, "The Rhine River is going to run red with American blood." And they meant it. NARRATOR: German reconnaissance planes take to the sky to pinpoint where the Allies will attack. Across the river from Dusseldorf, the view from the air reveals hundreds of American vehicles. Intercepted Allied radio transmissions confirm the presence of two American divisions. German observation posts hear them moving in across the river. All signs suggest the attack will come here. But the tanks spotted from the air are 93-pound inflatable dummies. The sounds come from loudspeakers, the radio transmissions from a script. It's amazing, the fakery that we were able to perpetrate upon the enemy. NARRATOR: A group of handpicked soldiers waging a secret war of deception was now trying to pull off one last grand illusion, with thousands of American lives hanging in the balance-- including their own. 
[00:02:08]


DICK SYRACUSE: I used to refer to us as the Cecil B. DeMille Warriors. NARRATOR: These artists of deception were also known as the Ghost Army. Additional funding provided by these donors, and many others. NARRATOR: In the fall of 1943, American GIs were pouring into Great Britain for the upcoming invasion of France, and a handful of U.S. Army planners in London was exploring how to use deception to give those soldiers an extra edge when they came face to face with the full fury of Hitler's Wehrmacht. WESLEY CLARK: To win on the battlefield, you would like every advantage. One of the key advantages in warfare is surprise. ception is intended to create surprise in the enemy. NARRATOR: On Christmas Eve, 1943, a memo was sent from London to Washington, requesting the creation of a top-secret "field deception unit" in time for the upcoming invasion. The mission was to try to be able to take a thousand men and put 'em in so that 15,000 men could move somewhere else and not be detected. We were going to be in show business, where we set up one-night stands and, like ghosts, disappear. NARRATOR: Allied Commander Dwight Eisenhower ordered that the new unit, officially known as the 23rd Headquarters Special Troops, be given the highest possible priority. Eisenhower believed that deception could prove to be one of his most potent weapons. 
[00:04:25]


CLARK: When people think of war, they think of the infantryman with the bayonet. They think of the tank, the artilleryman pulling the lanyard and the flash and roar of the cannon. But the essence of winning is the defeat of the enemy's plan and the imposition of your will upon the enemy. And to do that requires creativity and deception. NARRATOR: The 23rd would employ three types of deception to con the Germans: visual, sonic, and radio. To carry out visual deception, the Army selected a 350-man camouflage battalion heavily loaded with artists. JOHN JARVIE: We want somebody to tell us what something is going to look like from up in the air, and we're down here, we need artists who are pretty good at concept. They can imagine it. And they imagine it pretty well. NARRATOR: The Army drew heavily from New York and Philadelphia art schools to create the 603rd Camouflage Engineers. JARVIE: And I had to write to this unit because I knew they were open, but you had to write to them and they had to accept you. It had nothing to do with the Army draft at all. NARRATOR: In early 1942, they began exploring the ins and outs of tricking the eye. One of their most ambitious projects was to camouflage the plant in Baltimore where B-26 bombers were made, to protect against the possibility of German air raids. Our outfit was responsible for disguising that and covering it, so from the air it looked like it was the countryside. 
[00:06:25]


NARRATOR: In stolen moments and off hours, the artists in the unit painted and sketched. The 603rd became an incubator for young artists. DOWD: I did hundreds of drawings. It isn't as though we weren't busy. But you have to realize, no matter how busy a soldier is, there's alwaysown time. Soldiers are playing cards, they're shooting craps. And I drew. I just developed the habit, and I don't think it's ever left me. NARRATOR: Fewer than half the soldiers in the 603rd were artists. The rest came from all walks of life. One art student from Brooklyn, Jack Masey, was so dazzled by the diversity of the men in his company, he set out to caricature every one of them. They were either cops, they were shoe salesmen. There were bartenders, there were students. It was a wild array of all kinds of people. I'd only known Brooklynites or Manhattanites. Now, suddenly, I was thrown into another world. I was intrigued by this world. And we were looked on as kind of nutcases by the hardworking, no-nonsense, backbone of America, the people that worked for a living and didn't sketch. We were looked upon as slightly freakish, I think. And I think we probably were. NARRATOR: In early 1944, these camouflage artists were selected to be part of the Ghost Army. Instead of trying to hide things, they were now going to be in the risky business of drawing attention to themselves. GIL SELTZER: At which point somebody said, "You mean we're asking for the enemy to fire on us?" The answer was yes. At that point we all came to the conclusion that this was a suicide outfit. 
[00:08:44]


NARRATOR: Their new assignment was to use decoy tanks and artillery to conjure up make-believe battalions. The concept was so out-of-the- box that the Army had no "book" for them to go by, and, at first, no decoys to work with. They improvised, fabricating dummy tanks out of wood and canvas, and teaching themselves to be deceivers. Meantime, in the California desert, the Army was testing different kinds of decoys for possible Ghost Army use. One type consisted of a collapsibleetal frame covered in fabric. When mounted on a jeep, it could become a mobile decoy. Despite this advantage, the frames proved heavy, difficult to set up, and prone to breakage. The Army decided instead to go with inflatable dummies made out of rubber. MASEY: It was a little bundle of stuff-- which a tank was in-- all compressed before you opened the bundle, spread the nozzles around, and inflated it. HARRIS: Pulling this amorphic shape out of it, and then watching it being filled with air and taking form, you know, like a monster. MASEY: If things went very well, there were air compressors. If things went not so well, there were bicycle pumps. And, if things went terr badly, there were our lungs. JOE SPENCE: In most cases, like a Sherman tank, we could have it inflated and moved within 15 or 20 minutes. SPIKE BERRY: The artillery piece was good, the jeep was good. But that M4 tank, that was a buty. That was a piece of work, really was. 
[00:10:56]


NARRATOR: As the camoufleurs came to grips with their strange new job, another unit picked for the Ghost Army was learni about a brand new kind of warfare: sonic warfare. JACK McGLYNN: I was interviewed for a top-secret organization, which was involved in psychological warfare and something to do with sound. I thought, sound, we were going to zap all the Germans. We'd end the war and that would be it. But it was more psychology than zapping. NARRATOR: Using sound to fool the enemy was a new idea in World War II, made possible by technology that didn't exist a few years earlier. The Army set up its sonic warfare program under another officer who had been a prominent personality before the war: Hilton Howell Railey. McGLYNN: He was the father of the whole sonic project. He had been a newspaper man, then he became a military man. NARRATOR: Most notably, Railey was the PR man who recruited Amelia Earhart to become the first woman to fly the Atlantic, launching her to international fame. SYRACUSE: I can remember so well his greeting to me was, "Lieutenant, the mission of your company will be to draw enemy fire." I suggested that as a kid from the Bronx, I said, "I certainly respect the role that we have to play, "but I reserve the right to kick a little ass myself if I get the opportunity." And he roared. NARRATOR: In early 1944, Railey sent a team with a portable audio studio down to the Army proving ground at Fort Knox, Kentucky. Working with experts from Bell Labs, they spent three weeks recording sounds onto 16-inch transcription disks, the samed used to make hit records. 
[00:13:08]


SYRACUSE: The recordings were brilliant. I mean, if there was a road leading up, the music had to be described-- (making rumbling sounds) The changing gears, tanks going up, tanks going down, tanks assembling. McGLYNN: Then we would go to anther spot where trucks were just flying through on the highway. HAROLD FLINN: They had recordings of building a pontoon bridge or any type of bridge, and you could hear 'em hammering away and swearing. NARRATOR: Different sounds could then be cued up on different turntables and mixed together to create whatever scenario was required-- one of the earliest known uses of multitrack recording. And this is all recorded on a wire. Remember, back there, there was no tape. NARRATOR: The wire recorder was advanced technology in the 1940s. A single spool contained two miles of magnetized wire, enough for 30 minutes of sound. And unlike a record, it was never going to skip. The recordings were played over 500-pound speakers with a range of 15 miles. ALBRECHT: Back of my half-track, I tell my children, was the biggest boom box you ever saw, but it played sounds of tanks and activity. NARRATOR: Rounding out the corps of deceivers were the radio operators of the Signal Company Special. Now when you think of the 23rd Special Troops, you think of the inflatable tank, or the sound guys, and they're great. But they have to have a stage on which to perform. And we provided that stage. NARRATOR: By some estimates, German army units gathered as much as 75% of their intelligence from radio intercepts. Convincing radio transmissions could attract enemy attention the way a red flag attracts a bull. 
[00:15:13]


JON GAWNE: The British had captured an entire German radio interception unit. And they were able to see that the Germans could very precisely pinpoint Allied units from their radio transmissions. And they were actually quite stunned at how good the Germans were at this. NARRATOR: To fool the Germans, more than 100 skilled radio operators were plucked from units around the country. Stan Nance was on desert maneuvers with the 11th armored when a stranger in a jeep came looking for him. He said, "Get your equipment and come with me." And I just said, "Where are you going?" And said, "All I can tell you "is that I'm not supposed to tell you anything, and for you to shut up." NARRATOR: Their mission was to replicate the radio transmissions of the units they were impersonating. GAWNE: It's an art of knowing just how many and what type of messages to send. And this is one of the things that the 23rd did, was it studied its own army's transmissions so they knew if they were simulating an infantry regiment moving across an area how many times a day would the regiments send messages to battalion, would battalion send messages to regiments. We painted a picture in the German intelligence as to what was going on. NARRATOR: These three distinct units-- the 603rd with its dummy tanks, the sonic company with its audio equipment, and the signal company with I radios-- became the deception core of the Ghost Army. In May 1944, they headed for Europe, filled with excitement and uncertainty. IRVING STEMPEL: You couldn't really believe that what we were going to do would be effective. How could we come along with rubber dummies and blow it up and make it look real? 
[00:17:17]


DOWD: None of us took it that seriously. We did what we were supposed to do. We didn't really believe the big picture. Until we got fired at and shot-- when reality struck. RADIO ANNOUNCER: Allied naval forces began landing Allied armies this morning on the northern coast of France. DOWD: A week after the invasion of D-Day, I was with this nice girl, and I remember thinking, "What in the hell am I doing in the British countryside "with a pretty girl when there are guys my age being shot at and killed in Normandy?" And I remember kissing her goodnight and riding my bike back to our tent. And there was a light on in our tent, and somebody said, "Who's there?" And I said, "Sgt. Dowd." And a voice said, "You'd better get in here." And I said, "Well, let me park my bike." And one of the wise guy members of the platoon said, "You're not going to need your bike anymore." The next day we were on Omaha Beach in Normandy. NARRATOR: Surprise orders had come down for a 15-man platoon to head to Normandy with dummy artillery ahead of the rest of the Ghost Army. The time had come to see whether they could really fool the Germans and survive. BERNIE MASON: Before we knew it, we were on this C-47. Landed on a metal mesh landing strip on Omaha Beach on the morning of June 14, which was eight days after D-Day. NARRATOR: The platoon was under the command of Lt. Bernie Mason. MASON: My assignment was to report to the commander of the 0th Artillery Battalion, and our objective was to set up dummy artillery emplacements about a mile ahead of his actual position to try to draw the enemy's fire into our position, and have his not touched. 
[00:19:30]


NARRATOR: Victor Dowd was a sergeant in Mason's platoon. DOWD: And I can remember the wild difference between last night, when I was in the lovely, quiet, serene countryside, and the grim reality of today, where I could still hear machine gun fire. So the fighting was within earshot, certainly, and there were dead German soldiers all over the ground. I did a sketch of a German helmet and a potato masher hand grenade. So this, to me, symbolized war. NARRATOR: Task Force Mason worked with the 980th artillery for 28 days. Their deception proved successful. They tricked the Germans into shelling their phony guns, but managed to avoid suffering any casualties. Two weeks after D-Day, the rest of the Ghost Army-- minus the sonic company, still training in England-- packed its gear and shipped out for France. SHILSTONE: We were anchored off of Normandy, and we were going to disembark. And we were loaded down with everything-- rifles, ammunition, helmets, and so forth. We were waiting for our names to be called so we would go over the side on the cargo nets into the landing boats onto the beach. And I looked out and I saw this incredible scene, something that I would... felt I would never, ever see again in my life. This was really history in the making. So I did this sketch, which is very rough, but it gives you an idea of what it looked like, with the barrage balloons and every imaginable kind of ship as far as you could see. 
[00:21:38]


NARRATOR: Once ashore in Normandy, the men set up their dummies to make sure everything was in working order. SHILSTONE: I was on guard duty, and two Frenchmen on bicycles got through the perimeter. And I halted them. And they weren't looking at me, they were looking at something over my shoulder. And what they thought they saw was four GIs picking up what was a 40-ton Sherman tank and turning it around. They looked at me, and then they looked at the situation. They were looking for answers. And I finally said, "The Americans are very strong." NARRATOR: In July and August, the Ghost Army conducted its first large-scale deceptions using visual and radio only. With each performance, they learned how to make themselves more convincing. CLARK: At every level, the art of war requires intelligent and creative thought. And probably no more so than in the practice of deception. Because there you have to see into the mind of your adversary. And you have to create for him a misleading picture of the operation to come. And you have to sell it to him with confidence. It's the highest kind of creativity in the art of war. NARRATOR: Deception demanded an artist's eye for detail. JARVIE: We could position certain things so that they would be hidden, but kind of hidden in plain sight. So if reconnaissance planes came over, maybe they would just see the corner of something sticking out. And they know if they can see one or two sticking out, there must be more that they can't. We wanted to create the natural debris that goes with faking something. 
[00:23:39]


NARRATOR: A company of Ghost Army combat engineers used bulldozers to create phony tank tracks. JARVIE: We did similar things with artillery-- lay phony artillery shells around and make it look as if they had been firing. NARRATOR: Moving through the French villages so recently occupied by the Germans, they saw an opportunity to improvise yet another way to sell their deceptions-- targeting enemy spies that might have stayed behind. They called it "Special Effects." Why don't we put a stencil of the name of the unit that we were simulating right on the trucks? And why don't we start a counterfeit shoulder patch factory where they would see we're the 75th Division, one of the divisions we did. NARRATOR: Sometimes they used actual patches from the unit they were impersonating. Other times, they had to hand- paint their own knockoffs. SYRACUSE: So we began to put on their patches and put their bumper markings on. And we physically assumed the role. Only for every hundred of them, there might be ten of us. JARVIE: Our job was to go in with our phony markings and phony stories that we were pretending to be officers and soldiers from another organization. And we were turned loose in town-- go to the pub, order some omelets, and talk loose. BERRY: A lot of the guys went to the bakery, got rolls and stuff, and said, "We've got to get an extra supply because we're moving out tonight"-- that kind of thing. It was almost kind of silly, really. But I think what really confirmed the fact that there was effectiveness was sitting in a caf?? and seeing a door open up gradually and somebody was taking pictures. We'd find out if, like, a division or a special unit had a particular song that they liked to sing. We'd get blitzed and then sing their song. 
[00:26:14]


NARRATOR: As the Ghost Army made its way through France, the artists in the 603rd broke out their sketchbooks. To be in the middle of this incredible adventure with the world at war in a foreign country, I just had to put it down. JARVIE: Any given opportunity, the guys would draw. Guys would draw with a fountain pen and spit. You make the drawing and then you wet it, and it makes nice halftones in there. NARRATOR: A few miles from the Ghost Army's first bivouac was the Normandy village of Tr??vi????res. The artists were drawn to a bombed-out church off the town square. These were some of the first sketches I did-- they were not too long after the invasion-- in the remains of this church. We might have had three or four guys in there sketching. We were sleeping in hedgerows and foxholes, but nothing kept us away from going someplace to do a watercolor. DOWD: I was not the only soldier with a sketchbook. I'd have sketched whether I was the only soldier or not, but to be quite honest with you, I think it helped keep me in balance. I think it kept my sanity. 
[00:28:31]


NARRATOR: In mid-August, Allied armies broke out of Normandy and raced across France. The Ghost Army was on the move as well. Their destination was the port city of Brest, under siege by the Allies but still tenaciously held by the Germans. JARVIE: Brest was a hard nut to crack. It was a seaport that the Germans wanted to defend, and we wanted it because we needed a port. NARRATOR: The sonic unit had just arrived in Europe, so Operation Brest became the Ghost Army's first chance to use all its means of deception at the same time. Their mission was to inflate the apparent size of the American forces attacking Brest by impersonating the Sixth Armored Division. They sought to draw German reserves to the flanks, clearing the way for an attack in the center. Sound trucks pulled to within a few hundred yards of German lines. WALKER: Crank the speakers up out of the back of a halftrack and play a program to the enemy all night of us bringing equipment into the scene. We could make them believe that we were coming in with an armored division. NARRATOR: They painted 6th Armored markings on their trucks and drove them back and forth through nearby towns. We did a lot of ride-through with two guys in the back of a truck to make it look like it was full. NARRATOR: Radio operators mimicked a tank battalion coming into the line. More than 50 dummy tanks were set up, along with dummy artillery. They were so close to the front that shells frequently screamed down around them. 
[00:30:33]


BOB THOMPKINS: We could see the church tower where they're observing us. And, of course, you had to tend these dummies all the time. During the night, the gun turrets would sag, and that's a bad visual effect the next morning if the Germans are looking down there and seeing sagging gun barrels. SHILSTONE: To see a gun like that would be quite a giveaway. We didn't have any guns that shot into the ground like that. NARRATOR: Captured German officers revealed to interrogators that they were convinced the 6th Armored was really there. But in the minds of many veterans, that success was overshadowed by the deadly consequences of an American attack mistakenly launched right where the Ghost Army was attracting German attention. We did a very successful sonic imitation of the assembling of tanks, and for some reason or other, the commanding officer of this tank battalion sends his tanks right down the ravine that we had played for dummies' sake. NARRATOR: German anti-tank weapons drawn by the deception opened fire on the American tanks. JARVIE: Those guys never reached the line of departure, which is the point that they want to start their attack from. They never even got that far; they got decimated. We had no way of knowing they were going to kick off an attack, and they had no way of knowing that we weren't going to help them. And it makes you feel lousy. 
[00:32:34]


("La Marseillaise" playing) NARRATOR: On August 25, 1944, the city of Paris was liberated from more than four years of German occupation. Parisians were still celebrating as the Ghost Army pulled into a nearby town to await their next operation. For one wonderful week, they would savor the pleasures of a Paris still giddy with euphoria. "Paris was put off limits and on limits so often," recalled one Ghost Army officer, "that everyone, in confusion, visited it whenever possible. "It was a great town. "The girls looked like delightful dolls, "especially when they whizzed past on bicycles "with billowing skirts. The Parisians were very happy to see us." SHILSTONE: We got in every night. And came back pretty drunk, and then started the next day and then the next night in Paris, and so forth. We went to a caf??, which was a brothel. And the ladies would come... be downstairs in their scanty costumes, and again it was a great opportunity for me to draw. I'm not Toulouse-Lautrec, but here were these women in their underwear. A woman named Doris sat on my table. She had a glass of wine in her hand and a cigarette in the other hand, high heels and practically no clothes on. And she was trying to entice me to go upstairs. And I wouldn't have had to pay anything if I gave her the drawing. But I wasn't particularly anxious to go upstairs with Doris, and I decided to keep the drawing. 
[00:34:44]


NARRATOR: All too soon, the pleasant interlude in Paris came to an abrupt halt. The Ghost Army was ordered to make a mad dash across France to lend a hand to General George Patton's Third Army. In Patton's haste to capture the fortress city of Metz, near the German border, a yawning gap had opened up to the north. GAWNE: If the Germans realized that there were effectively no troops in the 70-mile-wide stretch, they could have broken through easily. And if they could have gotten some of their mechanized units there, they could have surrounded Patton at Metz to the south. This was a very, very severe risk. In other words, there was nothing between the German army and Paris but a bunch of rubber tanks. NARRATOR: German troops we incredibly close, just across the Moselle River, making sonic deception particularly crucial. Sonic trucks operated for four straight nights. DOWD: Enormous sounds of tracks racing through the forest, sounded like a whole division was amassing. Sergeants' voices yelling, "Put out that goddamn cigarette now!" It was fakery, it was all a big act. NARRATOR: The Ghost Army held the position day after perilous day, aware that every passing hour increased the odds that the Germans might see through their deception. CONRAD: And there was nothing between us but our hopes and prayers that separated us from the Panzer division. NARRATOR: Even Patton himself was feeling the pressure. "There is one rather bad spot in my line," he wrote to his wife, "but I don't think the Huns know it. Holding it now by the grace of God and a lot of guts." After seven days of high-stakes play-acting, the U.S. 83rd Division arrived to fill the hole for real. Patton's line had held, and the Ghost Army faded away. In September, the Ghost Army relocated to Luxembourg City. For the next three months, it served as their base for deception missions up and down the front. 
[00:37:22]


HARRIS: So if we went out on missions, we came back to Luxembourg. And we were in an old seminary building, and we were living pretty good. And the town was not destroyed, and it even had art supplies stores. NARRATOR: Between missions, some of the artists in the unit sought to capture the beauty of Luxembourg's old city. NARRATOR: One artist constantly sketching was a 21-year-old from Indiana named Bill Blass. MASEY: Bill Blass. Great guy, wonderful. Knew what he wanted, read Voguein his foxhole. The rest of us are a bunch of slobs, but not Blass. He was always dressed to the nines. We all had the same uniforms, but leave it to Blass to have his pressed or something. NARRATOR: Blass filled his notebooks with ideas for women's clothing, even sketching a logo he wanted to use for his fashion designs after the war. Those of us from New York, you know, thought we were very sophisticated. But Bill, of course, came from Fort Wayne, Indiana, and was far more sophisticated than most of us. BILL SAYLES: He was charming and he was genuine and he was eager and he was attractive-- he was the whole thing, he was the package. NARRATOR: In December 1944, the Ghost Army headed out on what seemed like just another mission, their sixth since arriving in Luxembourg. Heavy fighting was taking place near the German city of Cologne. But further south, a 90-mile section of the front along the rugged Ardennes forest was thinly held by just four American divisions. 
[00:39:36]


BIOW: The Army in its wisdom decided they would send the wonderful 23rd Headquarters up there to create the illusion that there were more troops than there were. And we went in representing the 75th Infantry Division, which was still in England, as I recall. NARRATOR: But the sector wasn't nearly as quiet as it seemed, and the Ghost Army was about to get caught up in one of the biggest battles of the Second World War. JARVIE: The Germans were coming in, getting ready for the Bulge. They were putting all their heavy hitters in there, and we didn't know it. NARRATOR: In the early morning hours of December 16, Hitler's legions unleashed a massive surprise attack in a last-ditch attempt to win the war. Dazed American units along the front barely knew what hit them. CLARK: Suddenly, out of the snow and out of the darkness, a group of men in white uniforms are moving toward you, and you're thinking, "Well, what is that?" And they're 300 yards, they're 200 yards, and suddenly you realize that's the enemy. And it's almost too late. NARRATOR: The attack would become famous as the Battle of the Bulge. If you look at where the Germans attacked, they attacked smack into the 23rd Special Troops. The fortunate thing was that on the evening of December 15, came midnight, somebody in their wisdom decided to pull us out. So we left at midnight, December 16, and the Battle of the Bulge started about 4:00 a.m., December 16, just shortly after we left. And if we'd have been there, there'd be no 23rd. NARRATOR: Back in Luxembourg City, less than 20 miles from the attacking Germans, Ghost Army gunners manned rooftop machine guns and blazed away at attacking Luftwaffe planes. It was the only time during the war they actually had a chance to fire at the enemy. 
[00:41:45]


MASON: I was given the order to set charges on all our vehicles so that in case the enemy overran Luxembourg, we would destroy it. So that was kind of scary MASEY: Victory looks like it's in sight. The Allies are pushing like crazy. Then, whammo, out of nowhere, "Pack up, we're going, the Germans are coming." I said, "What do you mean, the Germans are coming? Isn't the war over?" "No. "We've got to go; we're leaving. "You have an hour to get all your stuff together. "We're getting out of here. "Trucks are waiting in front of this building. We're retreating." "Retreating? "We're supposed to have won this war, or on the verge of winning it." I mean, it was a very depressing moment. What's happened? Where did these Germans get this suddenly eleventh-hour energy from? NARRATOR: The Army didn't want to risk blowing the cover of the deceivers, so they were hustled to the rear. BIOW: Now it's Christmastime. What do you do next? Well, one of the guys went out and cut a Christmas tree and rigged it inside the pillbox. And then the question, how do you decorate it? Well, one way was to inflate condoms and hang them on there like balloons. And the other method was to take tin cans and cut stars out of the tin cans, which we hung on the trees, and that was our Christmas tree. DOWD: There were Polish refugees and other Middle European refugee children. And being American soldiers, we tried to enliven their lives by giving them presents and so forth. And I did indeed do a drawing of a little boy. I can remember it so vividly. He had this box, and it was open, but he was so forlorn looking, and nobody could get this little boy to smile. God knows what he'd been through. 
[00:43:50]


BIOW: And that was Christmas in 1944. NARRATOR: By January 1945, the German attack had been blunted and the Allies were back on the offensive. The Ghost Army was called on to conduct a series of deceptions to mask where each new blow would fall. Suddenly, they were busier than ever. They ranged across parts of Luxembourg, Belgium, France and Germany. ALBRECHT: Man, we used a lot of fuel. We traveled more across Europe than I'm sure any other Army unit. NARRATOR: For months, the men of the Ghost Army had led a charmed life, often drawing fire but taking virtually no casualties. On March 12, 1945, the odds finally caught up with them. They were impersonating the 80th Infantry Division, and sobering proof that their deception worked came in the form of deadly German artillery fire. (explosions) And there were people probably no more than 20, 30 feet away from me that lost limbs because of shrapnel just falling all over. DOWD: And I can remember sitting in the truck with my truck driver and a bunch of guys in the back of the truck, and a shell landed in front of us, and then a shell flew over our heads and hit the truck behind us. And I was thinking, "Do I tell them to get the hell out of here now?" And with that, the signal came and we moved. And it was just a case of luck. "Luck" is the paramount word. If you're in the wrong place, you can be dead. If you're in the right place, you can live to be as old as I am. 
[00:46:05]


NARRATOR: Two men were killed, 15 wounded, in the Ghost Army's deadliest day. Just two weeks later, the men of the Ghost Army set out on what was to be their last and most critical mission of the war. CLARK: The Rhine River is the western boundary of the most important industrial heartland of Germany. It's the most direct route to Berlin. So the heat was on. And the idea was how to get across the Rhine River. NARRATOR: The 21st Army Group under British General Bernard Law Montgomery was picked to make the major thrust across the Rhine. Two divisions of the American 9th Army, the 30th and the 79th, would lead one wing of the attack. The job of the Ghost Army was to fool the Germans into thinking that those two divisions were actually going to attack ten miles to the south. To pull it off, they would have to operate on a bigger scale than ever before, with thousands of lives at risk. Operation Viersen would require 1,100 men to convince the Germans that they were 30,000. We moved on up to this last grand deception. NARRATOR: Hundreds of decoys were set up around the towns of Anrath and Dulken. Real armored vehicles and infantry were used to enhance the illusion. Enclosed farmyards were turned into phony repair depots. A forest was converted into a decoy motor pool. BIOW: We even had dummy L-5s, small observation planes that were inflatable. We created an airstrip so from the air it would look like an active unit complete with its air observation components. 
[00:48:09]


NARRATOR: So convincing were the phony airfields that a real observation plane mistakenly landed at one and was promptly told to get lost. As the real divisions were moving in, their radio operators went off the air at a pre-assigned moment. Ghost Army radio operators began imitating them, creating the illusion that the troops were traveling to the fake point of the attack. German intelligence radio monitoring and traffic, which thought they could identify the signal of an individual telegrapher, missed it. These guys were that good. NARRATOR: At night, the sonic trucks played the sounds of soldiers assembling the pontoon bridges needed to span the Rhine. Created this effect of all this preparation for crossing the river at that point. NARRATOR: On the eve of the Rhine crossing, Allied Commander Dwight Eisenhower and British Prime Minister Winston Churchill joined General Montgomery to witness the momentous occasion. Tremendous efforts had gone into the deception, but no one knew whether they would really work. In the early morning hours of March 24, Navy landing craft began crossing the Rhine. Infantrymen on board steeled themselves for fierce fighting. What they found, however, was weak and disorganized resistance, as if the Germans were expecting the attack someplace else. EICHHORN: The 9th U.S. Army gets across with so few casualties, they would almost have that many casualties if they were running a big training exercise. NARRATOR: U.S. Army intelligence officers were convinced that the deception was a rousing success. Captured German maps showed the 79th Division right where the Ghost Army portrayed it. "There is no doubt," said one report, "that Operation Viersen materiallyssisted "in deceiving the enemy "with regard to the real dispositions and intentions of this Army." In some people's minds, it probably justifies the existence of the whole unit. And it's pretty impressive. 
[00:50:46]


NARRATOR: Once of those impressed was the Commander of the U.S. 9th Army, General William Simpson. He wrote a letter of commendation, calling the deception "an important part of the operation," adding that it reflected "great credit on this unit"-- a glowing review for the final performance of the Ghost Army. SHILSTONE: The day I got out of the Army I think was the happiest day of my life. It wasn't day I got married or when our son was born or anything else, but when I got out of the Army. NARRATOR: After the war, Arthur Shilstone became an illustrator, working for dozens of magazines. He was one of many Ghost Army artists who went on to successful art careers. Jack Masey was another. MASEY: I learned a lot, fooling people and deceiving people, and it stood me in very good stead for the rest of my life. NARRATOR: Masey designed exhibits for the U.S. government, including the 1959 Moscow Exhibition that that was the site of the famous kitchen debate between Khrushchev and Nixon. A surprising number of Ghost Army soldiers won fame as artists and designers. Bill Blass became a fashion superstar; Ellsworth Kelly, a celebrated minimalist painter. Arthur Singer's bird illustrations earned him world renown. Art Kane's photograph of 57 musicians on a stoop in Harlem remains a jazz icon. Many others made their mark as designers, illustrators, painters, sculptors, and architects. The official Army history of the unit and the details of its wartime operations were kept under wraps for more than 40 years. We were told we couldn't tell our wives or anybody about what we did. It was totally secret. Americans were pretty convinced the next war was going to be against the Russians. And so when you have operations that work well against the Germans, you don't want to tell the Russians what you did because then they'll be prepared for them and it will be useless against them. 
[00:53:18]


NARRATOR: The Ghost Army never launched an attack, never took a position. Their victories were of a different sort. EICHHORN: Did it absolutely baffle the Germans every time? Probably not. Did it cause the Germans to react in ways that we wanted them to react? Definitely. There are German records that show that some of the deceptions were taken hook, line and sinker. The 23rd did not win the war singlehandedly, but I think it would have cost a lot more American casualties had they not been there. JARVIE: You know you saved lives. You don't know how many you saved, but you know you saved them. They estimated that we saved between 15,000 and 30,000 lives with our maneuvers. But even if we only saved 15 or 30, it was worth it. One mother, or one new bride, was spared the agony of putting a gold star in their front window. That's what the 23rd Headquarters was all about. NARRATOR: The story of the Ghost Army is one of creativity flourishing under the most extreme circumstances. Their best art was not the paintings and drawings they left behind, but the ephemeral masterpieces they created on the battlefield. ALBRECHT: Can you picture the German commander, after he was preparing to dend himself and perhaps attack over in our direction, going over there and finding nothing but maybe a lot of tank tracks. Because we were gone. That's the Ghost Army. The Ghost Army is available on DVD. To order, visit shopPBS.org or call us at 1-800-play-PBS. For more on the Ghost Army, visit our website at pbs.org.

Point had been the most expensive tornado in american history. That was the first tornado, MOORE OKLAHOMA, MAY 3rd, 1999, To cause more than a billion dollars damage on the ground. That was eclipsed when joplin was hit a couple years ago. Before now, joplin actually was the reigning record holder for the most expensive tornado in history. Today there are sad new estimates that moore, oklahoma may once again end up being the record holder in that sad category. The fire chief says it is his goal to search everything three times before the window on finding more survivors closes. The mayor of oklahoma city told us live he doesn't expect to find any more victims alive in moore. The latest death toll by the medical examiner's office, at least 24 people were killed, 9 of them kids. 
>>> Lawrence o'donnell picks up live coverage. Thank you for being with us. 
>>> The sun has justet on the day after here in moore, oklahoma. Some people who survived yesterday's tornado have returned to this street where all of the homes have been destroyed and they've been looking for something, anything that they can pick out of the rubble that was once their homes. 
>> Thank you for joining us on this day two of the tragedy in moore, oklahoma, coming to a close. 
>> This is the cover of the OKLAHOMAN, WORSE THAN MAY 3rd. 
>> As a nation, our focus is on the rescue. 
>> We can confirm according to the medical examiner. 
>> The death toll has been corrected. 24 fatalities have been confirmed. 24, including 9 children. President obama declared the region a major disaster area. 
>> Fema administrator craig fugate. 
>> He is already in oklahoma. 
>> On his way to oklahoma as we speak. 
>> The devastation unlike anything people on the ground have ever seen. 
>> For 40 minutes, tore through block after block of homes and businesses. 
[00:02:00]



>> Damage measured in miles. 
>> Leveling everything in its path, including two schools and a hospital. 
>> We have a lot of tornadoes in oklahoma but we don't have tornadoes like this. 
>> Our prayers are with the people of oklahoma today and we will back up those prayers with deeds for as long as it takes. 
>> Tonight, rescue workers here in moore, oklahoma continue the work of searching for any signs of life from those who could still be trapped after yesterday's devastating tornado hit this community. We now know the tornado was an ef-5, the strongest type on the scale. Winds as high as 210 miles per hour. Officials have revised the number of fatal victims of the tornado down to 24 people, including a three month old baby and eight other children. 237 people are listed as injured. Here is a look at new video of the tornado just as the tornado was forming. The path of the storm now officially stands at 17 miles long. It was on the ground for 40 minutes with a base of 1.3 miles at its widest point. As many as 20,000 families could displaced. Just a few hours ago, oklahoma's governor mary fallin took an aerial tour of the entire path. 
>> We started, took an aerial tour where it started to where it ended, flew over schools, neighborhoods, businesses hit so hard. It is amazing that anyone could survive that type of force and devastation with the tornado. I've seen a lot of disasters in the state of oklahoma, I think this is one of the very worst we've seen in our state's history. 
[00:04:15]



>> We're also seeing new video like this one from facebook user jason ledger showing his neighborhood just before the tornado hit and again as he emerged from his storm shelter. 
>> The lord giveth and the lord taketh away. 
>> Joined now my msnbc's kris jansing who has been reporting from moore, oklahoma all day. Kris, you got here 24 hours ago. 
>> Yeah. 
>> Take us through the news of today, especially involving the change in the number of fatalities. It was a much higher number 24 hours ago. 
>> It was. Officials tried to correct it quickly. If you look behind you and see the devastation and multiply that by 17 miles, which is the length of this, as you said, a mile and a third long, you realize this looks like a war zone. It is actually being described as the fog of war, the chaos that often ensues after a disaster like this. There is so much effort put into finding people who may still be trapped, recovering those who may have died, that sometimes in that confusion, in the lists of people who are missing, things get misreported and that's what happened here. 
>> I saw that path from the air today, there's some stunning areas of precision where really a house that's just a few feet away is completely okay and then the house here is totally devastated and the house on the other side is completely okay, it is remarkable in some areas how narrow the path became. 
[00:06:19]



>> Just at the end of the block there's a medical center completely gone. You also see right next door to it where children were playing at the time, there was a daycare center, all of that has been ravaged, has to come down. Across the street there's a movie theater, people got messages on the phone, saying bad weather coming, all went out into the hallway. 
>> They were in the theater. 
>> In the theater watching movies. Everybody's phone started going off at the same time. Then they came and evacuated them into the hallway. They heard it, it sounded terrible. But then it passed and they thought maybe it wasn't so bad and walked out and everything around them was gone, including some bowling lanes right across a parking lot. 
>> Right across that parking lot from the movie theater is this hospital center which has been completely devastated. It is just across the street from where we're standing now. That's the kind of weird precision we're talking about. Hospital totally wiped out, movie theater okay. Just a parking lot separating them. 
>> On the roof, there were aerial shots showed a car on top looks to me to be a five to six story medical center. Talking to meteorologists, you talk 200, 210 miles per hour winds, those are winds can move a car the length of a football field. There were people not just coming to these houses today, people that parked at the medical center that worked there who were visiting patients there who came to see what happened to their cars, and they weren't there. They're somewhere but they couldn't find them. 
>> We will be joined by debbie gidry, one of the homeowners in the area. Debbie, where was your house? 
>> My house is right there. 
>> Right there. That was your house. 
>> It sure was. 
>> Did you lose cars also? 
>> They're still in the garage, next door to each other. 
>> Red one? 
>> Red one and silver. 
>> Looks like they might pull out of there. 
>> May be all right. A motorcycle is on top. 
>> Two houses down, saw a teenager who refused to give up on his car that looked almost crushed. After an hour, he backed it out with no windshield. 
[00:08:24]



>> Good for him. 
>> Drove it away. 
>> You're smiling about this. Is it that you feel that it call could have been worse? You're happy to be here? 
>> Absolutely. You know, I mentioned to one of my former neighbors that came to look at the street, see what was, I said you know, it is not the things that are in that structure that make the home, it is the people that are in it, and we all survived. We had a storm shelter, we were in the storm shelter as the tornado came through. 
>> And did you feel confident in the storm shelter the whole time? 
>> Absolutely. 
>> It was that solid down there. 
>> Yes, yes. 
>> And do you have friends who live around here who have been through this kind of thing before? 
>> Yes. We actually lived in our home 31 years. 
>> And has it been untouched by tornadoes in 31 years? 
>> All around us, this is the first time we took the hit. Several of us moved in when we were young, we were growing old together, you know. It is our turn I guess. 
>> And because you have friends who have gone through it before in previous tornadoes losing their homes, have you been talking it through with them, have they told you here is the way it works, here is what happens next, here is what fema does, all of that stuff? 
>> I have gotten a lot of advice, texts. MAY 3rd, '99, MY PARENTS' HOME Was involved, we have reference from that year, but lots of help. Everybody has been real informative. It is just kind of now they call you and tell you what the next step is. 
>> Where are you staying? 
>> My parents live in moore, we're with them. They don't have water or electricity, so we're camping out. 
>> I can't get over your good 
-- have you been through grieving hours? 
>> There have been a couple times I looked at it, felt a total loss. Most important thing, my husband walked out and I walked out behind him. That's most important. 
[00:10:28]



>> How are you feeling about the task ahead? Do you think you'll rebuild on this spot? 
>> We think we may. This is home. 
>> Have you been able to talk to neighbors? 
>> We did. One neighbor, two neighbors were in the storm shelter with us. It is kind of an exciting story. We were in with the door locked and secured and we heard noise. It has a steel plate on the top of it. So even the smallest piece of hail sounds like it is a huge boulder. We thought we were hearing hail, it was the neighbor pulling on the door, trying to get in. So we unlatched the door, let him in. It wasn't probably two minutes until we heard the noise. 
>> Kris jansing, you have been on the street all day, is this the spirit you have been encountering? 
>> It is remarkable. We just saw a family almost all belongings left were in three wagons, and a little harley with a three-year-old on it, they found the three-year-old's dog. They were so elated by that, they said look, this is everything that matters to us. Our family. And it is a little stunning to see. You dodge a bullet, but if you don't, seems like the community comes together. I have seen it a dozen times today, lawrence. It is amazing. 
>> Debbie, why aren't there more storm shelters here? 
>> Well, you mean as far as individuals having them? 
>> For homes and for the community? 
>> I think because it happens quite often you can get lulled into a false sense of security. 
>> The last one you survived. 
>> Yeah, it was fine. It was over there, you know, it will be fine. Actually the storm shelter we have was within the house when we bought it, part of the home when we bought it. But several people on this street have one. But there's a sense of it is not going to happen to me, or I get enough forewarning, I'm going to outrun it, I'll go someplace else. 
>> I have seen a bunch of them today, they're not cheap. 
[00:12:30]



>> No. 
>> That steel door you were talking about is very serious structure that you have to put in there. There could be a cost factor for people. 
>> There was in 1999 an incentive program they helped people that wanted to put in storm shelters, the mayor said earlier today when I talked to him, he thinks that saved a lot of lives. Some people took advantage of that. He would like to see that happen again, this time give people an opportunity to defray some of the costs. 
>> Debbie, what do you need now. What's the first thing you would like to have? 
>> I would like to have a shower. 
>> Okay. After that, just talking to, you know, my insurance folks and finding out what their direction is and the next step. We'll go from there. 
>> Debbie, I am so glad that you're out here and smiling about this. 
>> Thank you. 
>> And I think we all share your sense of priorities. Getting out alive was what mattered. 
>> Absolutely.

This gives a glimpse inside the national weather service forecast center which isn't far from here in norman, oklahoma at the university of oklahoma. According to "time" the warning that the center issued 16 minutes before the twister hit included the rarely used term "tornado emergency." That designation was created DURING THE DEVASTATING MAY 3rd, 1999 storms that touched down in chickasha, the point of the phrasing was to con vain this was something different from what anyone in the area was likely to have experienced before.

>>> As a nation, our full focus now is on the urgent work of rescue and the hard work of recovery and rebuilding that lies ahead. 
>> Today, the moore, oklahoma fire chief provided this update on the search and rescue effort. 
>> We will be through every damaged piece of property in this city at least three times before we're done, and we hope to be done by dark tonight. No survivor has found recently in the past few hours. 
>> Any found today? 
>> No, sir. 
>> Joined by paramedic crew chief shawn lauderdale who aided the rescue effort. Shawn, where were you when the tornado hit? 
>> I was actually in norman. I was in my office earlier in the day and saw the storm coming, went to my house to evacuate with my wife and child. 
[00:18:52]



>> Where is your house from your office? 
>> I'm located about six blocks south of the briarwood elementary school. So it is about ten miles from my office. So I drove home, packed up my wife, my child, my pets, drove back to norman to clear the path of the storm. 
>> So then what did you do after that? 
>> After I was quite certain that the tordo had crossed i-35, I returned to my house, put on my uniform, couldn't get anywhere 
-- 
>> was your house okay? 
>> Had damage, minor damage, mostly roof, but put on my uniform, then I walked the six blocks to the school. 
>> Then what was the scene at the school? 
>> It was pretty chaotic, a lot of parents, lot of responders, trying to figure out where i could fit in to help. 
>> How did you help? 
>> Just helping coordinate getting people out of the school and then at some point caught a ride with another agency ambulance up to the warren theater to meet up with the crew. 
>> The scene at the school, you have parents who are arriving, were they allowed into the school? Was there any restrictions on that? 
>> They weren't up in the rubble but were all around it obviously concerned, looking for their children. 
>> Did you know some of the parents and families? 
>> I do. My children attended briarwood. 
>> Were they saying hey, sean, asking you about names, is my kid in there? 
>> Wasn't necessarily that specific, but a lot of people looking, asking if I knew where so and so was. 
>> And when you got there, you had no idea what the situation might be, how bad it might be in there. How long did it take you to establish what the damage was and how many kids were going to be injured in that? 
>> Well, just right away I heard radio reports on the way there and just right away from seeing the devastation, I knew potential for a lot of injured people. 
>> And knowing that it is children that you're going into, is there a different mindset going into a scene where you're going to try to rescue children? 
[00:21:00]



>> It is not really a different mindset, just a job to be done. There's more emotional involvement because I have kids myself, just focusing on getting the job done. 
>> What are you telling your own kids tonight about their own safety? 
>> That, you know, I mean, as parents, we work hard to keep them safe and just that they're fortunate. They're not, you know, a lot of other people out there not as fortunate tonight. 
>> When I see some of the kids that were in some of the worst situations talking about what they went through, I'm left wondering how kids here are going to feel safe going forward. What can you say to them? This is such a random kind of event. You never know where it is going to hit. Hard to prepare for. 
>> I agree. I think it is going to be individual for each child in how they're going to be able to cope.

>>> We are back live in moore, oklahoma. I am joined by nick and shannon. They were both on duty at the hospital here in moore and had to help move patients to safety as the tornado approached. Shannon, I imagine it was a lot of feelings of helplessness when a tornado is approaching. Who could feel more helpless than patients in hospital beds that can't do anything for themselves. What did you have to do? 
>> You know, that was our job that day was to make sure the patients felt safe and the staff felt safe, so we were confident in what we were doing. We knew we needed to take care of them to protect them and ourselves, and we just did what we needed to do. 
>> Nick, did the patients know how serious the threat was as it was approaching? 
>> I have a feeling most patients knew it was serious. We try to be careful, not scare anybody, let them know it is a serious situation, need to get everybody safe. You know, everybody was calm, patients, community members showed up to seek shelter were calm, we were able to move everybody quickly and efficiently. 
>> So the hospital was shelter for people in the area that decided that would be the place they wanted to be? 
>> Yes. We had a lot of community members show up at the hospital seeking shelter minutes before the tornado hit and we had folks posted in different positions by entrances, kind of funneling them forward to safe areas of the hospital. 
>> What are the safe areas. Where did you move the patients to? 
>> My patients were initially on second floor, and what we normally do in that situation is move them to the hallway and close the windows and doors away from windows and doors. We knew that we were probably going to get hit. We made the decision to move them downstairs into an interior part of the building in the emergency department where nick's patients were. 
>> What about patients that need the most treatment, patients who are in intensive care. What do you do with them? 
[00:27:49]



>> What we basically do, try to do, make sure we knew which were the most serious, kept track of patients in the hospital at the time, then when it is time to evacuate, arrange in an order to be transported out first. Within getting patients out of the building, across to the warren theater, and making sure everybody was safe, I believe the first patient left probably within three to four minutes, us getting out of the building to the warren theater. 
>> How many patients did you have to evacuate? 
>> There were 30 patients in the building at the time, 9 were shannon's patients. Had four more ob patients, labor and delivery, and also had four patients, outpatients getting lab tests and other things. 
>> Patients and personnel, were they all out by the time the tornado hit? 
>> We did a really great job of identifying a quick exit. We had enough personnel to help move patients out. We had some obstacles getting out of the building, but we were able to make it out and across the street, and we got everybody out safely. 
>> They would not have survived if you hadn't gotten them out of there, looks like a total disaster area. 
>> Yeah, we moved everybody that was in the building was in the center most part of the building. We saw surprisingly few injuries. Knicks, bruises, scrapes, a few cuts here and there. Everybody inside that building, we were thinking there were 250 to 300 in the building at the time, and everybody was safe, as safe as they could possibly be. 
>> Nick, shannon, thank you for joining me. Thank you for the work yesterday saving lives. Really appreciate it. 
>> Thank you. 
>> Joining me by phone, the mayor of moore, glenn lewis. Mr. Mayor, thank you very much for joining us again tonight. 
>> Thank you, appreciate you guys getting our story out. 
>> And mr. Mayor, what does moore need most now? 
>> Right now we actually need people to get out of the way. We've got so many people coming from out of town to look at it that they're hampering our recovery efforts at this point. 
[00:30:00]



>> And in terms of help from the state or federal assistance, are you getting everything you need? 
>> Absolutely. I got a call from president obama, he's offered all the resources that we can use, anything we need basically is what he told us. The fema director himself came into the city this morning, bright and early. They have over 200 boots on the ground now. The governor has been here the whole time, she just went home. She was here last night. I mean, she has been phenomenal to work with. Everyone tried to help their best. Appreciate all of the help. 
>> Governor, I had a conference with the governor here in this location before the show, i asked her when she thought she might get to sleep. She seems to have no idea. Mr. Mayor, I am wondering about the opportunity comfortable the community 
-- for the community when they feel not safe in their homes. Has moore as a community figured plans for that before situations like this? 
>> Well actually most of the people have safe rooms. A lot of the older areas do not have safe rooms. All the new houses, they basically, every one of them has a new safe room in it, so it is just the older part of town, a lot of which was hit. Most people either have a safe room or storm shelter. We were very fortunate. We had 12 minutes of warning on this. A lot of people 
-- our city about 50,000 population. We had unfortunately 19 deaths, oklahoma city area had five. We are doing as good as we can right now. 
>> Mayor lewis, can you take us through what happened today on what turned out to be the very good news that there were many fewer lives lost in this tornado than we thought 24 hours ago. How did that news unfold for you? 
[00:32:15]



>> I was actually walking through the neighborhood over there I believe with the governor when the news first came to us from the medical examiner's office from the state. It was quite surprising because we had been told all the time it was 51. And we're not sure where that number came from. The official report was 19, 24 total, but we were fortunate. Still at the same time that's lot of people that were killed in this tornado. 
>> It really is a horrible loss. Mayor glenn lewis, thank you very much for joining us tonight. 
>> Thank you, sir, appreciate it. Bye-bye. 
>>> Coming up, one estimate says as many as 20,000 families may be displaced by yesterday's tornado. How this community is dealing with that part of the tragedy next.Air, I'm breathing better.

>> That was former oklahoma governor frank keating, talking to msnbc's andrea mitchell, talking about the humanitarian crisis this deadly tornado has left in its wake, up to 20,000 families with nowhere to live. The red cross has opened four different shelters in the area, and university of oklahoma has opened up student housing in norman for those who have been displaced. Churches are also running their own emergency shelters, more than 170 members of the oklahoma national guard are here tonight helping police, fire cruise and rescue workers with the massive recovery effort. I am joined now by msnbc's thomas roberts who has been on the ground here in moore all day. Thomas, the red cross effort here has really geared up quickly. 
>> It really has geared up quickly. As you brought out top of the show how people turned out today, trying to pick through their homes, to find anything they could take away for so many that lost so much, american red cross has been here, they set up quickly as you pointed out, four different shelters. I spoke to somebody before coming on that said they don't have exact figures of how many people they've seen come to their doors, but they're not hurting for those that are displaced and already served thousands of meals and have dozens more convoys on the way to the area. It has been interesting, though, to see the resiliency of the community. Great guests tonight living on this street. 
>> Amazing. 
>> We bumped into toby keith, hometown boy, hometown hero, sister lives around the corner, talked about why the community is important to him and also about the resiliency we have seen here. 
>> You've got to be in utter shock to see your hometown look like this. 
>> Well, sad, happens here quite a bit. Every four, five years you get to see something like this. This was on the ground a long time like the one in '99. In between there, same places '99, got hit two, three more times, smaller version. They're resilient, bounce back. Neighborhoods help neighborhoods, they come together. It is amazing. Part of the reason I live here. I love the spirit of this place. 
[00:38:39]



>> Thomas, the smiles that you get here and the good cheer, i wonder at a certain level how much is shock. There's something about these people know that this is possible here and in psychological terms they seem to be ready for it. 
>> As we've seen in the context of looking back at the storm of 1999 and knowing the damage that storm created for this area then, here we are fast forward to today, almost identical storms, almost identical storm paths, the amount of damage we see today is pretty much the same as they lived through before. This community will come back. Tomorrow as we were watching today, this is kind of a soaking in process of the devastation. Tomorrow is going to be definitely more about the rebuild but also about the mourning because we have the 24 confirmed deaths, nine of which were children, so the community is still going to be in mourning moving forward. We at the other location had a family living there, they said they want to rebuild, want to come back. Homeowners there for 12 years, love their street, love this neighborhood. You know what, I bet they'll be back. 
>> The story they told about saving their children in that bathtub was amazing, where they put the sofa cushions on top of their kids in the bathtub, mother and father then put their weight holding down the cushions. After the tornado was over, they just stood up and discovered there was no house around . 
>> It is absolutely amazing. They have three little girls, a six-year-old and two four-year-old twins. Amber and nathan are their names. They said the twins saved their blankets, but wanted to come back to find something for their six-year-old. The six-year-old goes to plaza towers elementary but was out because she attends early morning kindergarten. 
>> I was helping their mom search the rubble. I found two very beat up digital cameras. I was able to get them open and the discs were still in there, pull out both discs and give them to her. See what pictures she gets. 
[00:40:52]



>> That's fantastic. People are looking for things, trying to find what we could possibly find. She seemed a little 
-- she was very alert, present, but also a little dazed, looking at this, thinking where do I even turn. 
>> Well, the house to her, she explained, this was the living room, this was the kitchen. You look at it, it is a slab. Hard to make anything out except for the bathtub, and that saved their lives.

>>> Seven children were killed inside plaza towers elementary school here. Nbc news kate snow has more on what happened inside that school as the tornado hit. 
>> Reporter: Inside the walls of the plaza towers elementary school, 500 students were counting down the days in the final week of class. In a matter of minutes, the campus went from looking like this to this. Classrooms completely obliterated, an auditorium caved in. Parents of other students tell nbc news children were in the auditorium. 
>> Seen it from the air. This is it behind me, as I step out of the way, let joe zoom in. This is the front of plaza towers elementary school. This school is basically gone. 
>> Reporter: In the hours after the tornado, dramatic images, young children were rescued, and with darkness, the search for survivors continued. Some children had escaped harm, their paren picked them up before the school went on lockdown monday. The majority stayed inside as they practiced in drills many times. Math teacher rhonda crossway was helping sixth graders with an end of school game when the principal came over the loudspeaker, told them to go to the hallway. Damien klein is a fourth grader. 
>> She told us all to get a math book or your bag. I already had my bag. Then we went in the hall.

>> Why did she tell you to get a math book or bag. 
>> We could put it over our head. 
>> Reporter: A fifth grade teacher saw the funnel cloud approaching, yelled for everyone to leave and get into bathrooms or closets. 
>> You have to get them in there. He was like you're getting in there, too. She was in a bathroom crouched over four children and did what teachers do. 
>> I remember a little boy saying I love you, don't let me die. I said we're not dying today. Did I the teacher thing we're probably not supposed to do, i prayed and prayed tloud.

>> And here is more video of briarwood elementary school just moments after the tornado hit. 
>> She's out? 
>> Joining me now, the man that recorded that video and took many of the defining photographs from the past 24 hours, a photographer for the oklahoman. Paul, when did you first head to the school? About 30 minutes before I sat down listening to weather reports on the radio. 
>> Were you anticipating catching it hit and you wanted to catch it with cameras? 
>> I was hoping so. What I tried to do is get south of the line from what they were talking that it might pass to get a better shot at it looking north. 
>> Take us into the emotion of that parking lot. I've never seen anything like what you just showed us on your corded video. There's a kind of hysteria there, people are tense about what they might or might not find there. 
[00:55:30]



>> Right. The situation, there's something happening every direction. As a photographer, don't know which direction you can point the camera. All of the children crying, teachers doing their best to calm them down. But they have been through the most horrendous event of their life obviously. Most of them missing their parents, wanting to know that everything is okay and just takes a long time to get them calmed down after what they have been through. 
>> This was the school where everything was okay. You watched parents arrive there in a panic and at some point find that child that they were looking for and you saw those hugs. 
>> Yeah, I sure did, s, quite a number of different cases saw where the parents ran up to the children and made that reunion. Saw one woman almost 20 minutes frantically looking for her child, at the end she had her little girl with her, so everything worked out well. 
>> Were there any moments there where it felt like this was going to end very badly for some of the people? Did you have that feeling in your gut? 
>> I really did, once they started 
-- I thought they had all the children out, then saw they opened up another area of the school, started pulling more out. And a few minutes later, rescue workers arrived, started digging through a wall and ceiling. Hoping there weren't children underneath there. Fortunately, there weren't. 
>> Thank you for sharing your work with us and thanks for being with us tonight. 
>> Thank you. I appreciate it. 
>> I am joined for final thoughts with kris jansing, thomas roberts. Kris, you have seen more of this than I certainly have, you have been in many of these disaster areas. How does this experience compare to other things you witnessed? 
[00:57:37]



>> I was thinking looking at the amazing video of the hugs and reunions and some of the iconic still pictures that something that binds tragedies together is distillation of what's important. There's a perspective, even in tragedy, in death, the meaning of life, how important, how we value it, what our family means to us, what our friends mean to us, how much stuff doesn't mean when you know that there are little children who are crushed under the weight of their school. So I think resiliency is a word you used a lot in this hour, and we see that part of the american spirit and that coming together of communities is what gives us hope, keeps us moving forward, makes what might be an unbearable tragedy somehow able to be born. 
>> How are your thoughts on the second day of what's happened? 
>> You talked to paul to close out the show. We began with paul's images this morning. This was the cover of the oklahoman. It is small. SAYS WORSE THAN MAY 3rd. Shows that image of the woman carrying a little girl, man carrying the other student out with bloodied faces and it is amazing to think they lived through that. Again, this is briarwood, where the national weather service went to evaluate the damage so they can now categorize it as an ef-5. It is full circle on what it means, I will be interested to see the images for tomorrow's paper. 
>> Kris jansing, where does the community go from here? 
>> There was a memorial service tonight, certainly others. They will be moving forward. There will be small children that will be buried, including that baby you mentioned at the beginning. There will be a rebuilding and commitment to the community. As we have seen so many times before, there will be a sense of a new start for people that want to stay here and remain neighbors. There's always that push and pull when we come to scenes like this about how horrible it is what happened, but the possibilities of what lie ahead. Sounds like a hallmark card in some cases, but I have found over the years it is true.

=======================================================

Te time. Jake tapper starts right now. 
>> I'm jake tapper and this is "the lead" coming to you live from moore oklahoma where there is the lead, the race to find survivors. Search and rescue crews are going through the debris, these homes on the southwest sixth street here in moore. You can see the rescue effort going on over my left shoulder. The rescue crews said they would be back in this neighborhood for a second and third time to make sure there was nobody needing rescue and recovery. The mission is daunting. Rubble along the 17 mile long path carved by one beast of a tornado. It is at least two miles wide at points. We know that 24 people died when it touched down 24 hours ago. At least nine of them were children. The death toll is lower than first indicated but could be very much in flux as rescuers scour for heart beats. More than 100 people have been rescued so far. Direct hits tragically at two elementary schools. The stories from there are heroing. Lahoma governor put the damage into perspective earlier today. 
>> Homes were absolutely destroyed, taken away. There is just sticks and bricks basically. It's hard to tell if there i structure there or not. You get into some of the major neighborhoods you can't tell where the streets were. 
>> The national weather service says survey crews found at least one area of ef-5 damage. That's a category of tornado, the worst. That means winds of 200 miles per hour or higher. 40,000 people remain without power here in the state of oklahoma. For blocks and blocks here there are now no homes to send power to. The city of moore, where I am standing saw the worst of it. The skies have not yet cleared. More rain pounded the area today. It felt almost like hail at times. This is one of the times when words really fail to capture the scope of the damage as survivors look upon the twisted metal and the snapped wood and smashed brick that used to be their homes and their businesses, their schools and their play grounds. They know theork here is really just beginning. 
[00:02:34]



>> We have lost everything. We don't have anything left. 
>> It's just devastating. I don't have any words. 
>> The day after, an urgent frantic search for survivors. Entire neighborhoods blown apart, homes blasted to nothing but boards and splinters. Trees uprooted like weeds. Rubble towering over survivors' heads. Debris turning up at least 100 miles away, all of it from this. 
>> Oh, my god! 
>> Probably hope to never see anything like this again. 
>> All over moore, oklahoma are scenes like this with individuals trying to tow the debris away and isolate it, put up a fence and try to get back to normal. This was a truck. Today condolences for the tornado victims rolled in from all across the world. The president vowed to give all the help needed in the face of udder dev administration. 
>> There will be enormous grief that will have to be absorbed. Your country will travel the path with fuelled by our faith in the all mighty and faith in one another. 
>> If you are in this area you need to take cover now. 
>> Tornado hit just about 24 hours ago all of it playing out live in real time on our air. 
>> A tornado just touched down in new castle, oklahoma. 
>> This type of tornado will just level towns. Honestly this is getting very scary. 
>> The nation watched helplessly on television as people in the region rushed to get out of harm's way. We have seen footage of tornadoes before but only took a balance to know this one was different. 
[00:04:35]



>> This is not good. Dear god, please keep these people safe. 
>> At least two miles wide by the time it tore through the town of moore. The gigantic tornado raked across the suburbs of oklahoma city, 17 miles in the span of 40 minutes. Two elementary schools stood directly in its path. 
>> There is another school that is trashed. 
>> The tornado hit just as the school day was ending, children scrambling for safety, teachers attempting to shield them. 
>> We had to pull a car out of the front hallway off a teacher. I don't know what that ladies name is but she had three kids underneath her. Good job, teach. 
>> His teacher saved his life. I have no doubt god and the teacher 
-- 
>> parents suffered unbearable moments of uncertainty. They sent their little ones to school never imagining it would be the last time they see them. For the lucky ultimate relief and hugs they never wanted to end. 
>> We are going to hear more about the heroic teachers. I want to speak to moore city manager. Thanks for joining us. Quick question. First of all, we are told that the death toll right now is 24. Do we think that that is going to stay at that. 
>> That is what my understanding is now that it is that numbe for some time. We feel confident it will remain at that number. 
>> There was confusion because they were double counting? 
>> I'm not exactly sure. I don't know what the confusion was but there was some. From our perspective the number was never over about 19 or 20. 
>> We think of the 24, nine of them are children. 
>> Seven is what I heard. 
[00:06:36]



>> The big question everybody wants to know is of those who are missing, numbers given yesterday of hundreds missing, have most of them been located or found one way or another? 
>> As I understand it, again, we had the press conference earlier over at city hall. The sources then, fire chiefs, oklahoma city chiefs have indicated that everyone has been found. 
>> Of course, this is a horrific storm and we are more focused on the loss of life and those who have been hurt this is going to take a huge financial toll on the city. Is moore going to be able to recover from this. 
>> Absolutely we will. Certainly we will have to have the help of our friends in the federal government with fema so with that coming and we are confident that will come, we will be fine. We have been through this before. We had a major storm in '99 about thi level. May 3 of '99. Another one in 2003. Similar tracks. And we have come back stronger than before every time. 
>> Is there anything that could have been done differently? 
>> It came up very quickly. It really wrapped up very quickly. So if it hadn't have been for that in terms of maybe a little longer warning perhaps but there was a good 15 or 20 minutes warning before it hit our city limits so I don't think there is anything more that could have been done with this type of storm as big as it was. 
>> So little warning. Thank you so much. God bless and good luck to your city. 
>> It was the end of the school day and the kids at plaza towers elementary school were closing their books, stuffing their backpacks and getting ready to head home. That is when the tornado warnings changed everything. I spoke with fifth grader about what it was like when the tornado hit. 
>> The roof caved in on all of us while we were in the school. 
[00:08:36]



>> Reporter: Where were you? 
>> The fifth and sixth graders were huddles in the bathrooms. All we heard was a lot of rumbling and then stuff falling on our heads. 
>> Did something fall on your head? 
>> Yeah. I know the vent fell on my best friend. 
>> Is she okay? 
>> Yeah. 
>> What grade are you in? 
>> I'm in fifth grade. 
>> How did the fifth graders do? 
>> A lot of them were scared crazy. Some were bleeding worse than evers, yeah. 
>> Did everybody make it? 
>> Most of us did. 
>> What was it like when you found her? 
>> We were searching for her and then they brought her. One of the moms had her and brought her out to me. She was covered in dirt. 
>> Had you run to the scol? 
>> I had run to her friends house. That was the back side of it. I was going to the house which was gone and looking for her. 
>> Tell me about the moment when you saw her. 
>> Itas very emotional. Kind of in shock and seeing her all wet and dirty. 
>> She kept it together. 
>> What was it like to see your mommy? 
>> I started crying and I hugged her. I was like I love you mom. 
>> It must have been a pretty good hug. 
>> Yes. 
>> The 17 mile long twister stayed on the ground for 40 minutes when it was finally gone so was the school. Seven children were killed. Oklahoma needs our help. You can donate online at redcross.Org or text red cross to 90999 to give $10 to the relief effort. You can call 1-800 redcross to donate by phone. 
>>> Coming up anguished parents rush to their children's schools moments after the tornado hit. Now we are learning just how terrifying it was for those kids. We will talk to one teacher who shielded her students from the storm. Plus another teacher had more than students to save. Her own son was also in that room with her. Their story next as our special coverage of the oklahoma tornadoes continues. end but a friend under water is something completely differe. I met a turtle friend today so, you don't get that very often. It seemed like it was more than happy to have us in his home. So beautiful.

>>> You're looking at live pictures of the scene here on southwest sixth street in moore, oklahoma. Welcome back to "the lead." I am live here on the street where homes and businesses were literally shredded by yesterday's powerful tornado. Teachers thrust into the role of life saving heroes rushing kids to safety, comforting them and shielding them with their own bodies until they were reunited with their parents, saving dozens of lives that are just getting started. We saw it at sandy hook elementary and now at two schools flattened here in oklahoma. Spoke to some of the brave educators. Teachers around here, tornadoes are not new. They are trained to deal with this type of natural disaster. 
>> They go through the training. They know it well. They have come to expect it here in oklahoma especially here in the town of moore. We went a few miles from where we are standing here. We met tammy at brierwood elementary and talked about what it was like. Her classroom was on the back edge of the school and was hit as the tornado barrelled through the city here of moore. She talked about how she brought the students into a couple of bathrooms. She had about 20 students in all. We met with her a little while ago and talked about what that experience and what the ordeal was like for her. When you look at what is left it is simply staggering to comprehend that everyone walked out of here alive. Students and teachers and administrators. You look at the trucks and cars that were blown on top of the building and landing on the very areas and spaces where these kids were seeking shelter it makes it more incredible to believe that they all walked out of here alive. When you put the kids in the room and you told them that you loved them, do you think that they grasped what was about to happen? 
[00:16:22]



>> I'm not really sure. I mean, still at the moment they were saying this isn't a drill. It's not a drill, sweetheart. Put the book over your head and pray. 
>> This is what you saw just 
-- 
>> right before we went in. You could feel the suction and my ears were popping. That's when I looked up and i could see just like chocolate brown milk. It looked like chocolate milk color. My ears started popping. 
>> Powerful story. Thank you so much. Now joining me on the phone is chad lowe. His wife, cindy, is a first grade teacher. And she risked her life and limb to shield the kids in her class including their own 6-year-old son. Chad, thanks so much. God bless you and your family. How are your wife and little boy doing today? 
>> My little boy is fine. He's got no more bumps and bruises than he does any other day. My wife has a concussion. Obviously she is trying to just remain calm and try to stay in secluded places. She has a bad sprain on her ankle and lots of cuts and bruises buthe is going to be okay. 
>> Thank god. They routinely practice tornado drills at the school, of course, because the area does have a lot of tornadoes. The moment by moment details of when the tornado hit are chilling. Tell us about what your wife did to protect these children including your own son as the school literally crumbled around them. 
>> Well, you know, they have procedures as was mentioned and the procedures state to go to the inner part of the room. In this case they had a built in book shelf there. All of the kids are instructed to get into the fetal position and grab some books and use those to shield their heads. My wife got some desks and pushed those up sort of giving them a shield from the rear. And just got ready. She heard a knock at the door. It was a couple of parents. And one of them is a teacher's assistant at that school. She let them into the room. So they all sort of huddled down. That's when she sort of got over my son and the other children and just sort of was trying to shield anyone she could. 
[00:19:06]



>> Your son's in kindergarten. Did you know that she was with your wife when the tornado hit? 
>> I had a pretty good idea. Phone reception was difficult because the signals were strained. She did text me that s had requested for him to be brought to her room and have a teacher's aid or someone bring him there. So I got that text message. I felt pretty certain. Typically the schools are made of cinder blocks and have steel. I thought the school will be fine. Obviously you can see what happened. 
>> We are so glad that your wife and your son are all right. Thank you for sharing your incredible story with us today, chad. 
>> Thank you. 
>> Plaza towers elementary school also took a direct hit, the school where seven children drowned while taking shelter in a basement. We have more on the recovery effort there. 
>> I can't get up very close to the school because there is such an intense effort going on right there. There is a lot of law enforcement in the neighborhood. They are evacuating that area because there are a lot of gas leaks and they don't think it is safe for people to be walking around. There are rescue teams around the school. There is a big crane overhead and industrial lights shining in so they can do more of the recovery action. They are very serious that people cannot get that close while they continue to search and go through all of this debris. The neighborhoods around of course are destroyed. I did talk to a couple of teenager whose had family in a house close to the school. They say their grandmother was able to stay safe hiding in a bathroom which was the only room in the house still standing. 
[00:21:07]



>> Thank you so much. 
>>> Coming up on "the lead" it's the question so many people in oklahoma are asking, why were some homes flattened while others are spared as if nothing happened. We will look at how fast the winds were going in the path of the massive storm. 
>> Wounded people walking around the streets. They were walking wounded. They were bloody. People had stuff sticking out of them from things flying around in the air. 
>> Just what kinds of injuries are doctors dealing with here. Our own dr. Sanjay gupta is at moore medical center with an update on the wounded. Stay with us. American story. I'm a teacher. I'm a firefighter. I'm a carpenter. I'm an accountant. A mechanical engineer. And I shop at Walmart. Truth is, over sixty percent of America shops at Walmart every month. I find what I need, at a great price. And the money I save goes to important things. Braces for my daughter. A little something for my son's college fund. When people look at me, I hope they see someone building a better life. VO: Living better: That's the real walmart. me diabetes, I remember thinking there's a lot I have to do... check my blood sugar, eat better. Start insulin. Today I learned there's something I don't have to do anymore. My doctor said with Levemir?? FlexPen??... I don't have to use a syringe and a vial. Levemir?? FlexPen?? comes prefilled with long-acting insulin taken once daily for type 2 diabetes to help control high blood sugar. Dial the exact dose. Inject by pushing a button. No drawing from a vial. No refrigeration for up to 42 days. Levemir?? (insulin detemir [rDNA origin] injection) is not recommended to treat diabetic ketoacidosis. Do not use Levemir?? if you are allergic to any of its ingredients. The most common side effect is low blood sugar, which may cause symptoms such as sweating, shakiness, confusion, and headache. Severe low blood sugar can be serious and life threatening. Ask your health care provider about alcohol use, operating machinery, or driving. Other possible side effects include injection site reactions. Tell your health care provider about all medicines you take and all of your medical conditions. Get medical help right away if you experience serious allergic reactions such as body rash, trouble with breathing, fast heartbeat, or sweating. FlexPen?? is insulin delivery my way. Covered by most insurance plans, including Medicare. Ask your health care provider about Levemir?? FlexPen?? today. ] days... When he said "everyone gets health insurance"?

>>> Welcome back to "the lead." I'm jake tapper live in moore, oklahoma. You are looking at shots from southwest sixth street here in moore. More than 100 people have been pulled from the wreckage here after yesterday's monster tornado. One that left one hospital destroyed with hundreds in need of care. Dr. Sanjay gupta joins us outside of what once was moore medical center. Sot that hospital was right in the path of the storm. Looking at the building right now you would think it would be hard to survive. But they did. How? 
>> Reporter: It's pretty remarkable. You remember, jake, we saw something similar in joplin, as well, where a hospital becomes something in the path of the storm. Some of it is just fast thinking. Some of it is preparation by people in order to try to make sureients and staff are safe moving, for example, as you have heard to the center of the building if you can to an area away from windows. It was fast thinking I think and a lot of prep work. Nobody in my understanding is talking to doctors, no one was injured inside the hospital. You look at that. The top floor is just gone. It is a 45 bed hospital. Many patients were evacuated after that. The situation at that time. There were still storms and concerns about tornadoes at that time. So in addition to trying to get these people to safety they, themselves are putting themselves at risk. It was a pretty dramatic unfolding situation. 
>> Dozens of survivors have been hospitalized and more than 200 others have been treated. What types of injuries are we talking about? 
>> Reporter: When you think about this and we have talked about it in the context of other natural disasters. The primary injury from the force of the tornado itself. Shrapnel is going through the air. I'll show you just around me here probably around you as well there is debris everywhere. This is something that came off of probably a house. Something like these. These all become potential sources of injury, impalements, broken bones. At least two significant spinal cord injuries. Bowling ball for example. We find bowling balls, again, thrown around. All of this part of the second wave of injuries and the third wave when bodies themselves, people actually going, being thrown against other objects. Those are the types of injuries. What is interesting, and we'll find out why this happened. There weren't as many brain or head injuries as you would normally expect. That they even saw back here in '99 with a string of tornadoes. Not sure why that is but a little good news for you perhaps.

>> Thank you so much. 
>>> Coming up next we'll talk about the 1999 tornado. One family's home was obliterated 14 years ago. This time they were not taking any chances. They survived hunkered down in the basement. But, sadly, their neighbor did not make it. That story is coming up next. Plus, why do so many massive tornadoes hit this one area of oklahoma? It's not a coincidence. We'll explain. Bill. Hey!

>>> welcome back to the lead. I'm live in moore, oklahoma amid the tornado destruction here. There are so many amazing stories of survival. I want to bring in chief national correspondent john king. You met some folks in the plaza towers neighborhood not far from one of the schools that was hit. What did they have to tell you?- 
>> Just a remarkable story. It looks like this. There are hundreds of them. Home site after home site and they are devastated. Paul and rita phillips were in their home yesterday and lost everything in 199. THEY CALL THAT MAY 3rd. Already folks are calling this MAY 20th. They lost everything. One big difference. When they rebuilt this time they put in a little storm basement below the house. When they heard the storm coming they got down there, eight of them, rita the grandmother, 2-year-old grandchild. They talked about how loud it was in there and they talked about just how remarkable. Listen to their story about being in there and waiting. We've seen the first responders coming through. Imagine waiting just after it hit. 
>> Where were you when it happened? 
>> I was in the celler with my daughter, my daughter-in-law who is pregnant. 
>> The cellar full of water now. That's what they came out of. The fire department had to dig them out. The four grand kids, pregnant daughter-in-law. 
>> They dug you out? 
>> Yeah. 
>> What time was that? 
>> I don't know. What time was it? As soon as the storm was over and we just opened up the cellar door. Got out of the hole about this big where they could get some signals from the phone and called the emergency line then turned around and we started screaming and they said they had to get people because they couldn't get us out. Then they pulled the debris up. 
>> How many of you were down there? 
>> Eight. 
>> Eight of you? Everyone is okay? 
>> Yes. 
>> Everyone is okay. One of our neighbors was killed. They found her. You know, but over all I think so far that's the only fatality we've had in our neighborhood. 
[00:34:06]



>> That we know of. 
>> That's just after daybreak. We got there, went into the neighborhood. They tried to go back last night and couldn't. You saw the photo. He showed me on the phone and then texted me. He said the house collapsed on top of their basement. This little tiny hole and they were screaming and the first responders came and took them out. Eight of them, pregnant daughter, 2-year-old grandchild. When they went back this morning they went back to find memorabilia but they had two dogs. Titan was alive, shaking, trembling, clearly dehydrated and shaken up but they got one of their dogs and were searching the neighborhood hoping to find the other. We met many people who came back not to try to find just some piece of memorabilia but a pet. 
>> One thing people don't realize necessarily is it is very expensive in oklahoma to build a cellar because the dirt is so moist it is very tough to do so. That is why more people don't have them. Nothing short of a miracle that people caught in the middle of this 17-mile-long monster that tore through moore lived to tell us about their experience. As we mentioned, the national weather service says it found ef-5 damage in at least one area. That's the enhanced fujita scale which measures tornadoes based on their intensity and the amount of damage they leave behind. It does not get more powerful than an ef-5. Those are twisters that cause widespread devastation. Powerful enough to flatten homes and buildings. They havestimated wind gusts of more than 200 miles an hour. There's a reason why oklahoma has seen so many of these powerful tornadoes over the years. It sits in the heart of what's called tornado alley. It's an area that spans from texas up through the nation's mid section. What makes this area so vulnerable is that moist air from the gulf of mexico gets caught between the air from the desert and cold dry air from the colorado rockies, a recipe for instability and intense thunderstorms. While it may seem like tornadoes are more frequent now than aew decades ago the reality is people are much more observant when it comes to tornadoes spotting than they used to be. I want to bring in now allison, katy baur a spokeswoman for the red cross. Allison, first let's talk about the scope of the damage. We know that 24 people have been confirmed dead. More than 200 injured. How is the red cross dealing with this tragedy? What is the red cross doing for the survivors? 
[00:36:37]



>> Well, right n what we're doing is assessing the immediate needs of the people which is food, clothing, and shelter. When we can provide that first, and foremost, that is the way to go. Those are the needs they have right this very moment. Then after we assess the damage we can see what other things they need and bring those things in. 
>> How are you providing shelter? Are there cots set up in gyms? Are there vouchers for hotels and motels? 
>> We have various shelters set up. One in moore right now. We have three others that are set up outside of the area as well. And we have cots and food and blankets and mental health support. Things that you may need when you go to a shelter to be able to process some of this stuff when evacuated from your home. 
>> What can people do watching right now to help? They can text obviously. Tell us how to do that. What else can they do? 
>> You can text to give. Text red cross to 90999. 
>> That gives $10 to the red cross. 
>> A $10 donation. And you know what? Giving a donation is really a great thing to do right now. It prepares the red cross to respond immediately to disasters like this. We don't know when this is going to happen. But if we're prepared we can respond to things like this quickly. 
>> All right. Thank you so much. Really appreciate the work that you do. 
>> Thank you. 
>> Coming up on "the lead" the severe weather threat is not over. With tornadoes not out of the question in many areas we'll go to the cnn weather center for the latest forecast.

>>> welcome back to "the lead." I'm jake tapper in moore, oklahoma. You're looking at live pictures of the stars and stripes hanging from a home that has been destroyed. On the other side of that home, the owner spray painted, we survived 5-20-2013. The sun is starting to come out here in moore, oklahoma, as they're digging through the rubble trying to piece their lives back together. But survivor justin stefan whom I met earlier today just about a house or two over says that all that matters is that his family is okay. His home is destroyed. But his wife and three children are all right. I caught up with him as he was trying to salvage what he could from what was left of his home after the tornado. Where was your family when this happened? 
>> I was at work. My wife and two younger kids were here. 
>> They were here. 
>> Well, not when the storm hit but they were at home when the sirens went off. They went across the street. They have a cellar in their back yard. 
>> To a neighbor's. 
>> Yes. Right across the street. 
>> And everyone survived in everyone was okay? 
>> My daughter was at plaza towers, my oldest, but she just got a little cut on her leg that needed a few stitches. Other than that she did fine. 
>> It's messed up to say that but you are considerably blessed considering the horror that's happened here. 
>> Very much. 
>> Where are you going? 
>> Well, I don't think I can get the car out but I'm just trying to save pictures and like the little thomas for my son. Little things that mean the most to my family. 
>> Where are you going to stay? 
>> I have family that live in moore, in norman and up in ed mutua edmund so probably rotating back and forth between them. What do you do? How do you pick up and start again? 
>> I just 
-- I really don't know. I just know my family is safe so that's the only thing that really matters to me. 
[00:43:57]



>> That's right. God bless you, sir. Good luck to you. I'm so glad your family is okay. 
>> Thank you very much. I appreciate it. Amazing thing about justin stefan. As we were standing there he offered me and my producer water. He wanted to know if there was anything we needed. There wasn' anything we needed and our thanks to him and we're glad he and his family are okay. There is science behind the tornado with the size and power of the one that hit this town but there rarely seems to be any logic to it. So many structures blown away. Others battered but still standing. I want to bring in tom foreman. Can you tell us understand how this monster moved across the region? 
>> Jake, really this is one of the great mysteries of tornadoes. When you look at this kind of extraordinary damage you wonder why does one place last and another does not? After all, when the storm came cutting through here it was an equal opportunity destroying going all the way through the neighborhood cutting a wide swath and hitting many, many different buildings. So why did some stand and others not? A bit of it is chance. It may be that the gust is over 200 miles an hour in one place and 50 feet away. It may only be 150 miles an hour. If your house gets hit by the stronger one it makes a difference. There is also real physics at work here and the physics of construction. The national oceanic and atmospheric administration has looked at the way wind hits a building like this, the way in a storm like this it hits one side pushing and creates a vacuum on the other side which pulls away. That creates low pressure making the pressure in the house want to burst out and the whole time as wind rushes up over it, it grabs the eaves and tries to open it like a can opener. They have come up with this standard of what happens to most homes in that case and this is what it is. Basically, up to about 97 miles an hour, most homes can keep their roof on. Once the roof is torn away at about 132 miles an hour you start seeing walls failing and at 200 miles an hour the home is completely wiped out. Many places where there is no home at all because at some moment in that storm it crested 200 miles an hour in that particular spot and that is what took the homeut even though it might not have done it to a house only 50, 60 feet away because the wind may not have been quite that strong there. What about something like the school? This is a very different type of structure as you can see. It is flat and broad and the standards are different here. In this case, the winds will take the roof at about 101 miles an hour so only slightly more than the house. The walls will go about 139 miles per hour. Overall, the whole building can be taken about 176 miles an hour. That has to do with the structure. Think about this. This is broad. All of the rooms in a school by and large are bigger than the rooms in your home so if the roof and the walls start failing, there's less to support it than you would have in your home with smaller rooms and so it goes away. And finally, let's look at one last class here. Things like the hospital down here. We've all looked at this hospital today. It's huge, standing right in the storm's path. It gets hit like a giant sail. You might think this would be the first to collapse but the construction in a building like this is much more robust than you might think. Look at the standards here. Basically this roof is going to stay on up to about 114 miles an hour. The walls can stay in place up to 148 miles an hour. Even if the roof and walls start failing here you're probably just talking about the upper layers of it here and maybe the top floor but not all of them. All of that concrete and steel really does make a genuine difference so the whole building will hold up on average to about 210 miles an hour. I want to make one last point, jake, about the notion of averages. We are talking about averages here. There are maximums that have also been calculated by noaa and they're worth noticing. An average house out there can stand a maximum wind of about 220 and might still be standing. You might still have a chance. The average elementary school out there considerably lower. Remember what we said about all the big buildings. Then a hospital, big building like that, pushing 270 miles an hour before you're almost certain that it will come down. So, jake, there is an element of chance that everyone out there is painfully aware of but there is also pure physics to explain why some places stood and others fell.

>>> Welcome back to "the lead." I'm jake tapper. We're on southwest 6th street and moore. You're looking at our friend justin stefan whose home was destroyed. He came back to get items with friends and family with a remarkable attitude. He, his wife, and three children are all okay. Now they're surveying the damage, recovering more items. He told us his offer to give us water still stands. An increble guy, justin stefan. The people here in oklahoma are helping each other out, chipping in, bonding together. It's remarkable to watch. Many in the path of the tornado must have felt like they were reliving a nightmare because it not only took a nearly identical path as another monster twister but it left a similar amount of devastation in its wake. These are images of widespread devastation in the aftermath of a ruthless force of nature. Not from monday's tornado in moore, oklahoma but from a twister that slammed the exact same area. 14 YEARS AGO ON MAY 3rd, 1999. For nearly an hour and a half the 1999 tornado pummeled a 38-mile path that included the areas of new castle and moore. In a cruel twist of fate, the paths of both storms were nearly identical. At times, even overlapping. What you're looking at right now in moore, oklahoma is what you could have seen if you had been there in 1999. 
[00:53:44]



>> The 1999 tornado rated an ef-5 the maximum on the scale the fastest wind speed ever recorded on earth. And though yesterday's storm was given a preliminary rating of ef-4 it was no less horrific for a community that thought it had already seen the worst of what mother nature has to offer. 
>> Just hard to believe that something like this could happen again to moore, itself. 
>> Equally devastating. I think the fact that what we see so far today is going to be very similar if not exceed what we saw in 1999. 
>> Heather moore survived both the 1999 and monday's storms and last it night called in to pierce morgan. 
>> It was very, very similar. Cars were turned over. Some houses were knocked down, some all gone. 
>> Perhaps lessons learned from the 1999 storm saved lives when monday's tornado tore through town. The people of this community will no doubt show the same resolve and resilience to rebuild. Just as they did nearly 15 years ago. Insurance claims for the most recent tornado will likely top more than a billion dollars according to an official with the oklahoma insurance commission. That cost would be higher than the 1999 tornado. Coming up on "the lead" what was it like to live through this devastating tornado?

21st, 2013. I'm shepard smith live in moore, oklahoma. Oklahoma strong. O'reilly is up right now. 
>> Bill: The o'reilly factor is on. Tonight: 
>> How did this happen? 
>> Mr. Chairman, I can't say that I know that answer. 
>> Once again they don't know. The former chief of the irs says he has no idea why conservatives were targeted. This on the heels of the attorney general saying he has no idea why the justice department is snooping around reporters. 
>> I don't know what happened there about interaction between the a.P. And the justice department. I was recused from the case. 
>> And president obama saying he has no idea how benghazi got so screwed up. 
>> We were not clear who exactly had carried it out and how it occurred and what the motivations were. 
>> Bill: Tonight charles kraur and I will analyze the see no evil strategies. 
>> We had to pull a car out of the front hallway off a teacher and she 
-- I don't know what that lady's name is but she had three little kids underneath her good job teach. 
>> Bill: Lead story is oklahoma where the suffering is immense. We will take you there life and tell you some dramatic stories. 
>> 
>> everything is gone but the important things are alive. 
>> Bill: Caution, you are about to enter the no spin zone. The factor begins right now 
>> hi, I'm bill o'reilly, thanks for watching us tonight. Busy live program for you. In a few moments we have analyst from charles krauthammer about the continuing irs fiasco and that's what it is. The feds snooping around fox news correspondent james rosen. But first the lead story tonight, the killer tornado in oklahoma. Right now the death toll stands at 24. Hundreds injured after a fierce twister hit oklahoma yesterday. At least nine children have died seven of them trapped in an elementary school. Reports say they droed in the basement. Tornado hit moore, oklahoma, a community of more than 50,000, about 10 miles south of oklahoma city. This is the fourth time in 15 years that moore has been battered by a tornado. And it was just two years ago almost to the day that a brutal tornado destroyed joplin, missouri, 158 died in that storm. Now, reports say yesterday's tornado hit with more power than the atom bombs that were dropped on japan. 
[00:02:32]



>> We're watching this tornado. It is still on the ground it's a huge cyclone. 
>> You have to be underground or get away from the storm. It's a freight train and it's coming through moore right now. 
>> You guys need to get on the ground now. 
>> This is horrible! , It's horrible! Oh my god. 
>> This is not good. Please, dear god. Please keep these people safe. 
>> This is amazing, amazing tornado. This is just a deadly situation really. Damage in the billions. Human suffering impossible to calculate. 
>> There were people crawling out from everywhere and anywhere. Basically just a war zone. 
>> Now everything is just gone. These are my friends' houses. Really sad and scary and take so long to rebuild. 
>> When I got home i realized that there is nothing left of my house. 
>> I came out and I saw the cars and I saw the houses and I just started crying so hard. A light went down andit me in the head and all the other girls were screaming and they were crying. 
>> Some of our dearest friends' children we thought were in the school trapped. 
>> So scary. And a lot of my friends were still there when i left. 
>> Oh my god, I was praying to god so many times and I 
-- honestly I'm like I'm not going to see tomorrow. I was just like I don't want to die today. 
>> And joining us now from moore, oklahoma, fox news correspondent john roberts. John, have you been covering the story all day. What has made the deepest impression on you? 
>> Bill, I think it was what you just heard right there. And it was the deaths of those nine children. Seven of them at an elementary school that is just a few blocks over from where I am standing, the plaza towers elementary school. You know, any loss of life, in a tragedy like this is heart-breaking. But when it is children, and when those children are in school, it's particularly heart breaking. You send your child off to school in the morning and i talked with governor fallon about this just a few minutes ago. You send your child off to school in the morning, you think that it's going to be a safe place. And then by the afternoon, by 3:00 in the afternoon, that safe place that you thought you were sending your child to is suddenly rent asunder like pancake and seven children have died. Just to add a little bit to the reporting. Governor fallon and I were speaking about this idea of whether or not children drowned in the basement. She said that there were some initial reports that there was a basement at that school but she said that upon further examination there wasn't a basement. So the idea of children drowning on the ground floor is something that we're looking into. It doesn't quite make sense on the surface, bill. Maybe that they just suffered blunt force trauma when the walls came down. And here is a particularly gut wrenching aspect to the whole thing. That the children were sent to the cafeteria according to the associated press tornado warnings were first put'. Then when the sirens hit school officials said get out of the cafeteria. Go into the hallways to take shelter. Children were told to hug the wls and that's when those walls came tumbling down. 
[00:05:47]



>> Bill: You know what's interesting. 
>> Heart breaking to think what happened. 
>> Bill: As the story unfolds, as we mentioned, this is the fourth time that moore, the town of moore has been hit since 1999 with a fierce tornado. I wonder if the public school and private school officials have a plan when the tornado rolls through? Now, you say the school didn't have a basement. And then the kids were left relegated to go to the hallway, which isn't much protection from atom bomb type storm. I'm wondering whether 
-- you know, in this area and other areas in the midwest that are prone to getting tornadoes they are going to have to, you know, either big basements or things like that. That's a line of reporting that we'll do. Now, as far as you are concerned. Go ahead, john. 
>> 
>> I was going to say and i should point out, bill, that the newer schools that were built here in moore, oklahoma city, norman oklahoma, they all have safe rooms or they have stabbed alone tornado shelters. But briar wood a little bit further north of here and plaza towers were old schools. They were built in the 1960s. They were cinder block and bring and then they had the flat roofs with metal trusses. It wasn't required back then for them to have a safe room or tornado shelter. The only thing there to protect the kids were those cinder block walls and you put that much force on them they collapse like a house of cards. 
>> When you talk to the people live in moore because of all the tornado activity and the devastation now, are they giving up on their town? I mean, are they thinking about moving away? 
>> Not at all. I this I we came across one person who said they are done with oklahoma. It's too difficult living in tornado alley. All the other people that i talked to throughout the course of the day whose houses were blown away. They only survived because they were in their own tornado shelter whether it be in the backyard or one woman I met shannon wilson she 11 months ago spent the money to have a tornado shelter built in the floor of her garage, said it was the best money that she ever spent. 
[00:07:49]



>> Bill: Sure. 
>> She is going to rebuild her house and use that tornado shelter as the centerpiece for the house. >>l: WE APPRECIATE IT Very much. Have more on the tornado coverage with a woman who actually saved one of the kids in the elementary school that john was talking about. That will be a bit later on. Next on the run down it took just hours before the global warming people ran out screaming about the tornado. We have a report on that. Charles krauthammer and i will analyze the growing irs scandal. Now, one of the big shots there expected to take the fifth. Those reports after these messages.! end but a friend under water is something completely different. I met a turtle friend today so, you don't get that very often. It seemed like it was more than happy to have us in his home. So beautiful. AVO: More travel. More options. More personal.

>> When cyclones tear up oklahoma and hurricanes alabama and wildfires scorch texas, you come to us, the rest of the country for billions of dollars to recover. 
[00:12:02]



>> And the damage that your polluters and deniers are doing doesn't just hit oklahoma and alabama and texas. It hits rhode island with floods and storms. 
>> Bill: Joining us now from harrisburg, pennsylvania to comment weather guy joe bastardi who is not a believer in the global warming theory. A storm like this does raise questions about what's going on in the atmosphere, does it not? 
>> Well, there have been major tornadoes before, as a smask, the charts of the major tornadoes show they have been decreasing over the years. They reached their peak in THE 50S, SIX AND 70s. If you remember during the 70s WE WERE IN A GLOBAL Cooling scare. I'm not here to demean anybody. I will debunk them with facts though. This is not the first time we have heard this situation comments made, it's almost like ambulance chasing after these devastating events that cause misery to people. And then trying to tie an agenda into it. About years ago I came on your show, bill, and told you we were going into a time of climatic hardship because of the shift in the cycle in the pacific to cooler while the atlantic was still warm. This happened in the 1950s. It's why the 19 autos were so volatile with the tremendous tornado activity. The heat and drought in the center of the country and, of course, the hurricane activity up the eastern seaboard were white house seems to be ignorant of his own state of rhode island was hit four times in the 1950s, 8 hurricanes 19534 to 1960, just what do you think is going to happen if the same pattern shows up again? You are seeing the same things happen in alaska than did in the earl little 1950s and core reand a europe. You have a very similar pattern. And it produces, you know, the united states is only one.5% of the globe. So, produces this type of weather. The problem too is we have some more people living in the southern united states than we did in the 1950s. I went to oklahoma city. 
[00:14:05]



>> This storm that we are looking at right now, that's one of the most powerful tornadoes ever to hit the u.S.A., Right? 
>> Yeah. It is. There is no question. But, the 19125 tri-state tornado had a path of 180 miles from missouri into indiana, it was two miles wide. When you go back and look at the history and the death of the tornado death, which have been decrease, a large part to noaa and storm chasers seeing all these things before that happened you didn't have that before going on before. You understand people are living in harm's way. In 1962, oklahoma city moore was south of oklahoma city like it is now. But it's a much smaller town then. People living in harm's way and this goes through all the east coast. 
>> This is all throughout the midwest. The only solution there it isn't a solution because nature is nature. Whether there is global warming or isn't. You are going to have bad storms and that's that. You have got to build those shelters if you are in the middle of the country. You have got to have those underground escape facilities, correct? 
>> There is no question about that or the other option is that in a high risk day, like yesterday, you treat he it like a snow day. You do in the east where kids aren't all bunched in one center. 
>> Bill: They knew that this was a volatile environment now. So you say that everybody should have just said stay home, it's too unsettled here? 
>> No. What I'm saying is maybe that's a solution but, look, there is a price you pay for every step you take. 
>> Bill: And everywhere you live. 
>> Bury yourself in a corner? You live on long island, you know darn well what happened in the 1930s and 40s. 
>> I know what happened six months ago. We got whacked by sandy. You are right, you are right. But sum it up, joe because I have got to go. You believe this is just nature and this is just the natural order of things, correct? 
>> It is right out of the 19 autos. The pacific is cooling. The atlantic is still warm. Look to the 1950s and you will find a similar weather pattern. Yes, sir.

>> Bill: All the controversies in washington. According to a allergy an in the "new york times." Obama told confidants he would like to going bull worth. A complete phony. Toward the end of the film the senator has an epif fannie and decides to tell the truth. 
>> We can't get health insurance. Fire insurance. Life insurance, why haven't you come out why haven't you come out 
-- 
>> well, you haven't really contributed any money to my campaign, have you? [Boos] 
>> you got any idea how many these insurance companies come up with? They pretty much depend on me to get a bill like that and bottle it up in my committee during an election and then that way we can kill it when you are not looking. 
>> Bill: Now, as an american citizen, want president obama to go bullworth. To actually tell us what he thinks. Especially about the controversies in benghazi with the irs, and the justice department snooping around reporters. But so far the president is doing a great imitation of the late actor john banner. 
>> I see nothing. I was not here. I did 
-- get up this morning. I see nothing. 
>> Bill: Here is how bad the lack of information really is when chris wallace asked where the president was the night ambassador stevens was killed in benghazi, he didn't get very far. 
>> Do you not know whether he was in 
-- 
>> 
-- I don't remember what room the president was in on that night. That's a largely irrelevant fact. 
>> Bill: No, it's not. Americans want to know where the commander and chief was while his ambassador and three other americans were being killed. That is a valid question. Today, former irs chief doug shulman testified before the senate but predictably he doesn't know anything about targeting conservatives. 
[00:21:47]



>> How did this happen? 
>> Mr. Chairman, I can't say 
-- I can't say that i know that answer. I have now had the benefit of reading the report. And that's, you know, the full accounting of facts that I have at this point and so I 
-- I don't think can I answer that question. 
>> I don't know. Nobody, nobody can answer any questions. Do you sense a pattern here? If you are a fair minded person, the obama administration is becoming a frustrating experience, is it not just tell us what happened, mr. President. Stop dancing around. We don't need a replay of watergate. 
>> This is not watergate but there are some people in the administration who have acted as if they want to be nixonian. And that's a very big problem. 
>> Bill: Yes, it's big problem. Mr. President let's go bulworth tell us the truth. That's the memo. Now interesting information on the irs story. As you know president obama said he learned about the scandal on may 10th. White house council kathryn ruemmler apparently knew about it on april 24th and so did white house chief of staff dennis mcdonough. Treasury secretary jack lew knew about the irs investigation on march 15th. But, again, mr. Obama knew nothing until may 10th. Joining us now from washington, fox news political analyst charles krauthammer. And you say? 
>> Well, the president say everybody has to tell the truth. I was on this show last week thursday, the day the president answered questions from the press while standing next to the prime minister of turkey. There was a question asked by the bloomberg reporter. Did anybody at the white house know about the irs activities? And do you remember my saying on the show that time with you, that obama gave a very lawyerly and peculiar answer. He did not answer about the white house staff. He said I didn't know about the ig report until i learned about it in the press the question was not about him. The question was about the white house staff. And he deliberately dodged that answer. Now we know that when he was asked that question last thursday, he knew at the time that his staff did know about it, the press story from jay carney was only the white house counsel knew about is it but it turns out as you showed the staff chief of staff knew they were discussing how to let the story out. All this activity is going on. The president knows that they knew but he doesn't answer the question. That wasn't a lie. But that was a deliberate suppression of the truth. 
[00:24:43]



>> Evasion. 
>> And this from a man who somehow leaks to to the times the idea that he is now only interested in everybody on his staff coming out and saying what they know. Why didn't he say what he knew when that question was asked of him last thursday. 
>> Bill: They are not interestedn telling anybody anything. We know the answer to that now tomorrow lois lerner, the head of irs exempter organizations division is going to testify and apparently she is going to take the fifth amendment in front of the house oversight committee. This is huge. Now we're into creettle. Criminality. She didn't commit any crime she is going to take the fifth amendment anyway. This is building isn't it. 
>> When anybody takes the fifth in front of congress we impute 
-- it's not unreasonable that there is a lot they have got to hide and they are very worried. Yes, in acourt of law the jury is not supposed to impute that, but this isn't a court of law. 
>> Bill: No, this is the media and I'm wondering why this person is taking the fifth amendment. 
>> We are citizens making reasonable inferences that there is very nasty stuff here. And the reason there is more oxygen here is because the head of that committee, the one that held the hearings today that you showed in the clip, is a democrat. This is max baucus, the democratic chair of the senate finance committee. The senate controlled by democrats who said this story is very, very unusual and this there is a lot he said yesterday when he submitted 41 questions to the irs. Including did you have any communications about this with treasury or with the white house? 
>> Bill: Right. 
>> He said my gut tells me there is a lot here. Can you no longer have the white house pretending as itoes with benghazi that this is a partisan witch-hunt. This is democratic. 
[00:26:45]



>> Bill: This is getting huge. 
>> Bill: I'm going to give charles 45 more seconds because I want you to weigh in on james rosen. Rosen investigating a story about north korea retaliating to u.N. Sanctions by testing missiles. All right? That's what he was doing. Justice department wants to find out whose rosen's source is for this information. Goes in and looks at james' personal email account for about, almost a month. What do you say about that? 
>> This is a brazen assault on the first amendment. Freedom of the press. We traditionally will go after the emails of a person who is under criminal suspicion for leaking it. But we do not go after the journalists who merely are soliciting information. We have never had a successful prosecution of a journalist. 
>> Bill: Do you see an anti-fox play here? 
>> Look, I don't know whether in this particular case it was anti-fox. But it surely was an assault on the press. And we also know that from the beginning of this administration the white house starting with the president has tried to delegitimize fox and pretend somehow it's outside the sphere of journalistic integrity and protection so the fish 
-- 
>> Bill: This is all under the attorney general, all right, and he can't recuse himself from this so let's hear what you have to say, mr. Attorney general. 
>> To quote a democrat. The fish rots from the head. 
>> Bill: We have more on the controversy surrounding fox news and james rosen with our is it legal team in just a few moments. But directly ahead. Bernie goldberg on how cnn is covering the controversies in washington. Bernie is next. Sixty-two horsepower, a fully independent multi-link suspension and a top speed of 53 miles per hour.

Many choose us because we have the largest 4GLTE network. Others, because of our reputation for reliability. Or maybe it's because we've received JD Power and Associates' customer service award 4X in a row. In the end, there are countless reasons. But one choi. Weekdays with bernie segment tonight. We believe the benghazi, the irs, and the a.P. Snooping around has been fair. If you disagree, please let me know by email. Over at cnn, they have not covered those stories all that much. And there is a slightly sceptic call tone. 
[00:32:16]



>> Can you see in your mind's eye a way that this might not have been political, that this was a misguided stupid way to sort but that they didn't intend it to be some kind of political attempt to harass the tea party? 
>> I would think that if there was any chance that this was a mistake the investigator general wouldn't be coming out and saying otherwise. And the irs themselves wouldn't be admitting. 
>> They say it's a mistake the question is whether it's political. 
>> Bill: Yesterday I talked with bernie goldberg about the cnn situation. 
>> Anything wrong with ms. Crowley's posture? 
>> You know what? I'm not going to lose much sleep over her asking was it a mistake instead of being political. She gave him a chance tone a it does fall into the broad category of a reporter asking a scientist is it possible that the earth is flat because the chances of the earth being flat are exactly the same as the irs thing being simply a mistake. But, bill, there is something much bigger going on here, it's how the mainstream media, so-called mainstream media covers scan tells in general. Finance a prib republican scandal it's always covered as a scandal. If it's a democratic scandal it's covered as how are these cynical republicans are going to take advantage of this for politicall points? A classic example, page one of the "new york times" a week ago, page one this is a headline you can't make up. Irs focus on conservatives gives g.O.P. An issue to seize on. Irs 
-- now, come on. In other words, the story isn't the irs abuse, it's how is the g.O.P. Going to seize on this? I have two more examples. The associated press, you know, the gold standards of american journalism, so they write a story that says, the scandal is dogging president obama are political gift to republicans. But it's unclear how they are going to capital lis on this politically. Again, story is not about the abuse. The story is about how are republicans going to take advantage of it. And the third example is truly pathetic. It happened on msnbc, a contributor by the name of joy reid said that unless you're trying to form a tax exempt 501 c 4, this story isn't about you. The ignorance of that statement is breathtaking. If you are not trying to form a tax exempt organization, it's not about you? This is how far liberalism has fallen in this country. 
[00:35:00]



>> Bill: A couple of observations from me, your humble correspondent. Number one, candy crowley is the big kahuna as far as politics is ccerned at cnn. Covered the debate. Moderated the debate. She got criticized there for leaning toward obama, we all remember. 
>> Right. 
>> Bill: It seemed that she was promoting. She didn't 
-- she just didn't ask rand paul about 
-- could it have just been a mistake line lanny davis was saying earlier, hey, you know, maybe they just didn't know. Okay. But she, at the end with her comment was almost arguing with him and paul had a good answer, look, the ig would have pointed out it was a mistake, they say it was done on purpose, why are you sticking up for them. Candy comes back. If she is a commentator like you, goldberg and me, royale, she can could that all day long. As chief correspondent. Come on. The second thing is you can do a legitimate side bar on the republicans taking advantage of the story because surely they are. But the main story has to be is this credible? Did they do it and who did it? 
>> Exactly. 
>> I wanted people to know there is a legit story on the politics end but that's not your lead. 
>> Page one of the "new york times." This is not page 27. By the way, the main story, a day earlier was on page 11. So page 11 is where they tell the hard news story and page 1 is where they give the political spin. Can I make a point about something that you did last week on your show that i think is important to all of this? 
>> Bill: Sure. 
>> I wrote about this in a piece on my web site at bernard goldberg.Com that i hope people will look at. It's about the interview that one of your guys dan banks did on the street with people in manhattan. It was fascinating. I mean, he interviewed people about benghazi and a whole bunch of them never heard of benghazi. He intrifwd a college student who sen rolled at call berkeley, one of the typest schools in america who didn't know who the vice president of the united states is. These are precisely the kind of clueless people that barack obama is counting on because the mainstream media isn't going to further this story. Any of these sandals. The american people can't count on them. And as long as you have enough clueless people out there. 
[00:37:31]



>> Bill: We have them. 
>> Who don't care, who don't know, these are the people that will enable barack obama to get through these, as he has gotten through everything else, i believe. 
>> Bill: We have an interesting bill o'reilly.Com poll question for you, in your opinion, what situation is more damaging to the country, benghazi or the irs? Which is more damaging benghazi or the irs? Is it legal up next. We'll get their opinion of the james rosen situation.

>> Bill: Thanks for staying with us, I'm bill o'reilly. In the is it legal segment tonight, as we discussed with charles krauthammer, fox news correspondent james rosen had his private emails read without his knowledge by federal investigators. That should never have happened because mr. Rosen was simply reporting on a legit news story involving north korea. Here now attorneys and fox news analyst kimberly guilfoyle and lis wiehl. I understand fbi read rosen's emails than a longer time than they should have. 
>> The warrant gave them 30 days. In that 30 days they read emails spanning four months from may to august of 2010. 
>> Bill: He it didn't matter what period of time they had 30 days to read as many emails as they could? 
>> Exactly. 
>> Bill: Weren't they required by the warrant to tell rosen and fox news they were doing this. 
>> Yes, they were. What they said in the warrant we can't say anhing about this national security. The whole reason we are going after rosen and his source is because we are worried about classified information being disclosed. That's what they said. That's how they got around the law on it. They did get around the law. 
>> Bill: The judge said that this was okay what they were doing? 
>> The judge signed off on it. It's impossible for me to believe it I have seen the affidavit so I know there and he signed off on it. 
[00:42:57]



>> It's unauthorized. It's illegal. Infringement of a reporter's legitimate interest in obtaining information whether it's classified or not. That's what reporters do. So he didn't commit any criminal act. 
>> Both of you as astute attorneys. The judge alan kay. Federal judge. Federal magistrate judge sitting in virginia, is that where he is sitting or in d.C. 
>> I believe it's d.C. I'm not 100% sure about that. 
>> Bill: Both said the judge was wrong in giving the fbi. 
>> To be fair to the judge the fbi gave this information. 
>> I'm not going to be fair to the judge. I want to know who is at fault here. If the judge' is at fault and this is a will he jis mat news story whether north korea is going to test a missile in response to a u.N. Sanction. 
>> Is he doing his job. 
>> Who is doing his job? 
>> Rosen is doing his job. 
>> But the judge is not doing his job because the just just said we are not going to give you this broad power. 
>> The judge should not have signed off on it? 
>> They said probable cause exception to the privacy protection act. 
>> Bill: That's what they said about the a.P. Too. 
>> They are totally wrong. What I'm saying to you it is overreach and shouldn't have been done to begin with he should have been notified and fox news should have been telling you about they ran around it. 
>> Reporters are prosecuted for information. 
>> Bill: You both agree the judge made a mistake, should not have given the fbi and then we have got to find out from holder who doesn't know anything about anything. 
>> Ever. 
>> Bill: Why this was national security and all of that. 
>> Right. But also james rosen, i emailed with him tonight he told me that even his parents' home phone records in staten island were taken. So when you talk about overreaching here. 
>> Can you 
-- read email for a month, come on. That's intrusion. 
>> The department of justice is the one guilty of the crime. 
>> Go from a serious story to not so serious a lot of people are interested in this jodi arias. Here is what she said today. She is pleading for her life now, go. 
>> I make many public statements but I would prefer the death penalty to life in prison. Each time I said it, though I meant it I lacked perspective. I I stand here now I can't in good conscience ask to you sentence me to death because of them. Asking for death is tantamount to suicide have don't put my to death because my family will devastated. The jury deliberations begin tomorrow on whether to give her death or not. Do you agree with guilfoyle wiehl. 
[00:45:29]



>> I don't think she will get the death penalty. Because less than 2% of women, people on death row. 
>> Bill: Can we make a bet of some kind that would be entertaining. 
>> If she loses I get all of her dresses. 
>> Wait a second. 
>> What do I get? 
>> Bill: If you lose what does she get. 
>> My old is it legal mess. 
>> Get all the dresses if she wins I get nothing. 
>> If wiehl wins she gets nothing. 
>> Is it legal note. Write a book. 
>> Bill: That's the logic they bring to the five. 
>> That's probably the problem. Thanks very much. We will take you back to oklahoma to talk to a woman who helped save the lives of a child who is in deep distress. That after these messages.

>> Bill: Back in the segment tonight the as we told at the beginning, 24 people are confirmed dead in oklahoma because the killer tornado. Death toll included nine children. Joining us know from james and mr. Moody. You live in a house that was across the street that was hit by the tornado. But when the tornado was coming to you toward your house, you have three little kids, six, eight and ten and two girls. What did you guys do when the tornado was coming at you? 
>> Well, I get my kids to the storm shelter. As a typical former nurse, outside videotaping the tornado. We see it coming and we all get into the shelter and lock the shelter door. 
>> Bill: So you had the storm shelter that saved a lot of lives were. Your children 
-- how scared were they? Did you have trouble controlling them down in the shelter? 
>> To be honest, sir, I think i caused more than they did. I had to apologize to my children because it was terrifying. I think they did a really good job and I'm really proud of my kids, but the time that it debate the most concerning is when the debris started coming into the storm shelter. We were getting covered with debris. 
>> Bill: How long were you in the shelter? 
>> I would probably say about ten minutes. 
>> Bill: So then you come up, your house is pretty much destroyed. You look across the street and the school is destroyed and there are kids in trouble over there. Tell us about that. 
>> Well, they are screaming and yelling and just hysteria. People are rushing towards the school. Took my children down in the storm cellar with another sixth grade girl and she watched over them and ran over there to see if I could be help. Teachers were bleeding and swept off their seats. There was a car that had fallen in the middle of the halt way and children were trapped underneath the car. Men were pulling girls and boys out from underneath this car. I felt it was a privilege, the privilege of being able to carry a little girl out with the help of another teacher and moved out from all the debris and got her to the triage. 
[00:52:10]



>> Bill: Very heroic of you. Seven children didn't make it oust that school, I understand. 
>> Mr. Moody, you were trying to get home. Tell us about your ordeal. 
>> They let it's go from work early to help us be safe. And the tornado was going to directly hit the house, i immediately got in the car and i knew if I came up on the east side of the tornado I would be safe. When I got to 945 the tornado had crossed over 35. So I jumped off the highway and went through the streets until i got quarter mile from the house. Couldn't get any farther. Jumped out and ran. Whenever I got, I saw my children and my wife. I knew everything was okay at that point. They were safe. Everything else was going to be all right. 
>> Bill: It must have been an ordeal with you. You weren't in touch with your wife and you didn't know what was going on, right? 
>> That is correct. The only communication I had received was about 15 minutes before I saw them. She said everything was gone. 
>> Bill: Listen, we really are happy that you are altogether. Children are fine. They are reunited and build, anything we can do you let us know. Thank you for telling your story tonight. 
>> Thank you, bill.

>> Bill: On the elites let yourself know how we should spend our mope. Who the we, are you running a golden girls fanfare or not. Spending that jack, $1.9 million on a stupid painting is stupid which it is. I also said that kind of cash could help a lot of severely wounded vets.

Let's all cut down on ear pollution. Don't write me a letter saying I'm going to cut down by ear pollution by not watching the factor. That is it for tonight.

R to you talk about the irs and anything elgs. Gretawire.Com, see you tomorrow night. Strong. O'reilly is up right now. 
>> Bill: The o'reilly factor is on. Tonight: 
>> How did this happen? 
>> Mr. Chairman, I can't say that I know that answer. 
>> Once again they don't know. The former chief of the irs says he has no idea why conservatives were targeted. This on the heels of the attorney general saying he has no idea why the justice department is snooping around reporters. 
>> I don't know what happened there about interaction between the a.P. And the justice ment. I was recused from the case. 
>> And president obama saying he has no idea how benghazi got so screwed up. 
>> We were not clear who exactly had carried it out and how it occurred and what the motivations were. 
>> Bill: Tonight charles krauthammer and I will analyze the see no evil strategies. 
>> We had to pull a car out of the front hallway off a teacher and she 
-- I don't know what that lady's name is but she had three little kids underneath her good job teach. 
>> Bill: Lead story is oklahoma where the suffering is immense. We will take you there life and tell you some dramatic stories. 
>> 
>> everything is gone but the important things are alive. 
>> Bill: Caution, you are about to enter the no spin zone. The factor begins rig now 
>> hi, I'm bill o'reilly, thanks for watching us tonight. Busy live program for you. In a few moments we have analyst from charles krauthammer about the continuing irs fiasco and that's what it is. The feds snooping around fox news correspondent james rosen. But first the lead story tonight, the killer tornado in oklahoma. Right now the death toll stands at 24. Hundreds injured after a fierce twister hit oklahoma yesterday. At least nine children have died seven of them trapped in an elementary school. Reports say they drowned in the basement. Tornado hit moore, oklahoma, a community of more than 50,000, about 10 miles south of oklahoma city. This is the fourth time in 15 years that moore has been battered by a tornado. And it was just two years ago almost to the day that a brutal tornado destroyed joplin, missouri, 158 died in that storm. Now, reports say yesterday's tornado hit with more power than the atom bombs that were dropped on japan. 
[00:02:32]



>> We're watching this tornado. It is still on the ground it's a huge cyclone. 
>> You have to be underground or get away from the storm. It's a freight train and it's coming through moore right now. 
>> You guys need to get on the ground now. >>S is horrible! , It's horrible! Oh my god. 
>> This is not good. Please, dear god. Please keep these people safe. 
>> This is amazing, amazing tornado. This is just a deadly situation really. Damage in the billions. Human suffering impossible to calculate. 
>> There were people crawling out from everywhere and anywhere. Basically just a war zone. 
>> Now everything is just gone. These are my friends' houses. Really sad and scary and take so long to rebuild. 
>> When I got home i realized that there is nothing left of my house. 
>> I came out and I saw the cars and I saw the houses and I just started crying so hard. A light went down and hit me in the head and all the other girls were screaming and they were crying. 
>> Some of our dearest friends' children we thought were in the school trapped. 
>> So scary. And a lot of my friends were still there when i left. 
>> Oh my god, I was praying to god so many times and I 
-- honestly I'm like I'm not going to see tomorrow. I was just like I don't want to die today. 
>> And joining us now from moore, oklahoma, fox news correspondent john roberts. John, have you been covering the story all day. What has made the deepest impression on you? 
>> Bill, I think it was what you just heard right there. And it was the deaths of those nine children. Seven of them at an elementary school that is just a few blocks over from where I am standing, the plaza towers elementary school. You know, any loss of life, in a tragedy like this is heart-breaking. But when it is children, and when those children are in school, it's particularly heart breaking. You send your child off to school in the morning and i talked with governor fallon about this just a few minutes ago. You send your child off to school in the morning, you think that it's going to be a safe place. And then by the afternoon, by 3:00 in the afternoon, that safe place that you thought you were sending your child to is suddenly rent asunder like pancake and seven children have died. Just to add a little bit to the reporting. Governor fallon and I were speaking about this idea of whether or not children drowned in the basement. She said that there were so initial reports that there was a basement at that school but she said that upon further examination there wasn't a basement. So the idea of children drowning on the grod floor is something that we're looking into. It doesn't quite make sense on the surface, bill. Maybe that they just suffered blunt force trauma when the walls came down. And here is a particularly gut wrenching aspect to the whole thing. That the children were sent to the cafeteria according to the associated press tornado warnings were first put'. Then when the sirens hit school officials said get out of the cafeteria. Go into the hallways to take shelter. Children were told to hug the walls and that's when those walls came tumbling down. 
[00:05:47]



>> Bill: You know what's interesting. 
>> Heart breaking to think what happened. 
>> Bill: As the story unfolds, as we mentioned, this is the fourth time that moore, the town of moore has been hit since 1999 with a fierce tornado. I wonder if the public school and private school officials have a plan when the tornado rolls through? Now, you say the school didn't have a basement. And then the kids were left relegated to go to the hallway, which isn't much protection from atom bomb type storm. I'm wondering whether 
-- you know, in this area and other areas in the midwest that are prone to getting tornadoes they are going to have to, you know, either big basements or things like that. That's a line of reporting that we'll do. Now, as far as you are concerned. Go ahead, john. 
>> 
>> I was going to say and i should point out, bill, that the newer schools that were built here in moore, oklahoma city, norman oklahoma, they all have safe rooms or they have stabbed alone tornado shelters. But briar wood a little bit further north of here and plaza towers were old schools. They were built in the 1960s. They were cinder block and bring and then they had the flat roofs with metal trusses. It wasn't required back then for them to have a safe room or tornado shelter. The only thing there to protecthe kid were those cinder block walls and you put that much force on them they collapse like a house of cards. 
>> When you talk to the people live in moore because of all the tornado activity and the devastation now, are they giving up on their town? I mean, are they thinking about moving away? 
>> Not at all. I this I we came across one person who said they are done with oklahoma. It's too difficult living in tornado alley. All the other people that i talked to throughout the course of the day whose houses were blown away. They only survived because they were in their own tornado shelter whether it be in the backyard or one woman I met shannon wilson she 11 months ago spent the money to have a tornado shelter built in the floor of her garage, said it was the best money that she ever spent. 
[00:07:49]



>> Bill: Sure. 
>> She is going to rebuild her house and use that tornado shelter as the centerpiece for the house. 
>> Bill: We appreciate it very much. Have more on the tornado coverage with a woman who actually saved one of the kids in the elementary school that john was talking about. That will be a bit later on. Next on the run down it took just hours before the global warming people ran out screaming about the tornado. We have a report on that. Charles krauthammer and i will analyze the growing irs scandal. Now, one of the big shots there expected to take the fifth. Those reports after these messages. end but a friend under water is something completely different. I met a turtle friend today so, you don't get that very often.

>> When cyclones tear up oklahoma and hurricanes alabama and wildfires scorch texas, you come to us, the rest of the country for billions of dollars to recover. 
>> And the damage that your polluters and deniers are doing doesn't just hit oklahoma and alabama and texas. It hits rhode island with floods and storms. 
>> Bill: Joining us now from harrisburg, pennsylvania to comment weather guy joe bastardi who is not a believer in the global warming theory. A storm like this does raise questions about what's going on in the atmosphere, does it not? 
[00:12:27]



>> Well, there have been major tornadoes before, as a smask, the charts of the major tornadoes show they have been decreasing over the years. They reached their peak in THE 50S, SIX AND 70s. If you remember during the 70s WE WERE IN A GLOBAL Cooling scare. I'm not here to demean anybody. I will debunk them with facts though. This is not the first time we have heard this situation comments made, it's almost like ambulance chasing after these devastating events that cause misery to people. And then trying to tie an agenda into it. About five years ago I came on your show, bill, and told you we were going into a time of climatic hardship because of the shift in the cycle in the pacific to cooler while the atlantic was still warm. This happened in the 1950s. It's why the 19 autos were so volatile with the tremendous tornado activity. The heat and drought in the center of the country and, of course, the hurricane activity up the easrn seaboard were white house seems to be ignorant of his own state of rhode island was hit four times in the 1950s, 8 hurricanes 19534 to 1960, just what do you think is going to happen if the same pattern shows up again? You are seeing the same things happen in alaska than did in the earl little 1950s and core reand a europe. You have a very similar pattern. And it produces, you know, the united states is only one.5% of the globe. So, produces this type of weather. The problem too is we have some more people living in the southern united states than we did in the 1950s. I went to oklahoma city. 
>> This storm that we are looking at right now, that's one of the most powerful tornadoes ever to hit the u.S.A., Right? 
>> Yeah. It is. There is no question. But, the 19125 tri-state tornado had a path of 180 miles from missouri into indiana, it was two miles wide. When you go back and look at the history and the death of the tornado death, which have been decase, a large part to noaa and storm chasers seeing all these things before that happened. You didn't have that before going on before. You understand people are living in harm's way. In 1962, oklahoma city moore was south of oklahoma city like it is now. But it's a much smaller town then. People living in harm's way and this goes through all the east coast. 
[00:14:49]



>> This is all throughout the midwest. The only solution there it isn't a solution because nature is nature. Whether there is global warming or isn't. You are going to have bad storms and that's that. You have got to build those shelters if you are in the middle of the country. You have got to have those underground escape facilities, correct? 
>> There is no question about that or the other option is that in a high risk day, like yesterday, you treat he it like a snow day. You do in the east where kids aren't all bunched in one center. 
>> Bill: They knew that this was a volatile environment now. So you say that everybody should have just said stay home, it's too unsettled here? 
>> No. What I'm saying is maybe that's a solution but, look, there is a price you pay for every step you take. 
>> Bill: And everywhere you live. 
>> Bury yourself in a corner? You live on long island, you know darn well what happened in the 1930s and 40s. 
>> I know what happened six months ago. We got whacked by sandy. You are right, you are right. But sum it up, joe because I have got to go. You believe this is just nature and this is just the natural order of things, correct? 
>> It is right out of the 19 autos. The pacific is cooling. The atlantic is still warm. Look to the 1950s and you will find a similar weather pattern. Yes, sir. 
>> Thanks very much. Directly ahead, charles krauthammer and I will analyze the amazing irs scandal. And I have a talking points memo on how president obama is handling it. That moments away. terry pain. I worked a patrol unit for 17 years in the city of baltimore. When I first started experiencing the pain, it's, it's hard to describe because you have a numbness... But yet you have the pain like thousands of needles sticking in your foot. It was progressively getting worse, and at that point I knew I had to do something. When I went back to my healthcare professional... That's when she suggested the lyrica. Once I started taking the lyrica, the pain started subsiding.

[00:19:45]



>> Bill: All the controversies in washington. According to a allergy an in the "new york times." Obama told confidants he would like to going bull worth. A complete phony. Toward the end of the film the senator has an epif fannie and decides to tell the truth. 
>> We can't get health insurance. Fire insurance. Life insurance, why haven't you come out why haven't you come out 
-- 
>> well, you haven't really contributed any money to my campaign, have you? [Boos] 
>> you got any idea how many these insurance companies come up with? They pretty much depend on me to get a bill like that and bottle it up in my committee during an election and then that way we can kill it when you are not looking. 
>> Bill: Now, as an american citizen, want president obama to go bullworth. To actually tell us what he thinks. Especially about the controversies in benghazi with the irs, and the justice department snooping around reporters. But so far the president is doing a great imitation of the late actor john banner. 
>> I see nothing. I was not here. I did 
-- get up this morning. I see nothing. 
>> Bill: Here is how bad the lack of information really is when chris wallace asked where the president was the night ambassador stevens was killed in benghazi, he didn't get very far. 
>> Do you not know whether he was in 
-- 
>> 
-- I don't remember what room the president was in on that night. That's a largely irrelevant fact. 
>> Bill: No, it's not. Americans want to know where the commander and chief was while his ambassador and three other americans were being killed. That is a valid question. Today, former irs chief doug shulman testified before the senate but predictably he doesn't know anything about targeting conservatives. 
[00:21:46]



>> How did this happen? 
>> Mr. Chairman, I can't say 
-- I can't say that i know that answer. I have now had the benefit of reading the report. And that's, you know, the full accounting of facts that I have at this point and so I 
-- I don't think can I answer that question. 
>> I don't know. Nobody, nobody can answer any questions. Do you sense a pattern here? If you are a fair minded person, the obama administration is becoming a frustrating experience, is it not just tell us what happened, mr. President. Stop dancing around. We don't need a replay of watergate. 
>> This is not watergate but there are some people in the administration who have acted as if they want to be nixonian. And that's a very big problem. 
>> Bill: Yes, it's big problem. Mr. President let's go bulworth tell us the truth. That's the memo. Now interesting information on the irs story. As you know president obama said he learned about the scandal on may 10th. White house council kathryn ruemmler apparently knew about it on april 24th and so did white house chief of staff dennis mcdonough. Treasury secretary jack lew knew about the irs investigation on march 15. But, again, mr. Obama knew nothing until may 10th. Joining us now from washington, fox news political analyst charles krauthammer. And you say? 
>> Well, the president says everybody has to tell the truth. I was on this show last week thursday, the day the president answered questions from the press while standing next to the prime minister of turkey. There was a question asked by the bloomberg reporter. Did anybody at the white house know about the irs activities? And do you remember my saying on the show that time with you, that obama gave a very lawyerly and peculiar answer. He did not answer about the white house staff. He said I didn't know about the ig report until i learned about it in the press the question was not about him. The question was about the white house staff. And he deliberately dodged that answer. Now we know that when he was asked that question last thursday, he knew at the time that his staff did know about it, the press story from jay carney was only the white house counsel knew about is it but it turns out as you showed the staff chief of staff knew they were discussing how to let the story out. All this activity is going on. The president knows that they knew but he doesn't answer the question. That wasn't a lie. But that was a deliberate suppression of the truth. 
[00:24:42]



>> Evasion. 
>> And this from a man who somehow leaks to to the times the idea that he is now only interested in everybody on his staff coming out and saying what they know. Why didn't he say what he knew when that question was asked of him last thursday. 
>> Bill: They are not interested in telling anybody anything. We know the answer to that now tomorrow lois lerner, the head of irs exempter organizations division is going to testify and appantly she is going to take the fifth amendment in front of the house oversight committee. This is huge. Now we're into creettle. Criminality. She didn't commit any crime she is going to take the fifth amendment anyway. This is building isn't it. 
>> When anybody takes the fifth in front of congress we impute 
-- it's not unreasonable that there is a lot they have got to hide and they are very worried. Yes, in acourt of law the jury is not supposed to impute that, but this isn't a court of law. 
>> Bill: No, this is the media and I'm wondering why this person is taking the fifth amendment. 
>> We are citizens making reasonable inferences that there is very nasty stuff here. And the reason there is more oxygen here is because the head of that committee, the one that held the hearings today that you showed in the clip, is a democrat. This is max baucus, the democratic chair of the senate finance committee. The senate controlled by democrats who said this story is very, very unusual and this there is a lot he said yesterday when he submitted 41 questions to the irs. Including did you have any communications about this with treasury or with the white house? 
>> Bill: Right. 
>> He said my gut tells me there is a lot here. Can you no longer have the white house pretending as it does with benghazi that this is a partisan witch-hunt. This is democratic. 
[00:26:44]



>> Bill: This is getting huge. 
>> Bill: I'm going to give charles 45 more seconds because I want you to weigh in on james rosen. Rosen investigating a story about north korea retaliating to u.N. Sanctions by testing missiles. All right? That's what he was doing. Justice department wants to find out whose rosen's source is for this information. Goes in and looks at james' personal email account for about, almost a month. What do you say about that? 
>> This is a brazen assault on the first amendment. Freedom of the press. We traditionally will go after the emails of a person who is under criminal suspicion for leaking it. But we do not go after the journalists who merely are soliciting information. We have never had a successful prosecution of a journalist. 
>> Bill: Do you see an anti-fox play here? 
>> Look, I don't know whether in this particular case it was anti-fox. But it surely was an assault on the press. And we also know that from the beginning of this administration the white house starting with the president has tried to delegitimize fox and pretend somehow it's outside the sphere of journalistic integrity and protection so the fish 
-- 
>> Bill: This is all under the attorney general, all right, and he can't recuse himself from this so let's hear what you have to say, mr. Attorney general. 
>> To quote a democrat. The fish rots from the head. 
>> Bill: We have more on the controversy surrounding fox news and james rosen with our is it legal team in just a few moments. But directly ahead. Bernie goldberg on how cnn is covering the controversies in washington. Bernie is next. were jobs available out there. I knew DeVry university would give me the skills that I needed to make one of those tech jobs mine.

Many choose us because we have the largest 4GLTE network. Others, because of our reputation for reliability. Or maybe it's because we've received JD Power and Associates' customer service award 4X in a row. In the end, there are countless reasons. But one choi. Weekdays with bernie segment tonight. We believe the benghazi, the irs, and the a.P. Snooping around has been fair. If you disagree, please let me know by email. Over at cnn,hey have not covered those stories all that much. And there is a slightly sceptic call tone. 
[00:32:16]



>> Can you see in your mind's eye a way that this might not have been political, that this was a misguided stud way to sort but that they didn't intend it to be some kind of political attempt to harass the tea party? 
>> I would think that if there was any chance that this was a mistake the investigator general wouldn't be coming out and saying otherwise. And the irs themselves wouldn't be admitting. 
>> They say it's a mistake the question is whether it's political. 
>> Bill: Yesterday I talked with bernie goldberg about the cnn situation. 
>> Anything wrong with ms. Crowley's posture? 
>> You know what? I'm not going to lose much sleep over her asking was it a mistake instead of being political. She gave him a chance tone a it does fall into the broad category of a reporter asking a scientist is it possible that the earth is flat because the chances of the earth being flat are exactly the same as the irs thing being simply a mistake but, bill, there is something much bigger going on here, it's how the mainstream media, so-called mainstream media covers scan tells in general. Finance a prib republican scandal it's always covered as a scandal. If it's a democratic scandal it's covered as how are these cynical republicans are going to take advantage of this for political points? A classic example, page one of the "new york times" a week ago, page one this is a headline you can't make up. Irs focus on conservatives gives g.O.P. An issue to seize on. Irs 
-- now, come on. In other words, the story isn't the irs abuse, it's how is the g.O.P. Going to seize on this? I have two more examples. The associated press, you know, the gold standards of american journalism, so theyrite a story that says, the scandal is dogging president obama are political gift to republicans. But it's unclear how they are going to capital lis on this politically. Again, story is not about the abuse. The story is about how are republicans going to take advantage of it. And the third example is truly pathetic. It happened on msnbc, a contributor by the name of joy reid said that unless you're trying to form a tax exempt 501 c 4, this story isn't about you. The ignorance of that statement is breathtaking. If you are not trying to form a tax exempt organization, it's not about you? This is how far liberalism has fallen in this country. 
[00:34:59]



>> Bill: A couple of observations from me, your humble correspondent. Number one, candy crowley is the big kahuna as far as politics is concerned at cnn. Covered the debate. Moderated the debate. She got criticized there for leaning toward obama, we all remember. 
>> Right. 
>> Bill: It seemed that she was promoting. She didn't 
-- she just didn't ask rand paul about 
-- could it have just been a mistake line lanny davis was saying earlier, hey, you know, maybe they just didn't know. Okay. But she, at the end with her comment was almost arguing with him and paul had a good answer, look, the ig would have pointed out it was a mistake, they say it was done on purpose, why are you sticking up for them. Candy comes back. If she is a commentator like you, goldberg and me, royale, she can could that all day long. As chief correspondent. Come on. The second thing is you can do a legitimate side bar on the republicans taking advantage of the story because surely they are. But the main story has to be is this credible? Did they do it and who did it? 
>> Exactly. 
>> I wanted people to know there is a legit story on the politics end but that's not your lead. 
>> Page onef the "new york times." This is not page 27. By the way, the main story, a day earlier was on page 11. So page 11 is where they tell the hard news story and page 1 is where they give the political spin. Can I make a point about something that you did last week on your show that i think is important to all of this? 
>> Bill: Sure. 
>> I wrote about this in a piece on my web site at bernard goldberg.Com that i hope people will look at. It's about the interview that one of your guys dan banks did on the street with people in manhattan. It was fascinating. I mean, he interviewed people about benghazi and a whole bunch of them never heard of benghazi. He intriewd a college student who sen rolled at call berkeley, one of the typest schools in america who didn't know who the vice president of the united states i these are precisely the kind of clueless people that barack obama is counting on because the mainstream media isn't going to further this story. Any of these sandals. The american people can't count on them. And as long as you have enough clueless people out there. 
[00:37:30]



>> Bill: We have them. 
>> Who don't care, who don't know, these are the people that will enable barack obama to get through these, as he has gotten through everything else, i believe. 
>> Bill: We have an interesting bill o'reilly.Com poll question for you, in your opinion, what situation is more damaging to the country, benghazi or the irs?

>> Bill: Thanks for staying with us, I'm bill o'reilly. In the is it legal segment tonight, as we discussed with charles krauthammer, fox news correspondent james rosen had his private emails read without his knowledge by federal investigators. That should never have happened because mr. Rosen was simply reporting on a legit news story involving north korea. Here now attorneys and fox news analyst kimberly guilfoyle and lis wiehl. I understand fbi read rosen's emails than a longer time than they should have. 
>> The warrant gave them 30 days. In that 30 days they read emails spanning four months from may to august of 2010. 
>> Bill: He it didn't matter what period of time they had 30 days to read as many emails as they could? 
>> Exactly. 
>> Bill: Weren't they required by the warrant to tell rosen and fox news they were doing this. 
>> Yes, they were. What they said in the warrant we can't say anything about this national security. The whole reason we are going after rosen and his source is because we are worried about classified information being disclosed. That's what they said. That's how they got around the law on it. They did get around the law. 
>> Bill: The judge said that this was okay what they were doing? 
>> The judge signed off on it. It's impossible for me to believe it I have seen the affidavit so I know there and he signed off on it. 
>> It's unauthorized. It's illegal. Infringement of a reporter's legitimate interest in obtaining information whether it's classified or not. That's what reporters do. So he didn't commit any criminal act. 
>> Both of you as astute attorneys. The judge alan kay. Federal judge. Federal magistrate judge sitting in virginia, is that where he is sitting or in d.C. 
[00:43:20]



>> I believe it's d.C. I'm not 100% sure about that. >>ill: BOTH SAID THE Judge was wrong in giving the fbi. 
>> To be fair to the judge the fbi gave this information. 
>> I'm not going to be fair to the judge. I want to know who is at fault here. If the judge' is at fault and this is a will he jis mat news story whether north korea is going to test a missile in response to a u.N. Sanction. 
>> Is he doing his job. 
>> Who is doing his job? 
>> Rosen is doing his job. 
>> But the judge is not doing his job because the just just said we are not going to give you this broad power. 
>> The judge should not have signed off on it? 
>> They said probable cause exception to the privacy protection act. 
>> Bill: That's what they said about the a.P. Too. 
>> They are totally wrong. What I'm saying to you it is overreach and shouldn't have been done to begin with he should have been notified and fox news should have been telling you about they ran around it. 
>> Reporters are prosecuted for information. 
>> Bill: You both agree the judgade a mistake, should not have given the fbi and then we have got to find out from holder who doesn't know anything about anything. 
>> Ever. 
>> Bill: Why this was national security and all of that. 
>> Right. But also james rosen, i emailed with him tonight he told me that even his parents' home phone records in staten island were taken. So when you talk about overreaching here. 
>> Can you 
-- read email for a month, come on. That's intrusion. 
>> The department of justice is the one guilty of the crime. 
>> Go from a serious story to not so serious a lot of people are interested in this jodi arias. Here is what she said today. She is pleading for her life now, go. 
>> I make many public statements but I would prefer the death penalty to life in prison. Each time I said it, though I meant it I lacked perspective. I I stand here now I can't in good conscience ask to you sentence me to death because of them. Asking for death is tantamount to suicide have don't put my to death because my family will devastated. The jury deliberations begin tomorrow on whether to give her death or not. Do you agree with guilfoyle wiehl. 
[00:45:28]



>> I don't think she will get the death penalty. Because less than 2% of women, people on death row. 
>> Bill: Can we make a bet of some kind that would be entertaining. 
>> If she loses I get all of her dresses. 
>> Wait a second. 
>> What do I get? 
>> Bill: If you lose what does she get. 
>> My old is it legal mess. 
>> Get all the dresses if she wins I get nothing. 
>> If wiehl wins she gets nothing. 
>> Is it legal note. Write a book. 
>> Bill: That's the logic they bring to the five. 
>> That's probably the problem. Thanks very much. We will take you back to oklahoma to talk to a woman who helped save the lives of a child who is in deep distress. That after these messages. new program you get 5% back, on everything. Everything. Everything. Everything. Everything?

>> Bill: Back in the segment tonight the as we told at the beginning, 24 people are confirmed dead in oklahoma because the killer tornado. Death toll included nine children. Joining us know from james and mr. Moody. You live in a house that was across the street that was hit by the tornado. But when the tornado was coming to you toward your house, you have three little kids, six, eigh and ten and two girls. What did you guys do when the tornado was coming at you? 
>> Well, I get my kids to the storm shelter. As a typical former nurse, outside videotaping the tornado. We see it coming and we all get into the shelter and lock the shelter door. 
>> Bill: So you had the storm shelter that saved a lot of lives were. Your children 
-- how scared were they? Did you have trouble controlling them down in the shelter? 
>> To be honest, sir, I think i caused more than they did. I had to apologize to my children because it was terrifying. I think they did a really good job and I'm really proud of my kids, but the time that it debate the most concerning is when the debris started coming into the storm shelter. We were getting covered with debris. 
>> Bill: How long were you in the shelter? 
>> I would probably say about ten minutes. 
>> Bill: So then you come up, your house is pretty much destroyed. You look across the street and the school is destroyed and there are kids in trouble over there. Tell us about that. 
>> Well, they are screaming and yelling and just hysteria. People are rushing towards the school. I took my children down in the storm cellar with another sixth grade girl and she watched over them and ran over there to see if I could be help. Teachers were bleeding and swept off their seats. There was a car that had fallen in the middle of the halt way and children were trapped underneath the car. Men were pulling girls and boys out from underneath this car. I felt it was a privilege, the privilege of being able to carry a little girl out with the help of another teacher and moved out from all the debris and got her to the triage. 
[00:52:09]



>> Bill: Very heroic of you. Seven children didn't make it oust that school, I understand. 
>> Mr. Moody, you were trying to get home. Tell us about your ordeal. 
>> They let it's go from work early to help us be safe. And the tornado was going to directly hit the house, i immediately got in the car and i knew if I came up on the east side of the tornado I would be safe. When I got to 945 the tornado had crossed over 35. So I jumped off the highway and went through the streets until i got quarter mile from the house. Couldn't get any farther. Jumped out and ran. Whenever I got, I saw my children and my wife. I knew everything was okay at that point. They were safe. Everything else was going to be all right. 
>> Bill IT MUST HAVE BEEN AN Ordeal with you. You weren't in touch with your wind you didn't know what was going on, right? 
>> That is correct. The only communication I had received was about 15 minutes before I saw them. She said everything was gone. 
>> Bill: Listen, we really are happy that you are altogether. Children are fine. They are reunited and build, anything we can do you let us know. Thank you for telling your story tonight. 
>> Thank you, bill.

=======================================================

To compared to what we were told last night that authorities say many of the victims were inadvertently counted twice last month in the chaos of the tornado's immediate aftermath. Even with the lower number today, authorities are still cautioning they expect the overall death toll may still rise if more victims are found. All night long last night and all throughout the day today emergency responders have been combing through the debris block by block, car by car. You can see markings they use. Orange x means no victims inside this vehicle. Emergency crews can move on. In terms of whether or not there's hope for finding anybody else alive, the fire chief in moore, oklahoma, today said he is 98% sure that there are no more survivors to recover. He says that every damaged home in the city has been searched at least once already. He says the fire chief's goal is to have three searches of every destroyed property just to be 100% sure that no one has been left behind. 
>> We are out. We started with a primary search yesterday and secondary search. We made it through most of the structures, most of the vehicles, most of the homes, the ones that we didn't make it through yesterday we'll make it through today for sure and a second and third time we'll be through every damaged piece of property in this city at least three times before we're done and we hope to be done by dark tonight. 
>> First and foremost emergency and goal is to have rescue and recovery to make sure that uncovered every piece of debris and gone through every building, piece of land itself to see if there might be someone that survived the storm or experienced some injuries itself. 
>> If there's anybody out there, citizens that have not found loved ones, we would ask them to call us and report that and let us have the opportunity maybe to locate them. 
[00:02:01]



>> Let people know you're okay. One of the challenges with this type of event because the devastation is so bad, it's difficult to get a handle on how many people may be missing. If you did live in the areas and you were impacted, let people know you are okay so we're not looking for people we don't need to be looking for. 
>> Search and rescue teams are going through every individual house looking for everything and anything and if they need to, they take the dogs in also. 
>> Emergency crews have been bringing in rescue dogs and cadaver dogs to help search through the rubble, to listen for and to sniff for victims, to climb and burrow in places that human rescuers may not be able to reach. First responders have been getting assistance from the oklahoma national guard and the oklahoma air national guard. Those troops have been able to assist not only just with sheer manpower and things like perimeter security but also with specific equipment, specific technical equipment that they have to try to find people. 
>> A team of eight individuals tactical vehicles and a lot of our equipment that we would use in combat operations such as thermal imageers, night vision equipment, communications equipment. We're here at ground zero basically looking to get put into the search and rescue portion to go out with thermal imageers and see in the dark and hopefully find survivors. Thermal imageers allow us to see cold, warm bodies, people in the dark. Night vision equipment we can see in the dark. Low light instances. 
>> We talked with the oahoma air national guard today. They described to us their thermal imageers that you heard that soldier describing there. They are a handheld device or you can mount it on any sort of device but it's small enough to hold in your hand. It gives you a black and white image. This one you are looking at here is a thermal imaging device that's not the exact equipment the guard is using. A similar device that you can buy. In the field it shows what the soldier right next to you might look like if you were looking through that thermal scanner, that thermal imaging device at that person. It's a different look. Totally different function from what you would see if you were wearing night vision goggles where everything looks that familiar shade of green. One shot I want to show you of airmen from the oklahoma air national guard using one of these thermal imaging devices last night when they were going house to house in moore, oklahoma, looking for survivors. Watch. 
[00:04:29]



>> If you need to switch, just let me know. 
>> This is a team from the oklahoma air national guard. They were also part of the search and rescue team at the plaza towers elementary school, which of course was completely destroyed yesterday in a direct hit from the tornado. We've had no further reports today on the progress of the search at plaza towers elementary. A number of older grades of kids were known to be saved but there were looming questions all day yesterday and through the night and now into today about the fate of the kids in the younger grades including all of the way down to kindergarten. Associated press photographer published her own account today of what she saw when she reached plaza towers elementary yesterday afternoon. She got there shortly after the storm and says she expected a scene of chaos but instead she says "it was calm and orderly as police and firefighters pulled children out one by one from beneath a large chunk of a collapsed wall. Parents and neighborhood volunteers stood in a line and passed the rescued children from one set of arms to another carrying them out of harm's way. Adults carried the children through a field littered with shredded pieces of wood, cinder block and insulation to a triage center in a parking lot. They worked quickly and quietly so rescuers could hear voices of children trapped beneath the rubble. For a moment there was hope in the devastation." In the half hour that photographer was outside that destroyed elementary school yesterday right after the storm passed, she said she saw rescuers pull about a dozen children alive from the rubble. There has been no word from anyone yet of further rescues today. The national weather service estimating this afternoon that yesterday's tornado rated ef-5. They say yesterday's oklahoma tornado had winds of at least 200 miles per hour. There's a lot that officials will have to do to rebuild from a storm of this magnitude. Not just houses and schools and power lines and maybe water treatment plants and cell phone towers. They started on what would seem like a smaller thing which is replacing street signs. It turns out it's necessary in the very short-term to help give first responders and some residents some sense in this now unfamiliar landscape of exactly where they are when they are in moore, oklahoma. President obama saying this morning that he's instructing his disaster response team to get tornado victims in oklahoma everything they need "right away." Fema administrator craig fugate is on the ground in oklahoma today. What emergency responders need most is to try to stop the clock as everybody worries everyone may not find anymore victims of yesterday's disaster. Joining us now is the mayor. I know this is a busy night for you. Thank you. 
[00:07:28]



>> Thank you, rachel. The end of a long day. 
>> What can you tell us about the latest in terms of search and rescue efforts in moore. We're hearing overall that the worry is that rescue efforts will have to wind down shortly if not now because of passage of time. Do you expect they'll still find any survivors? 
>> No. No. I don't have any reason to expect that they'll find any survivors. I went into ground zero today and had to look at the most devastating parts myself and i can tell you it's unimaginable that anybody walked out of that debris alive. Debris four foot high as far as you can see and inside the debris school books and children's toys and cars standing on end. Sticks and pieces of wood just broken like match sticks out there. I don't see how people climbed out of that debris and lived to tell the stories but some remarkable stories are emerging from out of that chaos. I really think the most emotional aspects of this are yet to come. I think later in the week we're going to have to start burying kids that didn't survive that grade school and I think that's when it's really going to hit home just how tragic and horrible this event has been for oklahoma city. 
>> In terms of the major infrastructure in the city, there were initial reports yesterday about a water treatment plant being offline and that potentially posing some larger issues for the region. We later heard that maybe those initial reports had been overblown. Are there large scale infrastructure issues either in terms of water, gas, power, water treatment, sewage treatment, those kind of things that will have a regional impact? 
>> Power was out and so the water treatment plant lacked the power but power has now been restored and water levels are back to their normal pressure. As far as infrastructure goes, electricity is going to be out in many areas for quite some time. And so you're going to have a lot of situations where crews are coming in from aund the region to try to help our power company try to restore order in that respect. There's going to be a tremendous amount of cleanup and debris as far as the infrastructure goes and sometimes that's where the federal government's help can come in and aid from a long-term budgetary perspective. The insurance commissioner is also walking around. Talking damage here in the billions of dollars. That's going to have an economic impact in a lot of different ways. 
[00:09:57]



>> This obviously is an area of the country that has dealt with tornado devastation before. Sometimes on large scale like this. When you as the mayor of oklahoma city think about rebuilding, is there anything that you want to try to prioritize in terms of increasing the survivability of future storms and resilience of your communities and surrounding areas wn storms like thi inevity come back through again. 
>> This is the third time in 15 years. Oklahoma city has only had three significant tornadoes in that time, two really bad, the two really worse in our city's history, and they've all three come on almost an exact same axis across the same part of the city and part of the metro. We need to figure out why that's occurring if we can. Hopefully there's some sort of science that can help us explain that and understand it. And if that leads us to changing some of the planning for the city or some of the building requirements, so be it. I would like to see us have a conversation to figure out what's going on here. 
>> Oklahoma city mayor mick cornett, I appreciate your time. 
>> I want to bring into the conversation now someone that's been helpful to us in the last 24 hours in terms of getting the word out about the response in the oklahoma city suburbs and in the state at large. It's the state's lieutenant governor todd lamb touring the disaster site on the ground to see extent of the damage and meet with survivors and local officials. I know he brought along his boots and work gloves in case he needed to pitch in even though he is the lieutenant governor. Thank you very much for your time tonight, sir. It's good to have you with us. 
>> You're welcome, rachel. 
>> We spoke with you last night in the immediate aftermath of the storm when we were trying to get our heads around exactly what the disaster site would be like in terms of scale and seeing it on the ground today in daylight, what can you tell us about how things are looking and how this compares to previous disasters. 
[00:12:05]



>> Rachel, it's horrific. Absolutely horrific. As you and I discussed last night, I was at the emergency operations center. I saw the images on television. I arrived on site here at 5:50 this morning. Once the sun finally rose and i saw daylight absolutely horrific devastation here in moore, oklahoma. To the credit of the rescue workers and first responders overnight I know you reported this many times as has msnbc, 101 survivors found throughout the night, midnight hour, shows the hard work and love of fellow oklahomans trying to find their neighbors and loved ones amidst this rubble and it will continue. I'm the eternal optimist. I have great hope and faith until we know for sure. Until we know beyond a shadow of a doubt that we are not missing anybody whatsoever. Until that time occurs, i believe there's still hope and there's still a chance and there's still opportunity and we have faith that we might find another survivor until every body is accounted for. 
>> Locally right now where you are in moore roadly over the state, are you getting the right amount of help? Not too much that it's crowding out people's ability to do the work and not too little so that you are needing something that you're not getting. Is the help that you're getting from around the country what you need at this point? 
>> That's a very important question and very appropriate question. Too much help can at times be counterproductive. Just yesterday last evening the fire chief here in moore said we have enough volunteers and enough help in that regard. The professional help, the first responders, medical personnel, law enforcement, military, et cetera, et cetera. We've had all of the help that we've needed. Governor fallin yesterday evening when I was with her she talked to the regional manager of fema. She requested federal disaster relief. She visited with the president last night. President obama pledged any support he could give through the federal government to oklahoma. Every request that state of oklahoma has made has been met by the federal government at this point. 
[00:14:09]



>> Let me ask you the question i just asked oklahoma city mayor mick cornett when you think about repeated devastation sadly in this specific part of oklahoma and oklahoma city suburbs having been hit so many different times by tornadoes, obviously tornadoes are just part of prairie life. In these built up areas there's been such devastation over the last generation over the past couple decades. When you think about the prospect of rebuilding in these areas, is there anything that can be done or should be prioritized in terms of increasing the surviveability and the ability to withstand this kind of thing. 
>> That's a very big question that would take a lot of time to answer. I look forward to visiting with congressman tom cole whose district we're in right now. You probably know congressman cole from your experience in d.C. And politics. We're in his district. He took the tour today. We weren't together. I look forward to visiting with him with thoughts or suggestions he has regarding his hometown of moore, oklahoma, and his congressional district. There are various images and talked personal testimony of those that have been struck here in moore. They love their hometown. It's a hometown. Everybody has a hometown. Moore's hotown to a lot of folks. These individuals who have been struck just yesterday even if they were struck before the community was struck before three times in the last 14 years, they want to rebuild here because they love their hometown and I suspect that's what they'll do. 
>> Oklahoma lieutenant governor todd lamb, thank you for joining us tonight. Some day a million years from now we'll get you on the show and we'll fight about some petty thing in politics or something but for now I want to say please stay in touch with us on this over the next few days as the struggle continues in your state and good luck to you, sir. Thank you so much. 
[00:16:10]



>> You're welcome. 
>> Appreciate it. All right. If you think you can imagine what 200-mile-an-hour winds feel like, you cannot. Not unless you have personally been through it. There's nothing like that experience in normal human life that can help you imagine it. But these 200-mile-an-hour storms happen. They recur in specific parts of the country and how survivable they are now and in the future depends in part on people not only imagining winds that strong but replicating winds that strong in a lab environment. That's kind of amazing. HOLD ON.rrying a lot of weight, C-MAX has a nice little trait, You see, C-MAX helps you load your freight, with its foot-activated lift gate.

>>> There are certain dates that resonate across the country as dates. 9/11 for example, everybody knows what you mean if you SAY 9/11 OR SEPTEMBER 11th. For generations just saying december 7th had about the same effect everyone knew what you meant if you just said that date. For the people of newtown, connecticut, it's the same. The date for them which will always mean the same thing now FOREVER IS DECEMBER 14th. That's the kind of context you needed if you want to understand the front page of the oklahoman newspaper today. WORSE THAN MAY 3rd. The monster returned. When you say may 3rd in oklahoma, it's one of those dates everyone knows what you're referring to. MAY 3rd, 1999, WHEN AN OUTBREAK Of tornadoes careened through texas and oklahoma and one of those tornadoes, an f-5 with winds speeds over 300 miles an hour, drove straight through moore, oklahoma, and bridge creek and other oklahoma city suburbs. That one twister that day in 1999 took the lives of three dozen people and injured hundreds of people and now the same place has been hammered again. BUT SINCE MAY 3rd, SINCE THE Storm 14 years ago that changed the meaning of that date in oklahoma forever, since then, something important has changed in that region. It's technological.

>>> If you drive out off suburban moore, oklahoma, where that tornado hit a couple hours to the southeast, you'll reach a country town called tushka, oklahoma. It'sight in the heart of tornado country. An ef-3 tornado, the one you see here in fact, flattened much of tushka, oklahoma. It killed two people. The astounding thing is that almost everybody in tushka survived the storm even though the town survived the whole town. Most of the people in town took shelter in safe rooms designed to protect them. One of the oldest laws of surviving a tornado is to get yourself underground if you possibly can. Get into a basement if you have one or a especially built storm cellar or a safe room designed to withstand incredible winds and debris of a monster storm. Back in 1947 the town of tushka built a public shelter for the town that's below ground next to the high school that's a 45-foot long tunnel with steel doors at each end. A few years ago tushka decided to supplement that adding a second shelter above ground. A concrete reinforced above ground safe room. It cost $150,000 paid for by a grant from fema and put that new above ground shelter right next to the preschool in town. When that big ef-3 tornado came in april 2011, something like two-thirds of the whole town's total population piled into those two shelters. The winds outside reached 165 miles an hour and people of the town stood inside shoulder to shoulder with their dogs and their kids and they waited it out quoting the tulsa world across town two elderly sisters were caught inside their home. They died in the storm's fury. Each and every person who sought refuge in the two public shelters walked out alive that night. Tushka's mayor told the paper at the time the death toll would have been higher if there hadn't been the safe rm to take shelter in. We are thankful we had that. If you want to know what people do with the roughly 15 minutes lead time that the national weather service is usually able to give when a tornado is coming to your town, if you are within 15 minutes of tushka, oklahoma, you use that lead time to drive to tushka to get into one of those town shelters. People in the surrounding area all come to town to get into that community shelter. The tulsa world says statewide oklahoma has 77 of these big safe rooms like tushka's scattered around the state. Community safe rooms. Most funded by fema grants and they are incredibly valuable resources for those communities. That tornado in 2011, the one that nearly everybody survived because of those safe rooms, that tornado wiped out tushka's school entirely so the town had to build a whole new school from the ground up. The superintendent of the school district there told us today the very first question the town asked when they realized they needed to build a new school, first question they ask are where are the safe rooms going to go? Where are the safe rooms going to go for the next time a big storm happens because we are pretty sure it might happen here. For the rebuilt school this time around they settled on three big safe rooms. One for each wing of the school so the students in any part of the building can get to the shelter with one-minute's notice. Each of the rooms can hold 150 people. The three safe rooms double as classrooms so they're n sitting empty all the time. They use them as classrooms when there aren't storms and to fit them safe rooms it cost $150,000 more than if they had been regular classrooms. The expense is covered by a grant by fema. They only cost a little more than to build than a regular classroom. It's not free but it is not that expensive either. If right now listening to this at home you wish there were more of these kinds of things around in tornado county, you're not alone. Victoria county, texas, on the gulf coast got a fema grant for a community safe room and fema has grants for individual families who want to buy a safe room for their homes. Not everyone who wants grant gets one but fema will cover up to about $2,000. Homeowners in moore, oklahoma, have used fema grants to build safe rooms there. It has happened. The city has been trying to participate in that gr program in a bigger way trying to get more fema funding to build more shelters in moore, oklahoma. In recent months and years, they say they have had trouble getting through the application process. In february of this year, officials in moore announced on their website that they were trying tre funding for shelters but fema requirements in their words were a constantly moving target. That was in february that they said that. Then yesterday of course 14 years after the big may 3rd tornado, ten years after the other big one that hit moore in 2003, it happened again. And we cannot know for sure what difference more safe rooms would have made in moore, oklahoma, when that tornado struck. We cannot know. We do know two schools leveled by that twister did not have safe rooms and we do know that teachers and kids describe trying to hide in closets and hallways and hide in bathrooms as that twister approached. They knew to get safe. They just had to make do trying to get safe as best they could in a normal building. We know that at one of the schools all of the children survived. One of the other schools some kids were lost. How many yet we do not know. At a press conference this afternoon, oklahoma officials said they funded over 100 safe rooms for schools around the state just not the schools that got hit yesterday. Oklahoma officials are talking now about maybe looking into requiring safe rooms in more places like for example schools for the good of community and the good of the people of oklahoma. There were people last night in both of the town safe rooms, the shelters that saved them before. People sought shelter there last night just in case. He said he could not help thinking about the folks up the road at the schools in moore. He told us today it was on my mind last night when they were huddled in the hallways. It's a tough situation. Joining us now is larry. A research associate at the national wind institute at texas tech university which tests the ability of these safe rooms to withstand the kind of abuse they are dealt in a tornado. Mr. Tanner, thank you very much for being with us tonight. 
[00:32:15]



>> You're very welcome, rachel. 
>> You are an expert on these things and you work in this field and I do not. Let me first ask you if in terms of explaining safe rooms and how they have functioned in the past and how towns rely on them, is that basically your understanding? 
>> Safe rooms certainly will if they're tested, safe rooms will certainly protect you from these kinds of storms no doubt. 
>> What kind of wind speeds can structures withstand? How do you test them and what kind of failures are you looking for when you put them through these tests? 
>> The fema guidelines require wind pressures for the storm come from a 250-mile-per-hour ground speed tornado and that's speed on the ground and that the typical debris generated by that STORM WOULD BE A WOODEN 2x4 That's 15 pounds and propelled at 100 miles an hour. 
>> So you recreate those conditions in a lab using these commercially available buildings. Do you feel like people who are marketing these 
-- obviously this is a public safety issue, also a business. When you are finding people marketing these, are their products good products when people market these things as safe, are you generally finding that they're right? 
>> Well, anything that's come through our laboratory we list those companies on our website and we're very confident that if they're going to go to the trouble and expense of doing the testing that they're sincere in protecting their customers. Of course there are certain manufacturers out there that do not go through the testing regimen and the reliability of their shelters I have no idea of how reliable they are. 
[00:34:19]



>> What do you think is stopping the country from building more of these safe rooms for homes and schools? Obviously there is expense. They're not the most expensive things in the world particularly if you average them against the cost of recurring disasters like tornadoes in parts of the country we know to be prone to them. Do you think that if we had more safe rooms it would have made a difference in a situation like moore yesterday? 
>> Very definitely. It would have made a difference especially in those schools. You know, we know that there are more safe rooms in the area. I investigated the 23 storm and personally went to all of the 
-- a number of the homes in the previously damaged area of '99 and a lot of those homes had been rebuilt with safe rooms. And that was a result of the first fema grant for residential safe rooms and there's been a lot that have been installed in that area and we're getting ready to go right back out to moore and try to validate the existence of residential shelters and if there were any community shelters in the area. 
>> Larry tanner, research associate at the national wind institute at texas tech university. Thank you for helping us to understand this tonight, sir. Appreciate your time. 
>> You're very welcome. 
>> Our coverage of the tornado mage and rescue efforts in oklahoma is going to continue tonight of course but coming up next, we're going to take a quick look at the other news that's happening elsewhere today including a very big piece of news that just happened this evening in washington. That story is next.E things can become major victories. I'm phil mickelson, pro golfer. When I was diagnosed with psoriatic arthritis, my rheumatologist prescribed enbrel for my pain and stiffness, and to help stop joint damage. 
[ Male Announcer ] ENBREL MAY LOWER YOUR Ability to fight infections. Serious, sometimes fatal events including infections, tuberculosis, lymphoma, other cancers, nervous system and blood disorders, and allergic reactions have occurred. Before starting enbrel, your doctor should test you for tuberculosis and discuss whether you've been to a region where certain fungal infections are common. You should not start enbrel if you have an infection like the flu. Tell your doctor if you're prone to infections, have cuts or sores, have had hepatitis b, haveeen treated for heart failure, or if you have symptoms such as persistent fever, bruising, bleeding, or paleness. Since enbrel helped relieve my joint pain, it's the little things that mean the st. Ask your rheumatologist if enbrel is right for you.

>>> Obviously all eyes today and tonight continue to be on oklahoma city even as the oklahoma city mayor told us that he does not expect anymore survivors to be found in moore, oklahoma, after that tornado yesterday. The rescue and recovery efforts do still continue there. Tonight we'll get back to that coverage in just a moment. We also want to give you an update on what's happening today in washington and in other news outside of the storm. First and foremost, a major development in d.C. Within the last couple of hours on one of the biggest legislative items on president obama's second term agenda. Tonight in the united states senate the judiciary committee passed an overhaul of the country's immigration laws. The law was 13-5 meaning three republicans voted with the democratic majority to move the immigration bill forward. The important thing is what happens next here is the republican senate leader, mitch McCONNELL, SAID EARLIER TODAY That the republicans are not going to block this bill from coming to the senate floor for a full vote. Bottom line it means it appears unusually likely that something major that comprehensive immigration reform might pass the united states senate even without having to overcome a filibuster. That is a very big deal. Just have to stay tuned on that one. Also today, there was a major federal court ruling related to the killing of osama bin laden. Since the raid on bin laden's compound in pakistan in 2011, there have been a lot of efforts by advocacy groups to get the government to turn over photographers taken of bin laden's corpse after his death. More than 50 images of dead bin laden were taken the night he was killed and those images have been classified as top secret by the u.S. Government. The government has refused to release those images publicly saying they provide no information of public utility but they are potent enough to endanger american lives particularly abroad if they were released. Today a federal appeals court in washington ruled in the government's favor. They ruled the government is not trying to hide something by keeping these photos secret but the release of the photos could lead to "the killing of americans and violence against american interests" and so the photos do not need to be released. The conservative group that lost this case today does have the option to appeal this ruling to the supreme court but we do not yet know if they will. Also today, it was a really bizarre incident inside one of the world's most recognizable landmarks. This is e cathedral of notre dame in paris, france. Today that historic cathedral, that 900-year-old cathedral was the scene of a dramatic politically motivated suicide. A 78 year old far right nationalist writer in france who is known for his anti-gay marriage views, he walked into the cathedral, pulled out a gun and killed himself right in front of the alter in front of hundreds of tourists. In his final essay, posted on his website earlier in the day, the man criticized france's adoption of what he called a vile law legalizing gay marriage and gay adoption. The president of france signed that law into bill on saturday. Same-sex marriages are set to begin in france later this month. Back here in the u.S., There was a big vote with international implications in the u.S. Senate today. In addition to the immigration bill, the senate foreign relations committee voted on legislation calling for the u.S. To arm the rebels in syria. To arm the groups fighting against the assad regime in that civil war for the past two years. It was a 15-3 vote. 15-3. Very lopsided vote. Only votes against were against rand paul and two democratic senators. The vote is not definitive in terms of what the u.S. Will do but puts pressure on john kerry who arrived in the middle east today for a week-long trip aimed at building support to a peaceful end to the war in syria. Secretary kerry's former colleagues in the senate not making his job any eier today. 
[00:43:09]



>>> There was also big news out of the great state of arizona. A federal court in arizona struck down that state's ban on abortions after 20 weeks. The law that the court struck down today was signed by arizona's governor jan brewer last april making abortion illegal in the state even before the fetus has traditionally been thought to be viable. But today the ninth circuit court of appeals said what everybody knows to be true that ban is unconstitutional under the terms set out under roe versus wade. A lot of states have this style of ban enacting this style ban in the last few years. Arizona did take a slightly different approach to it in terms of its technical terminology for how it defines when the ban takes effect. It's unclear how widely this ruling will apply but conceivably this ruling today from the ninth circuit could strike down a similar ban in idaho because that state falls under the jurisdiction of the ninth circuit like arizona does. We'll have to wait and see what happens in idaho and the rest o the circuit. Proponents of this ban in arizona are suggesting that they may appeal today's ruling all of the way up to the supreme court. 
>>> In the state of arkansas today, the state's treasurer who is a democrat faced increasing pressure to step down from her job after she was arrested by the fbi. She is charged with conspireing to extort money as a public official and transferring state business in exchange for that money. This case with the arkansas state treasurer involves a bond broker and involves rolls of hundred dollar bills that were allegedly delivered in pie boxes. That also had pies in them. Everybody in arkansas politics in both parties up to and including the democratic governor have called on the treasure heer to resign. Tonight she has resigned. Her resignation took effect at 5:00 p.M. This evening local time. If convicted, she faces the possibility of 20 years behind bars. 
>>> In the state of virginia today, the state republican party is now officially in possession of its slate of candidates who will run in virginia's statewide elections this fall. Those candidates were chosen at a party convention over the weekend. Not a primary but a convention. They include the republican party's candidates for governor and lieutenant governor and attorney general. This was not a primary. This was a party convention that picked candidates. There was no statewide voting here just the republican loyalists who showed up. And those republican loyalists who showed up for the convention picked candidates for the statewide election who are very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very conservative. Barring further breaking news developments, tomorrow we'll have more on that important political story on tomorrow night's show but suffice to say I didn't use enough verys in describing them. 
[00:46:00]



>>> Protests at the justice department headquarters in washington d.C. These protests began yesterday when activists blocked traffic in front of the justice department around 2:00 in the afternoon. The protesters managed to shut down constitutionalvenue in d.C. For hours yesterday before a total of 17 of them were arrested. These activists are protesting the fact that the justice department has not taken enough action in their view against big banks that legally foreclosed on people in the wake of the financial crisis. Tents were pitched last night and then early this morning police attempted to dislodge them from their location and there were a number of additional arrests today including at least one activist who appears on this tape to have btasered by police on scene. This apparent tasering and multiple arrests and blocking constitutional avenue for hours is a major protest site in washington. 
>>> Finally, the other big story to watch in washington today was anticipation that continues to build for a major address that president obama has scheduled to deliver on thursday. It's going to be a major address from the president on the subject of civil liberties. The president is expected to address the drone program of targeting killings abroad and his efforts to close the prison that we maintain in cuba guantanamo. The first time the president has spoken at length on those issues in a very long time. The news outlet reuters is porting the obama administration may be planning to announce that they're moving a significant portion of the drone program out of the hands of the cia and into t remitt of the military and that may sound like we're going to be droning people in far away countries but it would be a big deal in terms of the accountability of that program here at home. How much we as americans are allowed to know about that particular way we have been waging war in an ongoing way. We do not know yet if the president is going to discuss that exact policy change in his speech on thursday. I'm guessing he will. We'll learn more when the speech happens and tomorrow night on the show we'll have the pentagon's former general counsel during president obama's first term, jay johnson, will be our guest tomorrow to discuss that big news and talk about the president's big speech on these matters might mean. 
[00:48:16]



>>> Right now these stories all of the other stories in the country are understandably all on the back burner in favor of continued focus on what's still under way right now in oklahoma and continuing response at this hour and to just the unimaginably large tornado that hit oklahoma city yesterday afternoon. We're going to have the latest from the rescue efforts coming up right after this.Every food is finger food. So I can't afford to have germy surfaces.

>>> We will have more from oklahoma ahead. Before we do that, one other story worth keeping an eye on now that is the on-going still unfolding drama surrounding the irs. These are tea party protesters today at the irs office in philadelphia. Tea party group said they would protest at irs offices all over the country today, but local coverage of whether or not the protests actually happened does seem to be sparce. Tea party protesters showed up specifically at the irs office in cincinnati, the office where key words like tea party and patriot were used to single out groups for special scrutiny when they applied for tax exempt status. Conservative tea party movement was in the midst of fading to black when the irs apologized for its actions and thrust this issue into the headlines a little over a week ago. Tea partiers now hope the scandal women reenergize and reinvigorate their movement. Otherwise absorbed into the churn of republican party politics. Tea partiers hope with the irs as a convenient adversary, they could be back. The first hearings on the irs scandal were held last week, there were more today, more tomorrow. Alongside many over congressional committees that are investigating the same scandal but have not yet gotten around to holding their own hearings. All of that alongside an fbi criminal investigation into whether anyone broke the law in this scandal, and it is in that context we got the news today that the head of the part of the irs where it all happens is going to take the fifth tomorrow. In her job since the bush administration, she clumsily apologized for her behavior. She has been subpoenaed to testify to congress tomorrow. Today her lawyer said rather than testify under oath she will plead the fifth. She will invoke her right against self-incrimination. The committee will make her show up in person to plead the fifth rather than excuse her from testifying, which is what her lawyer asked for on the grounds he could promise she really was not going to say anything. The committee is not excusing her, they'll make her show up and say repeatedly she will not answer their questions. The other side of the story, the increasingly in coherent upset over the timing of when the irs problem became widely known. Was it not just a bad thing the irs was doing but also a coverup of the bad thing the irs was doing? Reporters at the white house press briefing pressed jay carney on the alleged secrecy of the investigation. Why was it kept secret so long? Why did nobody know about this investigation? For the record, I want to point out this. This was posted online publicly in october. It is the official public unclassified free to everyone publication that the irs investigation was under way. It was posted publicly online in october and yes, there was a lot about the scandal that is scandalous. A lot scandalous about the irs story, it will look particularly scandalous when the irs official shows up and pleads the fifth tomorrow. The idea that the investigation of the irs problem was somehow kept secr that it was covered up and that's also a scandal, that is not true. Here it is. Publicly disclosed last year on the internet machine for everybody. You can look it up. Novel idea, I know. anything. I had pain in my abdomen... it just wouldn't go away. I was spotting, but I had already gone through menopause. These symptoms may be nothing... but they could be early warning signs of a gynecologic cancer, such as cervical, ovarian, or uterine cancer.

>>> In the suburbs of oklahoma city, they're still assessing damage of yesterday's rare ef-5 category tornado, after declaring a state of emergency in oklahoma, the president pledged federal help to victims of the storm, quote, right away. Homeland security security janet napolitano will be visiting oklahoma tomorrow, but on her way there, she's going to stop in joplin, missouri to speak at a ceremony marking the anniversary of another massive tornado that ravaged joplin two years ago, took the lives of 161 people. Secretary napolitano will fly from joplin to moore, oklahoma where she's planning on meeting with local officials there and inspecting the damage.

So, Wayne, how'd you learn all those cool self-defense moves? I had training. Special training. The kind they're not allowed to give anymore.

(straining) (sighs) (door opens, closes) Hey, Simpson, you want to hear about the big change in my life? Sure, why not. I started drinking orange juice with pulp. I asked the Reverend, and he said it was okay. Then he hung right up on me. That man is cranky at

(bleep) A quiet, unassuming sety guard who foiled a robbery at a local tavern, as seen in this Taiwanese animated dramatization. (female narrator speaking Taiwanese) (laughing) (tires screeching) (video game sound effects) Please, sir, just let me do my job. Pish tush. Wayne, as a reward for your valiant fisticuffery, I hereby award you the Springfield Nuclear Plant Silver Safety Hat. (fanfare plays) (fanfare plays, horses neigh) (chuckles maniacally) Thanks to you, Wayne, we did not lose the visible half of the moon. Just doing my job, sir. All too well. I'm afraid that protocol demands that I totally erase your memory. (grunting) (crackling) (grunting) Die, you fascist bastard! Mother, is that you? Wayne, stop! That's Mr. Burns! (gasping) Ooh. I expect insolence, but rank insolence? Off with his job! (sighs) Damn it. Why don't you come stay with us till you can get back on your feet? Really? Are you sure? Of course. I mean, how long could it be? I don't know. I've got no job, no references, can't afford my apartment. It's best to concentrate on what you do have. I have reoccurring flashbacks 

[00:13:03]


to a nightmarish past. That's funny, because I have reoccurring flash-forwards to a nightmarish future. (chanting): Unfair! Unfair! That robot took our jobs! He said it. Or, uh, maybe it was him. Man, this robot really gets me. My nightmares are real. Your voice is so gravelly, just like Lauren Bacall's. If you don't listen to me, Senator, there's not going to be a Fourth of July! WAYNE (panting): Don't you get it? He used the governor's eyeball for the retinal scan! That's ten members of the electoral college dead in one day! If you don't give me those launch codes, you'll never be able to make the "okay" sign again. I know the map is inside your eyelids, and I will turn them inside out if I have to! If you move that little top hat to St. James Place, we'll all be blown to kingdom come! Bring me every fish in that aquarium! One of them is lying! (relieved sigh) I'm sorry I have so many nightmares. I've done unspeakable things, from Buenos Aires to the Ukraine. Well, what brought you to Springfield? Was it our Frito-Lay distribution center? I needed somewhere to lie low. Your town appears on no maps or charts. Yeah, they couldn't find a Google map photo without me naked or urinating. And when there was a mapmaker's convention here, they all got Lou Gehrig's disease. Not the one you're thinking of-- there's another one. So, Lisa, if you press on Bart's elbow, here, Ow! he'll tell you anything you want to know. I admit it! I let Milhouse lie down in your bed! Kids, can I talk to Wayne alone a minute? Remember everything they say, and tell us later in rattle code. (rattling) What do you mean, no? (grunts) I don't know if you should teach our children advanced interrogation techniques. I'm sorry, Marge. Sometimes I forget where I am. Apology accepted. Now, could you teach me a couple little driving tricks? 

[00:15:11]


(laughs) We'll see who gets their pick of pizza pockets! Give us your lunch money! (grunting in pain) (martial arts yell) (bones crack, grunts) What gives, man? Where'd you learn that stuff? If I told you, I'd have to kill you. Can I tell you? No! I won't listen! We can't keep serving the same thing every day. These kids have mashed potatoes coming out of their ears. (Jimbo yells) Point taken. (playing "Dance of the Knights" by Prokofiev) Oh, my God. That song. (loud whooshing) (playing "Dance of the Knights") (people screaming) (music continues) I can't live in the real world anymore. This is the realworld? Hallelujah! I'm still alive! Ha-ha! And I'll appreciate every moment! Except the ones that aren't as good as they used to be. Which is all of them. Oh, someone kill me. ("Dance of the Knights" playing) Ah, junk, junk.

=======================================================

Thing tha got me was when things started hitting the house hard enough to shake the house. We were in the bath tub and felt the house shake. 
>> I have no doubt that god 
-- they lifted a wall off these kids, several kids. 
>> Was it scary? What was it like? 
>> It was like a big tornado teared up the whole place. 
>> You're a tough one for sticking it out. 
>> Yep. 
>> I'm jake tapper. That's all for me here in moore, oklahoma. Here is my colleague wolf blitzer in "the situation room." 
>> Thanks very much. We're live also here in moore, oklahoma. This is a town absutely devastated by a monstrous tornado. I've been to war zones. This looks like a war zone. Behind me what used to be a bowling alley we're right next door to the moore medical center. You can see bowling balls still behind me at what used to be moore bowling. Here are the latest developments we're following right now. Oklahoma officials today lowered the death toll after initial confusion. At least 24 people including nine children were killed by the massive tornado. At least 237 people were injured. Seven of those children died at the plaza towers elementary school not far away from where we are right now. Some of them drowned while taking shelter in the basement. According to the national weather service, damage assessments show the tornado was an extraordinary ef-5, the highest level with wind speeds 200 miles an hour for at least part of the time it was ravaging the area. Cnn's special coverage of the rescue effort continues right now. You're in "the situation room." 
>>> The path of destruction is said to be 17 miles long and more than a mile wide. Brian todd is here in moore, oklahoma with us. He got a first-hand look at what was going on. I got to tell you, brian, from watching it on television, we expected a bad situation. But once you see this in person, you see what the tornado did and you can only imagine the people who suffered, it's so heart breaking. 
[00:02:16]



>> Can't imagine. This used to be a bowling alley. If anyone was inside it is hard to imagine they got out when you see just what this tornado did here, the destruction, wolf. The mayor of moore was totally exhausted when he led us earlier today into the hardest hit area which is right near us from this area of the bowling alley, what used to be that, to the medical center here. This whole section of town completely torn apart by the tornado. We got a first-hand look at it. We drove past blocks and blocks of shredded homes, mangled cars, and fallen power lines. This is just one of the devastated neighborhoods in moore, oklahoma. The mayor, glen lewis, showed us some of the hardest hit areas. He is trying to get a handle on the scope of the destruction in the town he has lived in all his life. 
>> How overwhelmed do you feel right now with all of this? 
>> Pretty overwhelmed. It's going to be a mess to clean this up. We'll do it. 
>> Reporter: Mayor lewis took us to the ruins of the moore medical center where a pregnant woman went into labor when the storm hit. A local councilman told us what happened next. 
>> The doctor and nurse stayed with her and she completed the birthing process. 
>> While this was going on. 
>> Mm-hmm. 
>> Wow. 
>> And then did they successfully get her and her child out of there? Yeah, yeah. As a matter of fact, they said there was absolutely no injuries to any of the patients or the staff. 
>> Rescue and recovery teams have completed a sweep of the medical center and the parking lot that looks like a junk yard now. CITY OFFICIALS SAY THE Xs ON Vehicles and other things mark the fact that there are no live bodies inside the structure but the mayor says that doesn't mean there aren't any bodies underneath and the mayor says that's why they have the k-9 teams out still combing the wreck for bodies. There are some places in moore that are still too dangerous for us to get close to. Officials are urging residents to stay away from their homes for now so emergency workers can do their jobs and make sure no one else gets hurt. 
>> The biggest concern now for the citizens and then for my men and all the people that have come in to help just to be sure they're safe and be sure the citizens understand that we're doing the best we can and getting there as fast as we can --. 
[00:04:28]



>> The fire chief says first responders are still working around the clock. This is still a rescue effort. He says 
-- the chief says they've gotten through most of the homes here in moore and they're going to go through all of the damaged homes at least three times each. They have to make sure they've gotten everyone out of there. 
>> They're actually telling some people in some of these devastated areas not to go back to their homes. What's going on? The police chief jerry stillings told me that earlier today. He said it is just too dangerous for people to come back and start picking through the wreckage of their homes right now. Downed power lines, open gas lines, very dangerous. He says everyone just stay away but as we've seen in these neighborhoods it doesn't keep people away. They're still coming back and the police chief says that is a real risk. 
>> But you can't blame him. You want to see if they can salvage a photo album, get something out of the rubble that has developed. 
>> Any remnant of their lives. 
>> Yeah. Thanks, brian, very much. John king is also following what's going on. There is a desperate effort under way right now to find survivors if in fact there are more survivors. John is joining us live. Tell our viewers first of all where you are and what you're seeing. 
>> Wolf, I'm not too far away. A little less than a mile from you in moore. As you look through the neighborhood you can see it is devastated. There are hundreds and hundreds of these. You just heard brian say they're asking some families now to come back early. You see one group here. They just came back a short time ago. Taking some stuff from the house. Lining some children's stuff up here and other belongings along the driveway. We've seen this throughout the day. I was here at daybreak and we saw families coming back trying to find precious memorabilia. Some trying to find whether their pets survived. You see again throughout the neighborhood, I just want to walk over to show you the random nature of this monster that came through. This is a child's play area that somehow wrapped up in the tree here as this house. As we're standing here now not that long ago teams of responders did come through here. A big wave of them, search teams with their dogs coming back through. Now all of these houses were searched yesterday afternoon and throughout the late night and into the early morning hours. But I want you to listen here. Brian todd just made note of this. The police chief gary byrd said once is not enough and he hopes by tonight to revisit all of these homes not twice but three times. Let's listen. 
[00:06:47]



>> We made it through I will say most of the structures, most of the vehicles, most of the homes. But the ones we didn't make it through yesterday we'll make it through today for sure and a second and third time. We will be through every damaged piece of property in this city at least three times before we're done. We hope to be done by dark tonight. 
>> Earlier today, wolf, as you well know that was all complicated by the fact it was cold. We had thunderstorms, lightning. The weather has improved dramatically. We saw dozens come through here with their dogs. The dogs, brave dogs going into these homes and buildings, some stepping on the nails and other dangers. Debris here. The search team is coming through. They're finished with this neighborhood and have moved on. I was out with another search team until about 2:00 this morning. They had the dogs as well. At this point they still call it a search and rescue mission but they also say of course the priority would also be recovery and, remarkably, the city manager was in this neighborhood not long o. He says he doesn't believe there is anybody still unaccounted for here in moore. He says that is their unofficial sense. Not anybody unaccounted for. They want to double check and triple check and are urging people if you haven't found anybody, if you have found 
-- if you left the area check in so people know you're accounted for and if you're still missing someone check in but just look around here, wolf. You can see one of the reasons these search teams are coming through and digging through some of this debris is maybe for a miracle if there is somebody buried under this but also just to have a double check and triple check so they're confident they looked everywhere before they declared the search over. 
>> That search is going to continue for sometime. Because it is just an ememorialous area. This is a major suburban part of oklahoma city. It's a community of about 50,000, 60,000 itself, moore, oklahoma, oklahoma city has more than 600,000 people. This tornado and ef-5, the highest category, zipped through this area 24 hours ago with awesome devastation. We'll get back to you. The frantic, terrifying search for survivors in the moments just after the tornado hit have left so many people here in moore, oklahoma understandably shaken and very emotional. One couple spoke about that experience with cnn's george howell. 
[00:09:05]



>> There was just carnage, you know, but it had to be done. People needed to be helped. So I started revving everybody up. People were running up and down the streets and I got them hollering out if you can hear me, call out. And we started finding people. We started getting people out. 
>> Up next, two schools in the path of the storm. One is completely, completely destroyed. Frantic parents desperately searching for young victims. The other school, well, you'll see some efforts under way. The raw emotions as families reunite. 
[00:13:09]



>>> Welcome back to our continuing live coverage here reporting from moore, oklahoma. That's just outside oklahoma city. One of the most horrific scenes here in moore the twisted wreckage of the plaza towers elementary school. Normally 500 kids are students there pre-k through 6th grade. CNN'S erin McPike is on the scene and joining us on the phone. I know authorities are keeping people at a distance. What are you seeing and what can you tell us? 
>> Reporter: I can't get very close to the school but I see it in the distance and a big crane over the top of the school is material around. There are also industrial lights. Even though it is very light outside, sunny, there are lots of crews that need to still comb through the debris. Law enforcement has been very serious about keeping people out and tried to get us out of the way twice. Part of that is because there are gas leaks all through the neighborhood and it's not safe for people as they try and come through the neighborhoods to recover things from their houses. I did talk to a couple teenagers who said they went to the elementary school and they wanted to get up and get a good look at it. Law enforcement is letting no one near that school. 
>> And so you basically 
-- they're not gefg you any updates on if they're still searching, what is going on behind the scenes. They are keeping it pretty closed off. 
>> That's right. They are still looking for things. They haven't been very clear about what that means but there is a very large team searching that area right now, still, wolf. 
>> What a heart breaking story that is over there at that elementary school. In fact, erin, two schools in the path of destruction. This was the wrenching scene at one of them. Briarwood elementary school, just moments after the tornado hit. Frantic parents desperately tried to find their children. 
[00:15:09]



>> Give me a ticket. 
>> Oh, he was so brave. 
>> The heart breaking scene. Let's bring in cnn's ed l levendara. Miraculously everyone survived there. Tell us what you saw. Normally at that elementary school, pre-k through sixth grade, 600 kids would normally be in school. 
>> Reporter: Well, the sounds from the videotape you just played there, wolf, is really chilling but it is a far different scene today. Eerily quiet actually as we walked a mile to get to that school today and met one of the teachers there. Tammy glasgow, a second grade teacher who has taught at briarwood elementary for 16 years and she told me as we talked just outside of her classroom that has been destroyed and demolished and left in pieces that as she saw the tornado coming toward her classroom she simply felt numb. 
>> Before I shut the doors because the bathrooms had doors I said I'm shutting these doors and I love you and the boys looked at me a little strange. Walked in the girls and said, i love you. They all said, I love you back. And you just don't, you know, i told them to pray and that's what we did the whole time in the closet. Just prayed. My own son was in the bathroom with the boys so I just said, watch over them. Take care of them. You know. And it was so loud you can't 
-- you couldn't hear anything. Just hear and it was forever and ever. I would just as soon they would be quick but it just stayed and stayed and stuff was falling on us. We had books over our heads. I looked, glanced up once and you could just see it. It was just like brown, huge, never ending. All the way up to the heavens. And then I got back down a cinder block fell on the back of my neck. So I crouched back down and happened to look up again and you could see that it was, the sky was clearing. There was just stuff flying everywhere. So I said, not yet. Not yet. We got back down and finally the rain started and we could tell it was getting lighter. We started hearing voices and pulling them out. 
[00:18:05]



>> How were the kids reacting? They were surprisingly very calm. 
>> Why do you think that is? 
>> I think they felt safe. We did our best to take care of them and make them feel loved and secure. That 
-- people, you know, talked about us being brave but it's just our job. We love these kids like they're our own. 
>> She also told me an incredible story abouthe moments before the tornado hit that the students were singing the national anthem, that they were preparing and had been practicing for a performance they were to put on at the school later this week and to try to calm themselves down a lot of the kids started singing the national anthem. In the frantic moments after the tornado struck she didn't get a chance to speak very much with her students or the parents that came by to pick them up so she says that there's only three days of school left and she is aches to see the students to make sure they're doing okay. As you might imagine the second grade class will remember miss glasgow no question for the rest of their lives. 
>> They certainly will and they should. What a great emotional story for that. Thanks very much. We'll check back with you. Coming up here our special situation room continues. She says it was the second prayer god answered not just saving her life but her dog's. We'll see the emotional moment he was pulled from the rubble alive. 
>>> Plus a really moving story. A mother and baby flee their home just minutes before it's totally destroyed by this tornado. Because of that split-second decision they are alive and well and here with me right now. I'll spikeeak with them when we come back. nom. ??? The one and only, Cheerios ??? 60's...

-- you can see 
-- skip, come on up and take a look at what is going on. These are bowling balls. You see on this. There is carpeting here. This used to be a bowling alley here in moore. I would walk up there but authorities don't really want us to go into this area. They say it's dangerous to walk around. They don't know what is going on. If you take a lk you can see what used to be these benches wh where 
-- they would keep score. Very popular bowling center here in moore, oklahoma. The entire structure has come down and it's just heart breaking. Ij you take a look over here you see how far it goes. A major complex though the walls have stayed put. This was a very popular bowling alley. Take a look over here skip to my right. If you go over there you see tv crews but you see the medical center is the moore medical center over there. This is 
-- this was a hospital. I guess some day it might still be a hospital. About 40 or 50 beds. Not a big hospital but a hospital that you can really see the destruction especially if you pan over here and you get over there you see what is going on and you see some of the cars literally that had been tossed around into that structure over there. Moore medical center, which was wrecked totally destroyed, miraculously I spoke to dr. Sanjay gupta who spoke with some of the doctors. He is going to be joining us pretty soon. He points out that no one in that hospital was injured. They got everybody out okay. They evacuated people to some of the safer areas, some of the shelter areas. They did an amazing job. Sanjay is going to share that story with us later here in the situation room. This is just one of the amazing stories that we're seeing. A hospital destroyed. A bowling alley destroyed. An entertainment complex still there but it's pretty much destroyed as well. Amid all of this destruction, one amazing story of survival comes through. I want you to watch this. 
[00:25:48]



>> I was holding my dog. I was sitting on the stool holding my dog. This was the game plan all through the years to go in that little bathroom. And the electric never went off. The electric went off in the bathroom about the same time i felt the stool come up out of the floor. And I rolled around a little bit and when it stopped I was right there. That stove cooker is what I saw. 
>> You were lying in the rubble. 
>> And I never lost consciousness. I hollered for my little dog. He didn't answer or didn't come so I know he is in here somewhere. 
>> The dog. Hi, puppy! 
>> Oh, bless your little bitty heart. Help me. Oh 
-- oh! 
>> Come on. 
>> Can you get him? 
>> Oh, oh. Well, I thought god just answered one prayer to let me be okay. He answered both of them because this was my second prayer. 
>> What a story that is. There are thousands and thousands of these stories. I just was walking around for the past few hours trying to absorb what is going on. Virtually every person I saw here in moore, oklahoma had a story to share, a powerful story. What happened 24 hours ago here is so, so destructive, so powerful, but there were miracles. Indeed, a mother's split-second decision to take her baby and leave their home only moments before the tornado destroyed that home. That mother and the baby, they are here with me. We'll talk to them. Right after this. ??? ??? ???

>>> As urgent rescue efforts continue in the wake of oklahoma's killer tornado, here are the latest developments we're watching right now. The death toll is now at least 24 including nine children. It was revised lower today after some early confusion. At least 237 people were injured. The storm more than a mile wide carved a path of destruction 17 miles long through the oklahoma city suburbs including in moore where I am reporting from right now. Throughout the disaster zone at least a hundred people have been pulled alive from the rubble. Officials say the search goes on board by board until every vehicle, every ruined structure is examined they say not once not twice but three times. They don't want to make any mistakes. Rebecca was prepared to ride out the tornado with her 19-month-old son anders. Rebecca is here. There is anders. How do you feel right now? Say good. 
>> Anders, can you say good? No. Okay. He is a little shy right now. He has the microphone. Rebecca, tell us what happened. You were at home. Your husband was away on the road, right? 
>> He was on the interstate. 
>> You were in your house. 
>> Yeah. 
>> You're not from this area. I'm from louisiana. 
>> What did he sayo you if there were a tornado? 
>> He and all the other oklahomans say stay in your home and they always say it never hits anybody. I've lived here my entire life. Never hits. You know, you don't leave. There's been times where with him I was in the bath tub with a helmet on my head crying and begging to leave and he'd say no we're not going anywhere and it didn't hit us and maybe you're right. But I never felt that way. 
>> So yesterday around 2:00 or 3:00 in the afternoon you're home alone. 
>> Yeah. 
>> And you got anders and you and what do you do? 
>> I've been watching the news all day and it kept saying oh, it's going to come at 6:00 or and then it even pushed it back to 8:00 and so when I saw clouds outside I was like, okay. Why are there clouds? Then I looked and they started saying all the buzz words that I'm used to hearing here. The hook, it's strengthening, feeding, you know. And then they showed 
-- i immediately went and I got my tub that had some water and put a towel down and grabbed his mattress and brought it into the bathroom with us and put the lap top there for us to watch what was going on and then they showed it and they said it was 44 and then showed the projection and it was like crossing my street. And whenever I saw it I just panicked. I just panicked. I looked at it and I said, I'm not staying. 
[00:34:20]



>> You were lying in the bath tub with anders. 
>> Yeah. 
>> All of a sudden you have the lap top. 
>> It was five miles away. They said it's strengthening. 
>> Your husband is away. 
>> I see debris in the air from this thing coming right for me and I'm from louisiana. We have hurricanes. And when they're big you just leave. You know? It was sort of like suddenly telling me, you know, there's a hurricane that's going to hit your house in ten minutes. You know? 
>> What did you do? 
>> I ran. I ran. I didn't have any shoes on. I didn't grab anything. I was mad that I had to get keys. I couldn't believe I had to get my keys. 
>> For the car. 
>> Yeah. It was so frustrating to have to get keys. I just wanted to leave. I didn't even put him in his car seat. I just put him in my lap and i kept thinking they're never going to pull me over. You know, why would they do that? 
>> You just started driving. 
>> I just drove. I drove. But I started feeling guilty he was on my lap like this is a bad decision so I got him out just past the high school when i pulled over and I went to put him in his car seat but the winds were so hard it was like blowing him side ways. 
>> It was like torrential out there. Raining. 
>> This was, yeah, at least a half a mile away from my house and it was windy like that. I just shoved him in his car seat and clicked the top and went another mile and went and fixed his car seat. 
>> You saw the tornado? 
>> Yeah. 
>> How far was the tornado from where you were? 
>> About two miles. 
>> So you were just trying to drive in the opposite direction? 
>> Yeah. Well, I drove south because it was going northeast. 
>> You just drove as fast as you could. 
>> Yeah. I just sat there and then i said, I realized my cats were at the house. You know. And I was like oh, my gosh. I have to go back. I got to see if they're okay. 
>> How long did you sit before you made that u-turn and went back? 
>> Not 
-- 15 minutes. 
[00:36:21]



>> Your husbandasway. 
>> He was closer. 
>> Did you have a cell phone? 
>> No. We don't own cell phones because we're, we've decided not to catch up with the modern age. 
>> All right. So your husband is 
-- he thinks you're at home. 
>> He thinks I'm there. 
>> Inside the house in the bathroom. 
>> Yeah. He actually 
-- you know, I knew we were safe so I stayed in the traffic to get back because everybody was trying to go back. And then I didn't have shoes but I found some heels in my back seat and I threw those on so i had to kind of tiptoe all the way back. It took me forever. Maybe 45 minutes. 
>> You get back to your house and what do you see? 
>> He is just searching for us, my husband. He is there. The house is what? Nothing. This. 
>> The house looks like this. 
>> Just like this. There's less standing. Like those chairs are standing. We don't have anything. 
>> Your husband thinks you and anders are inside. 
>> Well he found the towel. 
>> We'll show our viewers a picture of the house. He found ael on the back of the bathroom a he found the mattress next to it so he knew that's what I do. That's the thing we do. Then the helmet he remembered that I put on a helmet last time so he found anders' helmet and he was, you know, didn't know what to think. 
>> He thought you were inside. 
>> He watched it hit. 
>> He thought you were dead. 
>> Yeah. 
>> He thought anders was dead. 
>> Yeah. 
>> And you were underneath that rubble. Yeah. I mean, the car, you know, was gone but our neighbor's car was on our house. There was no reason to think that my car couldn't have just been somewhere. 
>> It's like the cars were flying around as if they were nothing during this 200-mile-per-hour tornado when you think about what's going on. All right. So there's obviously he sees you at one point. He's home. 
>> I screamed. I just screamed at the top of my lungs. 
>> Describe that. 
>> You know, as soon as I 
-- i didn't know he would be there. There was no reason for me to have thought he would be there especially before me. I just went down the road and came back but he had ran from his car to try to get there and one of our 
-- I just went, brian! Brian! You know, and he just ran up and we both cried and hugged and it was actually like 
-- when we hug, we all three hug anders always says, ah. We just burst into tears. It was awesome. 
[00:38:41]



>> Anders, he talks a lot but he is pretty shy right now. 
>> He's preoccupied. He needs something to 
-- 
>> he's a happy little guy. 
>> Yeah. 
>> You're a happy young lady. 
>> I couldn't be happier. 
>> You survived. 
>> I saw the bath tub. 
>> When you think about it if you would have stayed in that house. 
>> No. There is no way. Our bath tub was full of debris. The place I would have been just FULL OF 2 X 4s AND EVERYTHING Else. You know. There is nothing, no way. That's hard to think about. 
>> Anders, I'll train you now to become an anchorman. He doesn't want to l go. 
>> Try and pry it from him. 
>> Hold it like this. Put it in front of your mouth. Look at the camera over there. 
>> Can you say hi? 
>> Say I'm anders and this is cnn. Can you say that? 
>> How old are you? He's not going to say anything. Can you say bye-bye? Bye-bye. No. 
>> He is a shy little guy. 
>> Not today. 
>> Bye-bye. 
>> He said it. Okay. Good. Bye-bye. Shake hands. 
>> Shake his hand. Can he high five? No. 
>> No? Okay. 
>> Yeah. 
>> Thank you. Yeah. Such a sweet little guy. 
>> Yeah. 
>> All right. You're blessed. Brian, your husband is blessed. Anders is blessed. 
>> Brian. You like brian. That's your dad. 
>> We're happy you're here. You guys did a great job. I guess you got to thank the lord. Right? 
>> Yeah. 
>> Do you thank the lord for that split-second decision? 
>> I 
-- I'm actually an atheist. 
>> You are. All right. 
>> But you made the right call. 
>> Yeah. We are here and you know I don't blame anybody for thanking the lord. 
>> Of course not. 
>> No. 
>> Okay. All right. Anders, want to try one more time? Good for you. 
>> Oh, no. Bowling balls. All right. He is 18 months old and he'll have a happy, happy life. 
[00:40:42]



>> Yeah. 
>> All right. Rebecca, thank you. Thanks to brian, too. 
>> I will. 
>> Nice story. Happy ending. Excellent story. We have more stories though. Not all of them as happy as rebecca's story. Ahead, we'll hear from the family of two children. They say a daycare operator also nothing less than a hero after what they went through. We'll share the details right after this. ???

>>> We have an emotional story involving a 3-year-old. He was in the daycare center and you're going to hear really another heart wrenching, miraculous story of survival there. There are so many of them here in moore, oklahoma where we're reporting from today and will be reporting from tomorrow as well. Members of congress back in washington. Those members of congressrom oklahoma have left the nation's capital together to survey the damage back home here in oklahoma. Our chief congressional correspondent dana bash caught up with them exclusively as they were leaving the capital together. She asked republican senator james inoff about the federal relief effort and getting oklahoma constituents the federal dollars they desperately will need right now to recover. 
[00:45:25]



>> I was there in 1999 the same exact place, the same tornado. The same track. And I was very glad afterwards that we were. We get to communicate with the people on the ground, the ones who are devastated, and that's just what we're supposed to be doing. 
>> Reporter: What should the federal response be when it comes to money? Well, we do have both individual and public assistance already approved. T obviously we qualify for everything, any type of emergency funding rncht i understand it is too early to know what additional you will need if anything in oklahoma but if there is additional federal funding needed will you demand it be offset by other cuts? 
>> No. In fact it wouldn't be because it's already appropriated. 
>> Reporter: But if you need additional appropriations. 
>> We wouldn't need an additional appropriations bill. Everything is in place right now. 
>> Dana bash speaking exclusively with the oklahoma lawmaker. Much more coming up. We're reporting now from moore, oklahoma. Two boys were in a daycare center when this tornado hit 24 hours or so ago. Their families spent three anguished hours not knowing if they were safe. You'll hear this amazing story when we come back. people question: How old is the oldest person you've known? We gave people a sticker and had them show us. We learned a lot of us have known someone who's lived well into their 90s. And that's a great thing. But even though we're living longer, one thing that hasn't changed much is the official retirement age. ??? ??? the question is how do you make sure you have the money you need to enjoy all of these years. ??? ??? me, insurance.

>>> yesterday's tornado severely damaged a hospital here. It's right to my right here in moore, oklahoma. The second floor is almost completely torn off. Cars in the parking lot are piled into stacks. Patients have to be moved to other hospitals in the area. Cnn's kyung lah has been to one of those hospitals, speaking with storm victims. That's how she discovered the story of a day care owner whose parents are calling a hero. Kyung is joining us now with this amazing story. Share with our viewers what happened, kyung. 
>> Well, before I get into that, wolf, I just want to explain, the building I'm standing in front of is the area's level one trauma center. Yesterday they treated 94 patients, more than half of them were children. And as we spent the day here, we heard the story again and again. Parents, grandparents being separated from their children and frantically trying to find them. I want you to take a lookt this picture. This is an image of what was a day care center. It's right near the elementary school. One of the destroyed elementary schools, brierwood elementary. You can see what's left of this day care center. Inside, two boys, a 3-year-old and 6-year-old, grayson and b braydon. Listen to their grandfather getting stuck in traffic trying to get to the day care center. 
[00:52:02]



>> It's the absolute worst. What do you do? You get upset, but what are you going to do? Swim across the river? I don't know. That's the pits. You know? That's road rage and accelerated. You're just helpless, completely. 
>> I miss my baby. 
>> Your baby? 
>> And you can see this is grayson today. His parents and his grandfather, eventually did find him. He has a head wound. He has some damage to his ear. His 6-week-old brother completely unscathed. Their day care teacher threw a mattress and her body over them. No one at that day care center was killed. It is a miraculous story. Their mother extremely relieved today. But she is certainly mourning for the many other mothers who cannot be as happy as she is. Here's what she told us. 
>> You can tell them it's going to be okay, but honestly, if i lost my boys, I don't know if i could deal with that. You don't feel like it's going to be okay. For those thee hours I didn't hear anything, it was the longest three hours of my life. Knowing that I may never see them again. No mother should ever have to go through that. 
>> And wolf, we are pleased to tell you that the entire family will be going home tonight. They certainly are feeling very, very lucky. Wolf? 
>> That was an incredible three hours, though, that I'm sure they were so, so, so worried. Kyung, thanks so much for that report. Coming up, much more of the devastation continuing, from rescue to recovery. Heart break, to determination, this state, the state of oklahoma, and this town, the oklahoma city metropolitan area, facing a very, very difficult road ahead. Oklahoma's governor, and the mayor of moore, oklahoma, they will both join me live right here, that's coming up. success company where over seventy-five percent of store management started as hourly associates. There's opportunity here. I can use Walmart's education benefits to get a degree, Maybe work in IT, Or be an engineer, helping Walmart conserve energy.

Proudly serving the military for over 75 years. ??e 
[00:57:45]



>>> The tornado carved a path of destruction 17 miles long. Cnn's tom foreman is joining us now with a closer look at that devastating route. Show our viewers what happened, tom. 
>> You know, wolf, investigators are looking at this entire path of this storm, all 17 miles, to see exactly how strong it was each step of the way, particularly when it came cutting through that main swath that. Because that gives them important clues how to design neighborhoods and buildings and try to pre sent damage in the future. They look at targets, the houses, schools, hospital. What are they looking for? Specific keys. The noaa for example has looked at a typical house and said a normal house when hit by this type of wind will start coming apart at about 97 miles an hour. That's been the roof. Pried off like a can opener from all the wind. 132 miles an hour, the walls start coming down. 200 miles an hour it's all gone. Anyplace they see a house completely gone, if there's not a construction flaw, they're going to say, that probably meant 200 miles an hour or more. It's different when you come over to the school here, it's a dierent type of construction. Here you're going to start losing a roof at 101 miles an hour, the walls at 139 and all of it will be gone at about 176. It's actually a weaker building than the homes because it's much bigger, broader rooms within it. Then when you move to something like a hospital, it's a whole different game because there's a lot of concrete, a lot of steel. This is a much more robust structure. Here you talk about more impressive numbers like 114 miles an hour for a roof to go, 148 for the walls to start failing, 210 for it all to go. Although that would be pushing up to 250 or 26 this is a building that doesn't give up much. The bottom line is, wolf, they're going to look at the damage all along the route, and block by block figure out how strong this storm was to get a better assessment and have better planning in the future. It's like following a criminal by looking at the scene of the crime to figure out just exactly what he did. Wolf? 
[00:59:53]



>> They've got to learn lessons from this horrible, horrible tornado. Tom foreman, thanks very much. 
>>> I'm wolf blitzer reporting here in moore, oklahoma. We want to welcome our viewers in the united states and around the world. You're watching a special edition of "the situation room." Here in moore, this is a city scarred, and reeling from a massive tornado that we watched a little more than a day ago, as it leveled block after block after block, miles of this community just south of oklahoma city. One of the major suburbs of oklahoma city. The scope of this disaster, it is still unfolding. You're looking at live ar yal shots of what's going on right now. Here's some of the latest developments we're following. The death toll right now, 24 people, including 9 children, at least 237 people were injured. Search and rescue operations continue. Rescue efforts, they are ongoing. The fire chief hoping crews can reach every structure by tonight. Each will be searched, he says, three times, before being cleared. And the national weather service now says the damage in at least one area indicates the most powerful category of tornado, an ef-5. Said winds reached 210 miles an hour, and the tornado was 1 1/3 miles wide. Emotional scenes are playing out all across this community.As victims return to find homes reduced to rubble, or in some cases, no homes at all. Cnn's brian todd is here. You spoke to some of those people.- And these are heart-wrenching stories. Not a dozen, two dozen, but there are thousands of people who went through hell 24 hours ago. Many of them still reeling. 
>> That's right, wolf. It is repeated all over this town. We saw this after the earthquake in haiti. We saw this after the earthquake and tsunami in japan. We see it right here, right now. Residents walking around their homes, picking up remnants, looking like zombies, shell shocked. They've been doing that all day today trying to pick up remnants of their lives. But that's against the advice of public officials. Many still look dazed as they pick through what's left of their homes. Looking for some sign of order, some symbol of what they had. This may be all they can cling to right now, but the police chief of moore, oklahoma, said now isn't the time to be doing this. 
[01:02:23]



>> It's too dangerous. Too many safety issues. Gas leaks, downed power lines. 
>> Reporter: A risk many residents are willing to take, to look at what they've got left and reflect on close calls. This is southwest 7th street, symbolic of what happened in this tornado and so many others. Some houses here, a lot of the structures are still standing. Then you see on the other side, total devastation. 
>> I was right there in that closet. The hall closet. 
>> Reporter:70-year-old pat casey showed us the remnants of her home, the back face of her house torn apart, windows blown out, much of the roof gone. She showed us the small closet she said she sat and prayed with a quilt over her head as the massive twister pulverized her house. 
>> You could tell it was turning and turning and turning, then i heard everything hitting everywhere. So I knew I had been hit. 
>> What was going through your mind? 
>> Just, god, if it's my time to go, okay. If not, just look out for me, please, I'm not ready. 
>> Reporter: Her daughter, who lives with her, luckily wasn't home at the time. Is this your daughter's room? 
>> That was her sink and then the bath. And the shower. The roof and everything 
-- everything is completely gone all the way across. 
>> Reporter: Pat said the house isn't habitable right now and doesn't know if she can rebuild. Do you want to come back and live here after this experience? 
>> It's my home. If they can fix it. I'm 70 years old now and i probably might consider 
-- if there was any way I could sell it eventual hi. But when things like this happen, it's hard to sell. 
>> Reporter: Now, pat says she has insurance, and she's willing to take a shot at rebuilding. But the strongest factor keeping her here, a handicapped son who lives in a facility nearby who pat said she's responsible for. Wolf, she says because of him, she wants to stay here, no matter what the hardships or the risks are. 
>> I know you've been speaking to authorities, the mayor, the police chief, what are they saying about people still missing. 
[01:04:24]



>> That was a huge factor after the joplin tornado two years ago. We were really concerned that would be the case here. One of the police chiefs, i believe the police chief of oklahoma city told us today, initially they thought about 48 people had gone missing. That's a pretty large figure. But he said as of today they've all been accounted for, with one caveat, except for maybe a few in moore. In this area. So maybe a few left that people are not quite sure where they are yet. Of course, you're asked if you're around and you haven't been contacting family, het them know you're okay. Get in touch with them somehow, find a way. 
>> That's what they're mostly worried about right now. They want to see if they are missing. And they find them. Brian, thanks very much. I want to show our viewers some aerial shots here. There are still some folks who are believed to be missing. People have been watching what's going on very, very closely. We also have live pictures coming in from the other affiliate in oklahoma city, koco, both of these affiliates doing excellent work over these days to show the viewers in the united states and around the world what's going on. And when I say this looks like a war zone, I really do mean it. It looks like a war zone, especially if you look behind me. You see what used to be a bowling alley. It is in complete destruction. Joining us now, one family, the berge family, melanie and their son, billy jr. And their daughter mercedes. Thank you very much for coming in. 
>> Thank you. 
>> You guys went through hell yesterday. 
>> Yes, we did. 
>> I want to bring you all of you into this conversation. 
>> She was at school. He was over at a friend. 
>> What grade are you in? 
>> 6th GRADE. 
>> You were in school, at the plaza elementary school. 
>> The tornado came down the block, me and her went in the closet. And the whole house started shaking and rocking. And shaking for two, three minutes. After that, everything was calm. Went out, everything was just destroyed. And just apart. 
[01:06:33]



>> What was going through your mind as you were in that closet? 
>> I thought 
-- I didn't think we were going to make it. The walls were shaking in the closet. I really didn't think we were going to make it. Just hearing it. I've never experienced nothing like this. 
>> It went right over your house? 
>> Yeah. 
>> How loud was the noise? They say it sounds like a train. 
>> That's what I've heard, and that's exactly what it sounded like. I just heard stuff banging in the house. I thought, any minut's going to take us up. After everything did quiet down, as soon as we walked out, the first thing I seen was this man running with a child. We asked him if he was okay, he said he was going to run to the hospital. We didn't know if the hospital had been hit, too. We started going door to door. The next thing we know, we're thinking, oh, god, we've got to get to the house and get the car and pick up my daughter. Didn't know where my son was at. Because he was going to go to a friend's house. He said he was driving into it, and had to turn back around and leave to get out of it. 
>> You thought everything was fine. 
>> We got in the car to drive over there, by the time we were 
-- I coast see. He jumps out of the car to go running. 
>> You drive over to the school. Billy jr., You're with him, right? 
>> No, we didn't know where he was at this time. 
>> I was driving from my house to my friend's house. I was driving to wyatt jones' house. At the time 
-- I knew there was a tornado going on. I was driving and I just see this big old thing in the sky, start coming at me. I seen it. It was up in the air. I just started taking off. My car started shaking. I'm glad I didn't stay at the 7-eleven, because it took the 7-eleven in a heart beat. And my cousin said he was running up to the plaza towers. We all thought my sister was gone. 
>> Mercedes, you're in the 6th grade. Tell us where you were when the tornado goes over your elementary school. 
>> I had to go in the boys' bathroom and duck my head, put a backpack over my head. 
[01:08:38]



>> The teachers were this with you? 
>> Yeah. 
>> All your whole class went into the boys' bathroom? 
>> Some of them did. 
>> All that could fit in. 
>> And they just said, duck down? How scared were you? 
>> I was a little bit scared. 
>> You're 13 years old, right? And this is the plaza tower. That school was pretty much destroyed, right? 
>> The roof come over. The roof come off. 
>> Her feet lifted off the ground. 
>> Are your classmates okay? 
>> Yeah. I think so. 
>> All of them were okay? Because we know some of the kids in that school didn't make it. 
>> No. 
>> But the younger kids, right? 
>> 3rd GRADE. 
>> You drive over to the school. You're worried about your daughter. Billy, you drive over to the school, too, right? 
>> I drive over there and they wouldn't let me over so I hopped out of my car and took off running. Took off running to the store. 
>> What did you see as you were running into the school? 
>> People hurt. Houses gone. Got to the school and people hurt severely. There was no school. 
>> Because when you got to the school, you didn't even know 
-- you thought that you had 
-- because there was nothing there. 
>> Yeah, there was nothing. 
>> And you knew your daughter was inside. 
>> I was in shock. I'm still in shock. 
>> So how did you find her? 
>> I got to a teacher and they say they moved her to a church down the street. That's where she was at, the 6th graders. Basically it was the 3rd graders that were in trouble. 
>> You guys go to the church. Billy, too, right? 
>> No, I was actually at the house after that. I parked over there at the church, a little one, and I ran all the way to the house to make sure my family was all right. It took me a while to get there, because I was getting stopped all the time. 
>> How did you get to the church? What did your teachers do to get you to the church? 
>> We just walked over there. 
>> How far was it? 
>> Not really that far. 
>> What did you see on the way over there? What was going on? 
[01:10:41]



>> I guess seeing houses torn down, and that's it. 
>> Did you see people who were injured, too? You were fortunate you didn't have to see that. 
>> Yeah. 
>> So then you meet up with your daughter at the church? 
>> Yeah. 
>> Go back home. 
>> How did that feel? 
>> Felt great. 
>> Still feel sad, though, too, because the other kids at school, her friends, people that she knew, it's sad. It's like losing one of mine, you know? We're still in shock. We're all inshock. But we are thankful to have what we do have. Very thankful. 
>> You've got loving parents, you know that. And a nice big brother who loves you very much, it too. Right, billy? Tell her you love her very much. 
>> I love my sister to much. 
>> I want to see that. One big group hug right now. Let's do it. All right. We're happy all of you made it. 
>> Thank you. 
>> Thank you. 
>> Thank you. 
>> We're happy. 
>> I'll give you a hug, too. Thank you. 
>> I'm happy for the whole team. We're all hugging. All right, guys. We'll all be stronger for this. 
>> Thank you, sir. 
>> Thank you.

>>> Welcome back, to moore, oklahoma, right outside oklahoma city, where rescue efforts are continuing after yesterday's massive tornado. Joining us now, two special guests, the mayor of moore, glen lewis, and oklahoma governor mary fallin. Governor, mayor, thanks very much. First of all, our hearts go out to your communities, your state. What a heart-wrenching story. Let's get through some of the specifics first. Are there still people missing? 
>> Well, we are waiting to get further information from our search and rescue squads. I don't have any current information right now. 
>> As of now, we do not. 
>> You do not have additional information or you don't know? 
>> No, we don't have anybody missing. 
>> There's no one missing is this. 
>> According to the reports that I just got. 
>> The search and rescue operation, so we don't ink, you tell me if I'm right or wrong, mayor, there are still people trapped under rubble? 
>> Anywhere there's an orange mark, that means it's been searched twice and a thermal imager has gone over that car. 
>> And it can detect if there's a human inside. 
>> Yes. 
>> The last time I came to oklahoma city for an awful, awful story, was 1995, during the oklahoma city bombing of the murrah federal office building. That building was 
-- you were there at the time, too. You were the mayor. 
>> Yes, sir. 
>> Compare and contrast then and now. 
>> Well, the damage is pretty much 
-- it looks the same. Total devastation. It's remarkable that anyone could survive anything like this. Especially a major tornado that came through of that magnitude and caused such destruction. It's remarkable that we've had not more loss of life at a time when something's been so widespread. We're devastated by the people that have been lost, the children that have been lost. It's been very hard on this community. But we're also very thankful for the response of our emergency personnel, obviously our fire department and police, they've done a tremendous job. 
[01:18:33]



>> Was there anything looking back, 50,000, 60,000 people live here in moore, could you have done anything to prevent the destruction, the damage that occurred? You go through a lot of tornadoes here. 
>> No, sir, I don't think there's anything else that we as a city could have done, or state. Unfortunately there's just natural occurrences. 
>> The warnings went out. People had some notice of what was going on. 
>> They did. 
>> You've spoken to the president, right? 
>> Yes. 
>> He's made a commitment to you, that whatever is necessary, whatever is necessary you will get. 
>> Absolutely. We appreciate the president calling. And several of the cabinet secretaries have called, along with probably over 25 governors have called and offered their assistance. What we have to understand about this situation, and they do, is that people are in need now. We had to first make sure there were no bodies, no people that were injured, that is within this rubble, and hopefully we have been able to find everybody. We've had rescue teams out. We've had dogs out. Heat imaging equipment has been out. So we're getting comfortable with that. But it's still concerting when you see something like this, if you wonder if there might be somebody. We appreciate their fast action on our emergency declaration, we need services now, money on the ground now. We need to help the families who are suffering so much. 
>> I'm sure you'll be getting that. What's the saddest thing you've seen over the last couple of hours? 
>> The president offered complete assistance. We get our money from fema, through the governor's office. She's been excellent. She's been here since the thing occurred. So she's been johnny on the spot, I'm telling you. And everything has been 
-- i mean, the response has been incredible, it really has. 
>> Two sad things. One was late last night, as i made my tours around this community, I went down to the school, the placid tower that was lost. It just took my breath away to see that, and think about parents that have dropped their children off at school in the morning, and as a mother, thinking h I would feel if that were my child and I was the parent who had lost someone. And just knowing that 
-- the heart break. 
[01:20:44]



>> Have you met with some of these families? 
>> I have met with some of the families that have had children that survived. I've tried to give distance to those that have lost someone. 
>> Nine children are dead. 
>> I've actually been in a facility that was a reunification facility at a church. At the time I had gone in there to talk to some of the red cross, I heard several women crying very, very loud. It was very disturbing to hear people crying of that magnitude because they just found out they had lost someone. 
>> Some people have asked me, e-mailed me and twitter, can't something more be done in these elementary schools, bunkers, underground facilities in case of a tornado? 
>> Since the '99 tornado, all the schools have safe rooms in there. Unfortunately, plaza towers was one of the older rooms. Brierwood was a newer model. There was no casualties there. It is very much damaged as much as the pza towers. 
>> Governor, you're going to have to make sure all schools have these safe rooms. You get a lot of tornadoes here. God knows, this could happen again. 
>> We're certainly going to be having a discussion about that. We've already been talking about making the schools more sa they have to have a plan of action, rehearse those things. The schools did respond appropriately. Some schools were actually able to move the children out of the schools before it hit. We were fortunate we didn't have more loss of life. 
>> Any new information coming out of the plaza towers elementary school? It's a pre-k through 6th grade, about 500 kids would normally be attending plaza towers elementary school.It was literally leveled. 
>> Yes. Unfortunately, or fortunately, i guess I should say, lot of parents got their kids out early. Unfortunately not everyone did. 
>> They have a big crane on the site picking up huge pieces of debris, trying to lift that up. A massive site as you've seen on the news. It's going to take a lot of effort to be able to get down to the bottom of the ground. 
[01:22:53]



>> I assume there will be a memorial service at some point? Yes. 
>> The president will probably come. Did he say he wanted to come to attend that? 
>> We haven't talked to the president about coming to a memorial service yet. Because it's just literally happened. But he has called several times and expressed anything that he could, that it took. We haven't decided on the day yet. We want to make sure we give family the opportunities to find their loved ones and make sure everyone's accounted for. We know it's going to take a while to find a place to live, to get clothes on their back and get the immedimedical care that they need. 
>> In 1995, after the murrah federal office building was created, that was man-made destruction. This was a natural disaster. 
>> The memorial service is very important to the healing of the community. Healing of those that have lost so much. It's important for the nation, too. Even for those around the world that are expressing their sympathy, their concern, that are worried about the people of oklahoma. Just for the sake of humanity, to know that people can pull together in such a time of need, especially in prayer. 
>> We're with you, governor. Mayor. Good luck to both of you. 
>> Thank you so much. 
>> Thank you for coming. 
>> You've got a beautiful state. 
>> Great people. 
>> Don't leave yet. A 5th grader talks about the roof of her school caving in. Caving in, and the relief she felt when she was reunited with her family. That's coming up.

>>> Welcome back. I'm wolf blitzer here in moore, oklahoma, right outside of oklahoma city. We're watching this disaster unfold. Still a disaster. It's been a little over 24 hours since a massive tornado tore 17 mile-wide gash through oklahoma. We're just beginning to learn the full scope of the destruction. It is enormous. The state insuranceommissioner says the tornado damage will probably top $1 billion. Now, appears the storm was even more powerful than we originally thought. The national weather service now saying damage assessments show winds reached 200 miles an hour, or even higher. That would make it an ef-5 tornado. The highest level of intensity. Emergency crews have been searching board by board through the rubble. More than 100 people were rescued after the tornado hit. At least 24 people were killed. 237 people were injured. This disaster is hard on everyone here in moore, oklahoma, especially the kids. Many of them huddled this their schools. They were terrified, as the winds howled and the roof and the walls came down. Jake tapper is here covering the story for all of us as well. You spoke to a 5th grader who had ap amazing story. 
>> What's so remarkable is, and we've seen this with all the individuals here in moore, is how much this community has come together and how brave they are this the face of this. But what's really more remarkable is how brave these kids are. We met one of them, her name is lauren fugate. We talked to her about her horrific experience. And really, I don't think I've met very many people as brave as this young girl. 
>> The roof caved in on all of us, while we were in the school. 
>> Where were you? Did you go to thebasement? 
>> The 5th and 6th graders were all huddled in the bathrooms. All we heard was a lot of rumbling, and then stuff falling on our heads. 
[01:30:09]



>> What fell o your head? Parts of the ceiling? 
>> Parts of the roof and stuff. And it fell on my best friend, McKENZIE. 
>> How did the 5th graders do? 
>> A lot of them were scared. But some of them were bleeding worse than others. But yeah. 
>> Did everybody make it? 
>> Most of us did. 
>> And what was it like when you guys found her? I want to get you in here. 
>> They were searching for her. Then one of the teachers, one of the moms had her. And brought her out to me. Shwas covered in dirt. 
>> Had you run to the school? 
>> I had run to her friend's house. That's where she was supposed to be at school. So I was just going to the house, which was gone, looking for her. 
>> Tell me about the moment when you saw her. 
>> Oh, it was very emotional. Kind of in shock. Seeing her all wet and dirty. 
>> She kept it together. 
>> Yeah, we kept it together. 
>> What was it like to see your mommy? 
>> I hugged her and I started crying and saying, I love you, mom. 
>> It must have been a pretty good hug. 
>> Yeah. 
>> A remarkable story from a remarkable young girl. This whole community is full of stories like that. There has been obviously way too much death and destruction. Many, many more survivors and stories like that about people who did survive and were able to be reunited today. 
>> Yeah, this is an area, this is a community, as I said, 50,000 or 60,000 people, this is a major suburb of oklahoma city, a city of about 600,000. Normally we hear these tornadoes go through rural areas. But this is almost like bethesda is to washington, d.C. Areas that you and I know well. 
>> Absolutely. We've been driving around now just to make it to this live shot. And the destruction, you know, a yet. A lot of people at home haven't seen. A lot of areas are cordoned off by police because of downed power lines, or other dangers, or just trying to keep the media out of certain areas. It is really horrific. 
[01:32:14]



>> This used to be a bowling alley. See that bowling ball? 
>> Is that a bowling ball? 
>> Yeah. 
>> Cars were thrown around. 
>> The shrapnel, this type of thing is very dangerous. 
>> Jake will be reporting tomorrow from here as well on "the lead." Thank you very much. 
>> Many americans watched the tornado disaster play out in realtime on television. We've seen gripping pictures of the twister itself. And the damage it left behind. Our mary snow has been going through all of the video that's been coming in to cnn. 
>> Oh, my gosh. 
>> This is what it looked like coming face to face with a tornado that ripped through moore, oklahoma. 
>> Please, dear god, keep these people safe. Lots of debris in the air. 
>> Is that a vortice on the side? It's unrecognizable. 
>> Houses are leveled. 
>> This doesn't even look like it was a development. 
>> For those in its path, a frantic race for cover. 
>> Very loud, and you could see stuff flying everywhere. Just about like on the movie "twister." 
>> They said it was coming. We were like, what do we do? Do we have time to get in the vehicle to outrun it? We have pets. Or do we just hunker down. So we grabbed our motorcycle helmets and hid in the closet and prayed like hell. And luckily the only reason we were spared is the room we were in. 
>> Caught outside with nowhere to go, this couple hid in a storm ditch. 
>> I just kept saying over and over again, please, god, let us be safe. Just protect us. Then, you know, while we were down under there, I honestly felt like it was going to suck us up in there. Because there was like 
-- it was too open. It was open on one side, open on the other, just like a bridge. So I just kept praying to god. 
>> For some parents whose prayers were answered after the brierwood elementary school took a direct hit, words fail to describe their relief. Brenda seeing her son camden says it all. 
[01:34:30]



>> Communities wiped out in a matter of minutes. Miles and miles of destruction. Those who made it say they feel lucky just to be alive. And within the rubble, there is resilience. 
>> Just phenomenal. Not a good phenomenal at all. We're going to be okay. We're going to get back. We're definitely oakies, and that's what we're known for. We come back, and arms aswinging. 
>> Mary snow reporting. Thousands of people, thousands of stories like that. Not just dozens, or even hundreds, thousands of powerful stories that we're going to catch up with over the next several days. Up next, dozens who survived the tornado, they bare physical scars right now. Our own dr. Sanjay gupta is here. We'll talk about the kind of injuries he's seeing. And weather experts take us inside the massive twister. A dangerous swirl of wind and debris. end but a friend under water is something completely different. I met a turtle friend today so, you don't get that very often. It seemed like it was more than happy to have us in his home. So beautiful. AVO: More travel. More options. More personal. Whatever you're looking for Expedia has more ways to help you find yours. people question: How old is the oldest person you've known? We gave people a sticker and had them show us. We learned a lot of us have known someone who's lived well into their 90s. And that's a great thing. But even though we're living longer, one thing that hasn't changed much is the official retirement age. ??? ??? the question is how do you make sure you have the money you need to enjoy all of these years. ??? ??? American story. I'm a teacher. I'm a firefighter. I'm a carpenter. I'm an accountant. A mechanical engineer. And I shop at Walmart. Truth is, over sixty percent of America shops at Walmart every month. I find what I need, at a great price. And the money I save goes to important things. Braces for my daughter. A little something for my son's college fund. When people look at me, I hope they see someone building a better life. 
[01:37:27]


VO: Living better: That's the real walmart. 
>>> Joining us now, craig fugate, from fema. The president sent him here to help out. How does this compare, mr. Fugate, to other destruction you've seen in recent years? 
>> Well, unfortunately, tornado damage is pretty intense. Joplin, tuscaloosa, again here in oklahoma, similar. Very devastating. Houses taken down to the slabs. Schools destroyed, hospital destroyed. Cars just 
-- no way you would think people could survive this. 
>> So what are you doing now? What is fema, the federal government doing to help? 
>> Well, first thing we did is we sent additional urban rescue teams to support the state. They had a lot of area to cover. The other thing is, the president last night did declare these areas disaster areas. So we can start registering people for assistance, and getting them some financial assistance if they didn't have insurance, getting them a place to stay. That process started last night. And we're encouraging people to register, call 1-800-fema to register to start that assistance. 1-800-600-fema. 
[01:39:54]



>> A lot of us have been really shaken by what we saw at plaza towers elementary school. Pre-k through 6th grade. Literally leveled. What can be done to avoid this down the road? Because kids were killed in that school. 
>> Well, there's a lot of things that we'll do in the assessment part of it, from the weather services. This was an f-5 tornado. This is something that has to be taken a look at in the aftermath of this storm. 
>> Did you go over to that elementary school, mr. Fugate, plaza towers? 
>> Yeah, we just left there. I was with the governor. We went there, several of the other areas this the neighborhoods, as well as the hospital. And when you go there, you can see that literally, the walls are gone, roofs are gone. A lot of structural damage. You can just imagine what it was like there. 
>> Give us a comparison. Because you've been through this your whole career, whether in florida or katrina, all sorts of disasters. You walk through a school like that. W what goes through your mind? 
>> You know, you look at all this damage, wolf, and you just wonder how people survived, and the fact that the death toll wasn't even higher. Then you it I about the children in that school and what it was like when of the storm was hitting. Again, it had to be terrifying. So even though you see it, it's a constant, you know, you just don't believe what can happen, and what nature can do. So again, it's just a reminder, we always have to be prepared. 
>> People are watching us right now here in the united states and around the world, and they are moved. Is there onepecific piece of advice you have, if people want to help, what should they do? 
>> Again, this is going to be long-term, and it may sound callous, but I'm going to tell you, the best thing people can do is be generous with their dollars and give for not only the initial response, but they're going to be here for weeks and months to rebuild this community. They're not going to need more stuff, they're going to need your generous donations. A lot of the volunteer groups will help folks. We all have a role to play. That's the best way to help with this type of disaster, give generously to the volunteer organizations so they can help the folks impacted by this disaster. 
[01:42:24]



>> And folks, go to our website cnn.Com/impact if you want to impact your world. There are good recommendations, right there. Good advice, mr. Fugate. Thanks very much for coming here to oklahoma. We'll touch base with you tomorrow as well. Thank you.

>>> We're here in moore, oklahoma, right outside of oklahoma city, right next to me the moore medical center which took a direct hit from this massive tornado. Amazingly, not one fatality inside. Our chief medical correspondent, dr. Sanjay gupta is here. When we look at the destruction, the cars just flying all over the place. The roof's destroyed. And everybody survived. 
[01:46:37]



>> Cars literally going into the building. This is the second time, remember in joplin, the hospital was also in the path of the storm. Here, the second floor literally torn off. I just talked to the doctor who was sort of in charge of the hospital at the time. They didn't get a lot of notice. They had some notice, but not a lot of notice. As she said to me, this is oklahoma. They have a pretty good idea of how to do things. They sort of got everyone, just as you would predict, in the throwing them over them, blankets, to protect them from shrapnel injuries. They got out without a scratch. 
>> Speaking of shrapnel injuries, the danger, disaster, stuff flying around. 
>> You know, a lot of these storms have a primary wave of injuries from the wind itself. The secondary wave, shrapnel. Feel !That. This is wrought iron. 
>> Flying around at 200 miles an hour. 
>> Those are the types of injuries they saw. Lots of injuries that were essentially impalements from shrapnel, crush injuries as a result of falling debris. Good news is not many brain or head yaers. 
>> Why is that? 
>> Because they think people knew in part enough to protect their heads. Throw blankets, mattresses over their head to protect their heads. I was just asking the doctor the same thing, they're not sure. But it's so ingrained in a part of the country where tornado are so common. 
>> I spoke to several people who said they put even football helms as a protective device. 
>> Right. After the shrapnel injuries, bodies moving against a hard surface. The wall of a house or something. 
>> I see this destruction, and I'm amazed that 24 people died, you think of 50,000, 60,000 people, in this community. 
>> I cannot 
-- it's 
-- the images, it's hard to do justice on television to what we're seeing over here. I can't believe it either. I thought it would be much worse. In many places not prepared for things le this, I think it would have been. Give credit where credit is due. A lot of people knew what to do in this situation. They got into a safe place. 
[01:48:55]



>> This was the bowling alley, now it's rubble.

>>> The destruction here stretches for 17 miles. A lot of it caused by massive, massive debris. We sent a team to analyze video of the twister to learn more about those flying killer objects. Here's cnn's joe johns. 
>> Wolf, we're here with paul of the national we her service. Paul, if you would, just give us a sense of what this video tells us about the tornado, as you look at it. 
>> We're looking at a, what looks like a really wide tornado, violent just based on being able to pick out individual chunks of debris swirling around. These are large chunks of debris. Two-by-fours, chunks of trees. In a minute we'll see the roof of a house. 
>> That's the roof of a house. 
>> The whole roof just came off. 
>> Getting lifted off the house. Then smashed into other structures. That flash right there was another transformer popping, taking out a power line and exploding the transformer. 
>> How far up does this funnel cloud go is this. 
>> So the tornado could well be well over 10,000 feet deep. Up here where it's rotating this way, it's what we call a mesocyclone. The tornado is usually within that larger rotation. This is a much broader rotation. Whereas the tornado is a smaller feature within that mesocyclone rotating much more rapidly. That's what does all the damage at the ground is that tornado. 
>> The stuff out here obviously is going to be the first stuff to hit the ground. It will stay up in the air. Any estimation of how long before it comes down, how long it will travel? 
>> Larger chumnks of debris tend to fall up to a half mile or mile from where it's picked up. The smaller pieces of debris, insulation, postcards, checks, things of that nature are so light, they can be lifted into the middle of the thunderstorm, carried over 30,000 feet and slowly once the storm moves away and starts to wind down, hundreds of miles later these checks and the small bits of debris can fall to the ground and people pick them up and find 
-- they trace it back to the original tornado. 
[01:55:05]



>> Where are we in the stage of the tornado right now? Is it at its height when you're looking at that? Or is it sort of winding down? 
>> This is a mature tornado, where the whole screen is filled with the tornado. You can just tell how quickly it's rotating around.

>> Your brain is involved in everything you do, yet few girls or women, ever thi brains. I'll show you five ways to unleash the power of the female brain and the amen clinic's method for radically improving it. It works so well for our patients, I know it can help you too. [Music] >> the information in this program will also help boost your energy, mood and focus and it will help you look and feel younger and more beautiful, no matter what your age. [Music] >> if you adopt the information in this program and apply it with a great attitude, you'll begin to unleash the power of your female brain in a very short period of time. Now is the time to get healthy. You and your loved ones literally have no time to wait. [Audience applauding] >> in this program, award-winning psychiatrist, brain-imaging expert and best-selling author, dr. Daniel amen, will highlight the unique strengths of the female brain and give each woman ways to optimize her brain to improve every area of her life. [Audience applauding] >> thank you so much. Poet ogden nash once said, "i have an idea that the phrase, 'the weaker sex' was actually coined by some women to disarm the man she was preparing to overwhelm." My thought exactly. I've been surrounded by powerful women my whole life. When my mother brought my fifth sister, joanne, home from the hospital, my older brother, jimmy, and I ran away. 

[00:02:01]


Even though it was just for 45 minutes, as the only boys, we had had enough. The girls had taken over and they were everywhere. I often joke that I never saw a bathroom until I was 14 years old and that once I actually got in, there was unusual and frightening stuff scattered all over. Not only was I raised by a very powerful mother who was a champion golfer for decades, i have five highly-successful sisters, three incredible daughters, two beautiful granddaughters and fourteen nieces. My wife says that I came housebroken and well trained when it came to dealing with women, but it was not an easy process. The female brain is very different than the male brain. In a recent study, we compared the scans of 20,000 male and female brains. Red shows the areas of increased activity in females. They're everywhere. Out of 80 areas tested, females were significantly more active in 70, which just explained my whole life. These differences help us understand some of the unique strengths and vulnerabilities of the female brain and give us important clues on how to optimize it. Because of the increased activity, females often exhibit greater strengths in the areas of empathy, intuition, or knowing something that's true without exactly knowing why, collaboration, which is why women often make better bosses, self-control, which is the reason why females go to jail dramatically less often than males, and appropriate worry. In a large study it was found that the don't worry, be happy 

[00:04:01]


people, more typically, men on motorcycles, died earlier from accidents or preventable illnesses. So if you're the type who goes for the bad boys, make sure to buy lots of life insurance on them. But this increased activity also makes females more vulnerable to anxiety, depression, which they have twice as much as men, insomnia, eating disorders, pain and being unable to turn off your thoughts. As a woman, when you understand your brain and how to care for it, there is no stopping you. But when you do not give your brain the love and nutrients it needs, or support it with the right habits, you will never be able to reach your full potential. This program is divided into three parts. In part one, I'll give you five steps to unleash the power of the female brain. It is women who will change the world. And in part two, I'll give you the amen clinic's method for optimizing the female brain. Our success rates with girls and women who struggle with a.D.D., anxiety, depression, obesity and memory problems are very high because of our unique approach. And in part three, I'll talk about the brain-hormone connection. When your hormones are off, your brain can never be its best. I'll also show you how to quiet your brain, to be happier, less anxious and less depressed. If you pay attention to me, it could save you thousands of dollars in therapy. And I'll show you how to create brain-healthy families. Ultimately, it's not just about you. It's about generations of you. The information in this program will also help boost your energy, mood and focus, and it will help you look and feel 

[00:06:03]


younger and more beautiful, no matter what your age. Did you know that the health of your skin is actually an outside reflection of the health of your brain? Okay, let's get started. Unleashing the power of your female brain is so important because it is women who will change the world. Kofi annan, the former u.N. Secretary general, once said that there is no strategy more beneficial to society than the ones in which women play a central role. Women are typically the health leaders of their families. My mother was, my wife is. I know that if mama is healthy and happy and she has great habits, her family tends to follow. But when mama is not healthy or happy or she has bad habits, her family tends to follow that example too. Women also admit problems and reach out for help faster. If a couple is having trouble, nearly eight times out of ten, it is the woman who calls us for help. Or if a child is struggling in school or with his emotions, nearly nine times out of ten, it is the mother who brings him in, even though both parents work full time. I think that the female's ability to admit problems, and get help, is one of the main reasons why women typically live 7 years longer than men, it is also the reason why married men tend to live longer than unmarried men. Their wives harass them to stay healthy. Go to the doctor, take their supplements. But did you know that married women do not get the same longevity boost as unmarried women? In fact, in one study, they 

[00:08:05]


actually had shorter lives, i think it's because the married women are so stressed out by taking care of difficult men. I know that if I can help women get healthy, you have the potential to influence so many others and together we can change the world. Over the last 22 years at the amen clinics, we have looked at 80,000 brain scans on patients from 90 different countries. The study we do is called spect, which looks at blood flow and activity patterns. Spect looks at how the brain works. It basically shows us three things, areas of the brain that are healthy, underactive and overactive. The images on the left show the outside surface of the brain. A healthy scan shows full, even symmetrical activity. The holes indicate areas of low activity. The images on the right show the active views, blue equals average activity, red indicates the most active areas of the brain. In a healthy scan, it's the cerebellum at the back, bottom part of the brain that is typically the most active and everything else is relatively quieter. Early on in our imaging work, it was very clear that on average, female brains tend to be much more active, much busier, while male brains tend to be less active, even a little sleepy. Many men just want to veg out and watch tv while the women in our lives are always thinking, worrying and planning things for us to do. Researchers have found that females have stronger activity in an area of the brain called the prefrontal cortex which is involved with planning, judgment, empathy and 

[00:10:06]


self-control. According to some studies, iq for females is stored more strongly in the front part of their brains, while it is more widely distributed in males, this manes that a frontal lobe injury may hurt females much more than males. Little girls should not be hitting soccer balls with their foreheads. I think of the prefrontal cortex as the brain's break. It helps keep you on track and stops you from saying or doing stupid things. When the prefrontal cortex is low in activity, you can struggle with short attention span, distractibility and problems with impulse control. When it works too hard, as it often does in women, it's like the parking brake is always on and you can get stuck on certain thoughts or behaviors, such as worrying or holding grudges. In area deep in the prefrontal cortex called the anterior cingulate gyrus is also more active in females. It is involved with error detection, which is why you can sometimes focus too much on what is wrong with your body, your children or even your own good husbands, not that I've ever noticed my wife doing that. A study from canada showed that women produce 52% less serotonin than men. This is very important as serotonin helps to calm and relax the prefrontal cortex. Too much serotonin can be trouble as it can lower your prefrontal cortex too much and leave you with less empathy and impulse control. But when serotonin levels are too low, people often struggle with anxiety, depression, pain syndromes, trouble sleeping because you can't let go of negative thoughts, obsessive worry and carbohydrate cravings. 

[00:12:09]


Eating simple carbs like bread, pasta and sugar tend to raise serotonin levels and in the short run they make you feel better, which is why they're called mood foods, but in the long run, they can damage your health. A new study reported that people who eat primarily a carbohydrate-based diet have four times the risk of developing serious memory problems. Plus, just try taking chocolate from some women and there will be trouble. I once had a woman tell me that she would rather get cancer than give up sugar. Researchers have also found that females have more activity in the part of the brain responsible for gut feelings and intuition and they have more activity in the limbic, or emotionally bonding areas of the brain, which is why they tend to be primarily caretakers to children and the elderly and why they often excel at collaboration. So based on these differences, female brains tend to have five special strengths, empathy, intuition, collaboration, self-control and a little worry, but these strengths can also have dark sides. Empathy can morph into an overelming sense that the world is riding on your shoulders and that you have to take care of everyone else before you take care of yourself. Intuition can make you feel anxious as you know something's wrong before you check it out. Sometimes your brain lies to you and you can be worrying about something that just isn't true. Being too collaborative can slow you down. Self-control can turn into trying to control those around you and the worry that is so useful in small doses can stress you to the point where it hurts your brain and your body and 

[00:14:10]


won't allow you to rest. Knowing all this, there are five ways to unleash the power of the female brain. One, always balance empathy with self-care. Women are doing more today than ever before and the constant stress is stealing their health and making them sick. Remember what they say on airplanes, if the masks come down, put yours on first, that way you can be healthy to help others. Women make appointments for everyone else but not themselves. Take the time you need to get healthy. Two, intuition is an important skill that keeps us alive and gives women and important edge. My friend, cynthia stamper graff, is a ceo who places high value on intuition. She believes it offers lindora, her primarily female organization, a competitive advantage. "If you tap into it," she says, "you can get to solutions faster, but it's always important to check out your feelings with facts." For example, you might walk by a coworker who doesn't look up when you walk by and think she's mad at you but, in fact, she just might have had a fight with her husband, you don't know. Once you have a thought, check it out. I often tell my wife and daughters, "please don't read my mind. I have enough trouble reading it myself." Three, boost collaboration by working to include others. A recent article in the "harvard business review" was titled, "what makes a business team smarter?" The answer was more women. Men tend to be competitive while women are more collaborative and focused on group cohesion. This is why women often make great bosses. 

[00:16:11]


They have the gifts of empathy, collaboration, intuition and they also tend to make fewer risky decisions when they're stressed. But be careful with too much collaboration, setting appropriate boundaries and learning to say no is critical to effective leadership and your health. Four, self-control is so important to keeping you healthy. You can boost your self-control by making sure your blood sugar is stable. This is one he most important things I'll tell you in this program. When blood sugar levels go low, blood flow to the brain goes low and you make more bad decisions. To stay in control, start the day with some protein, then eat smaller meals throughout the day to make sure to not get hungry. I've included a cookbook by my wife, tana, in the program materials that is filled with great-tasting, brain-boosting recipes. Also, get at least 7 hours of sleep at night or your self-control disappears. In the program materials, there's a whole section on improving your sleep, including what supplements can help, i especially like magnesium and melatonin. And five, balance worry with wellness. Some anxiety is good, especially if it keeps you on track, but too much is painful. To get your anxiety under control, look for natural ways to support healthy serotonin levels. Exercise can do it, as can certain supplements like 5-htp, b6 and saffron. In fact, in persian culture, people say that if you're too happy, you must have gotten into the saffron. There are now multiple studies showing that saffron can help boost your mood, memory, 

[00:18:13]


even help with pms. In addition, stay connected to strong group of friends, it is often your best medicine. My sister, mary, is a very special person. She runs her own successful insurance agency and has raised four wonderful children, despite the fact her first husband died of cancer when the kids were very young. Several years ago, mary fell in love with marty, a really great guy and they were engaged to be married. Then one morning last year, i got a call from my niece who was crying. It was one of those calls where you immediately know something is wrong and that everything is about to change. She said that marty, at the age of 56, without any warning, had died in his sleep. It was devastating and more so because it happened to mary a second time. Yet because mary had great empathy for others and was a master at collaboration, she had built her own tremendous social support network. Her friends loveieience applauding] 

[00:30:16]


>> welcome back. In this segment, I'm gonna show you how to radically boost the health of your female brain. At the amen clinics, our success rates with girls and women who want to improve their physical and mental health are very high because we take an integrated approach to understanding and healing their brains. Our method involves three very clear steps. One, assess the four circles of your le, biology, psychology, social and spiritual. Females never get fully well in isolation and it takes engaging all of these circles. Two, test your brain to see how it functions. This should be done regularly to catch any problems early and to target help specifically to your brain. And three, it is critical to always be working to boost your brain's reserve. This will give you remarkable progress in a very short period of time. I love our four-circle approach because it helps girls and women get better in the most balanced way possible. The first circle is your biology, or the physical processes that make you who you are. It includes your genes, as many health problems run in families. What issues run in your family, a.D.D., Alcoholism, anxiety, depression, alzheimer's disease? All of these have genetic components, but genes typically don't cause problems. They make you more vulnerable to them. A close friend of mine had both her mother and grandmother die of alzheimer's disease. She also had a gene that increased her risk for it. Her brain spect scan also suggested she was vulnerable to it. 

[00:32:16]


Here you can see the areas of low activity, yet knowing her risk caused her to proactively take steps to make her brain as healthy as possible and decrease her risk for alzheimer's disease. And over time, her brain got better and she felt much better. Your genes are not your destiny. Also in the biology circle is your diet, exercise, sleep habits, hormone levels and overall physical health. Diabetes, hypertension, heart disease all damage the brain, plus it's important to know if you've had any brain injures. Your brain is soft and your skull is really hard. Brain injuries can ruin a person's life and few people know about it. Sabrina came to see me for anxiety and depression. She also had bad temper problems. Her spect scan showed evidence of an injury. When I asked her about it, she didn't remember any but her mother, who was in the room, started to cry. She told us of a time when sabrina fell down the stairs when she was 18 months old and was unconscious for 2 hours. Healing the injury was critical to her recovery. Also in this circle are things like food allergies and toxins, such as drugs or alcohol, pesticides or mold exposure. Here is a scan of a 52-year-old woman who was drinking too much. When she saw the toxic, bumpy appearance, she immediely stopped the alcohol. That was a sign of intelligent life. It is impossible for your brain to heal when it's in a toxic environment. The second circle is your psychology, or how you think. This is such an important circle because accurate, grateful 

[00:34:16]


thinking actually helps your brain work better while negative thinking makes you more vulnerable to anxiety and depression. In the next segment, we'll talk a lot about how to get your thoughts working for you instead of against you. The psychology circle also contains your body image, such an important issue for females, significant developmental events and any past psychological traumas, which even though they're in the past, can still be bouncing around your brain and wreaking havoc in your life. When my wife, tana, was 4 years old, she remembers her mother and grandmother falling to the floor sobbing the day they found out her uncle had been brutally murdered shortly thereafter, tana developed abdominal pain and spent many hours in the doctor's office undergoing painful procedures. Her gut problems persisted into adulthood and it wasn't until she dealt with the past psychological trauma that her gut symptoms setted down. In one study, 75% of women with persistent gi problems experienced early emotional trauma. Biology and psychology always work together. Next is the social circle. We are relational species, which is especially true for females. When your relationships are great, you tend to feel happy, but when they're strained, or you feel isolated, you're more likely to get depressed for a while. Plus, people are contagious. Research says that the health of the people you spend time with is one of the biggest factors in determining your health. If your family and friends aren't healthy, you are more likely to die earlier. This doesn't mean you have to get rid of all of your unhealthy family and friends. 

[00:36:19]


Be even leaner and model a new way of living. The fastest way to get healthy is to find the healthiest person you can stand-- and then spend as much time around her as possible. The last circle is spiritual, which you rarely hear doctors talk about, but this, in fact, may be the most important circle. Here you ask yourself the big questions, what does your life mean? Why are you here? What is your purpose? Having a deep sense of meaning and purpose gives you reason to get up in the morning and take great care of your brain. My friend, sandra, lost her 24-year-old daughter to a terrible car accident. As any parent can imagine, it was devastating but instead of just letting the pain eat her away, she used it to help other families who had also lost children. She discovered that by giving back, it helped her heal. As sandra learned to love her brain, she recruited her sisters to get healthy and they got better together. Know what drives you, write it down and look at it every day. The next step in our method is to test your brain. Regularly assessing your brain is critical to getting the right help and catching any problems early. At the amen clinics, we use brain spect imaging to help us understand and treat our patients. The images have changed everything I do in my own life and how I help my patients, but a long time ago I realized not everyone can get a scan so based on thousands of scans, i developed a series of questionnaires, and now online tests, to help you know about your brain. 

[00:38:19]


These assessment tools are in the program materials. For now, I want to give you 8 lessons I've learned from looking at 80,000 scans, especially as they relate to the female brain. Lesson number one, your brain is involved in everything you do, yet few girls or women ever think about their brains. We let little girls hit soccer balls with their heads and do dangerous gymnastic routin. Women spend hours in toxic, nail or hair salons, never thinking about what the fumes may be doing to their brains. Hair and nail stylists have one of the highest incidences of alzheimer's disease. Lesson two, when your brain works right, you work right and when your brain is troubled, you are more likely to have trouble in your life. Here are two spect scans. The one on the left is of a healthy woman, the one on the right is her identical twin sister who had a near-drowning episode when she was 10 years old. Even though they're identical, the sister with the brain damage has struggled much more in her life. Lesson number three, as we've seen, the female brain is typically much more active than the male brain, which makes girls and women more vulnerable to anxiety and depression. Lesson four, through our brain imaging work we've discovered that it's really smart to start with natural treatments to calm your worries and boost your mood. Certain anti-anxiety medicines have been recently associated with a higher incidence of serious memory problems and dementia. Supplements, meditations and guided imagery can be so helpful in calming anxiety. Here is a scan of a woman before and after doing a simple meditation exercise. 

[00:40:19]


Lesson number five, many things can hurt the brain, including alcohol and drug abuse. Marijuana is not going green. Environmental toxins like working in a hair salon, cancer chemotherapy--how unfair is that? Anesthesia, for certain vulnerable people, low thyroid, even being overweight. Did you know that there are 22 brain imaging studies that now report as your weight goes up, the size and function of your brain go down. Ouch. But the good news is that we can help your brain heal. Here is the scan of a woman who suffered from brain fog and memory problems after having chemotherapy and then again 4 months later after being on our program. Lesson six, you will work hard to decrease your risk or alzheimer's disease because it is more common in women and actually starts in the brain decades before you have any symptoms. The best way to lower your chances of getting alzheimer's disease, no matter what your age, is to decrease all of the risk factors associated with it, such as depression, a.D.D., Or attention deficit disorder, diabetes, hypertension, obesity and sleep apnea. These are all potentially preventable or treatable problems. Lesson number seven, you will think about your brain and the brain of your partner when your relationship is in trouble. Sometimes people who are hard to get along with can have significant brain problems. Here is an example of a man who was exposed to environmental toxins at work. He was chronically stressing out his wife who told him that if he didn't get help, she w 

[00:42:21]


leaving. At our clinics we hear this all the time. There is help for couples but if you never look at the brain, how would you ever know if he just had a bad attitude or his brain needed help? And lesson number eight, you will always protect the front part of your brain, which helps you with judgment, planning and impulse control. I want to spend a little time here and talk about a.D.D., Or attention deficit disorder, in girls and women, it is much more common than most people know. Doctors typically talk about two types, a.D.D. With hyperactivity also called adhd, and a.D.D. Without hyperactivity called inattentive a.D.D.. Boys tend to have the first type, which can be really irritating so they get diagnosed, while the girls tend to have the second type and suffer silently struggling in school, at work or in their relationships. A.D.D. Is most often associated with low activity in the prefrontal cortex. The hallmark symptoms are short attention span, distractibility, disorganization, restlessness and often problems with impulse control. In addition, women with a.D.D. Are often sensitive to noise so they may sleep with ear plugs or a fan on at night so they don't hear everything in the house. And because of the distractibility, they often have sexual problems. What does an orgasm require, besides a reasonable lover? Attention. You have to pay attention to the feeling long enough to make it happen. Getting a.D.D. Treated can make you and your partner so much 

[00:44:22]


happier. Females with a.D.D. Also tend to be conflict-seeking as a way to turn their brains on so they tend to pick on the people they love. Do you know anyone like this? When mary grew up in the 1950s, no one knew about a.D.D.. She did poorly in school and was beaten by the nuns for talking back, zoning out and being unable to focus. As an adult, she went through many relationships, yet despite her struggles, she started a very successful business manufacturing pet products but was often in conflict with her adhd brother who worked with her. A.D.D. Often runs in families. Getting them both treated made a big difference for themselves personally, plus they stopped complaining about each other and the business did much better. If you or a loved one has any of these symptoms, get it checked out. Medicine can help as can natural ways such as a higher protein diet, exercise and certain supplements including a specific type of fish oil called epa fish oil. So far in our method, we've discussed knowing the four circles, biology, psychology, social and spiritual and testing your brain on a regular basis so that you know how it functions. The last step is to always work to boost your brain's reserve. I coined this term after looking at tens of thousands of scans. Brain reserve is the extra cushion of brain function you have to deal with whatever stresses come your way. The more reserve you have, the better you can cope with hormonal swings, loss and aging. Have you ever wondered why two people can be in exactly the same car accident and experience the same impact and one person walks away unharmed while the 

[00:46:25]


other has serious cognitive or emotional problems? In large part, it's due to how much brain reserve they had before the accident. Brain reserve starts before you're even born. When you were conceived, if your mother ate well, took her vitamins and wasn't under a lot of stress, she was building your reserve. But if she drank, smoked or ate poorly, you likely started with less reserve. In the same way, throughout the rest of your life, you are either building or depleting your reserve. Being raised in a loving, stable, healthy environment strengthens your reserve, while getting a concussion from playing contact sports, or being chronically stressed or fed junk food, drains your reserve. And unfortunately as we age, the brain becomes less and less active making you more vulnerable to problems. By the time you have symptoms, your reserve is gone and your brain is struggling. But the really good news, no matter what your age, you can boost your reserve and make your brain look and feel younger. The program materials, there's a detailed plan on exactly how to do that. The simplest way to start is by playing a game my daughter chloe and I have played since she was 2. I call it chloe's game. Whenever you do something, ask yourself, "is this good for my brain or bad for it?" 

[01:09:02]


[Audience applauding] >> welcome back. So far we've talked about five ways to unleash the power of the female brain and the amen clinic's method for radically improving it. In this segment, I'm gonna go deeper and talk about the brain hormone connection. When your hormones are off, your brain will never be its best. I'll also show you how to be happier, less anxious and less depressed by getting control of your thoughts, and I'll show you how, by changing your brain, you can change those you love. Ultimately, it's not just about you, it's about generations of you. One of my patients, billie jean, once said, "i knew something was wrong with me when my usual sweet, charming brain thought it was okay to flip someone off on the freeway today." Shortly thereafter I had the opportunity to scan billie jean during the worst time of her cycle and then during the best. The scans looked like they were from two different people. During the worst time, the part of her brain that got stuck on negative thoughts was up and her prefrontal cortex was down, ruining her impulse control, hence the middle finger. During the best time of her cycle, her brain looked so much better. Hormones have a huge impact on brain health, especially for women. When your hormones are balanced, you tend to feel happy and energetic. When your hormones are off, no matter what your age, everything is harder. Most women are concerned about estrogen and progesterone, as they should be, but it is also critical to know about testosterone, thyroid, insulin and cortisol. Estrogen helps you think clearly, progesterone helps you 

[01:11:02]


relax. These hormones drive your menstrl cycle but they're also critical for your brain. Too much estrogen makes you feel anxious and irritable, sort of like a wet cat. Too little can make you depressed and confused le many women feel at the end of their cycle or through menopause. A number of imaging studies have shown that blood flow to the brain goes down during menopause, which helps explain some of the depression and memory problems that are common. Estrogen has been shown to boost blood flow to the brain. When appropriate, I often recommend bio-identical estrogen replacement. Progesterone is the brain's natural tranquilizer that calms and soothes the brain. When levels go low, anxiety and insomnia go up. Most women don't know that progesterone levels actually start to decrease about 10 years before menopause so all of a sudden in their late 30s or early 40s, many women start to feel anxious and irritable and rely on wine, tranquilizers or sleeping pills to quiet their minds. A little natural progesterone can be so helpful. Testosterone is not just for men. It's critical for your libido, moods and memory. Low levels can make you feel depressed and foggy headed and with no interest in sex. Now, that doesn't sound like fun for anyone. While high levels can give you facial hair, less empathy and always thinking of sex. Sort of sounds like a guy. Your thyroid helps to determine your metabolism. Too little and you feel like a slug, too much and you feel 

[01:13:02]


anxious and frazzled. A third of all depressions have been related to thyroid imbalances. Insulin is involved with blood sugar regulation. Low sugar levels can make you feel foggy and slow and high levels, over time, are a disaster for your brain because it causes your blood vessels to become brittle and they're more likely to break. In a new study, even blood sugar levels at the higher end of normal caused the brain to shrink, which, of course, is a very bad thing. Insulin problems can lead to diabetes, depression and dementia. And cortisol is the major stress hormone. You need it when you're under acute stress, but when your stress levels are high for a long period of time, cortisol can damage your brain, put fat on your belly and make you sick. In the program materials, there's a lot of great information to help you balance your hormones, including a detailed questionnaire. For now, here are five natural ways to boost your hormones. One, you've gotta get your diet right, especially by increasing fiber and getting rid of the simple carbohydrates. Fiber helps you eliminate the harmful estrogens that increase your risk of cancer and keeps your gut healthy. Sugar and high glycemic foods, foods that quickly turn to sugar like flour, pasta, potatoes, rice and most processed foods, disrupt hormone production, cause insulin resistance and weight gain. Also, avoid any meats given hormones or antibiotics as these both disrupt your hormones. Two, make sure your body is clean of toxins. Eat organic whenever possible, as pesticides disrupt your 

[01:15:03]


hormones, and limit your exposure to plastics which contain chemicals that negatively affect your estrogen levels. Three, losing excess weight is critical. Fat stores toxins that disrupt your hormones and cause the conversion of healthy testosterone into unhealthy forms of estrogen. Being overweight disrupts your fertility and makes menopause harder. Plus as we've seen, when your weight goes up, the size of your brain goes down. You literally have no time to wait to get healthy. Four, exercise is critical to maintaining healthy hormones. It helps balance insulin and testosterone and lowers cortisol, in addition it can help with depression because exercise helps to boost serotonin levels. I especially like coordination exercises like dancing and table tennis and strength training for women. The stronger you are as you age, the less likely you are to get alzheimer's disease. Of course, talk to your doctor first. She'll be thrilled. And five, targeted brain smart supplements can help, for example, b6, magnesium and calcium for pms. Fish oil has been shown to help hot flashes. Zinc can support healthy testosterone levels, chromium and cinnamon can help balance blood sugar levels, plus cinnamon is a natural aphrodisiac for men if he needs a little help. And l-theanine from green tea can help calm the brain and lower stress hormones. If needed, work with an experienced health-care provider, sometimes taking hormones can be life saving. Soothe your mind. I want to give you two powerful tools I use with my n patients 

[01:17:03]


to help them decrease stress and boost their moods. If you make these a regular practice, they can save you thousands of dollars in therapy. I'm not saying you won't need therapy. But it can go so much faster. Research has shown these techniques can boost your mood, lower your anxiety and help you sleep. They can even help you lose weight. The first technique I call killing the ants. Ant stands for automatic negative thoughts, the thoughts that come into your mind automatically and ruin your day. You don't have to believe every stupid thought you have. Thoughts lie, they lie a lot and it is these un-investigated thoughts that ruin your life. To get control of your mind, you first have to get control of your thoughts. Women are especially vulnerable to ant attacks in the last week of their cycles and during menopause. To be your best, it is critical to develop an internal anteater to eliminate the ants. In the program materials I talk about nine different types of ants or ways your mind can distort things to make you feel awful. For now, let me give you two of the most common types for women. The first type is fortune telling ants or arbitrarily predicting that things will turn out badly even though you don't have any evidence for it. Almost all of my anxious women or panic-disorder patients are masterful at creating artificial disasters in their heads. The second type is mind reading or thinking that you know what another person is thinking, even though she hasn't told you. I have 25 years of education and I can't tell what anybody else is thinking. A negative look from someone else may mean nothing more than he's constipated. 

[01:19:05]


You don't know. I teach my patients something called the 18/40/60 rule which says when you're 18, you worry about what everybody thinks of you, and when you're 40, you don't give a damn what anybody thinks of you and when you're 60, you realize no one has been thinking about you at all. People spend their days worrying and thinking about themselves, not you. Killing the ants is not hard, the children I see do it all the time. After three sessions, taylor, an 8-year-old girl I saw for depression, told me it was an ant ghost town in her head. It just takes a little bit of discipline and consistent practice. The first thing to do is start keeping a journal, writing in a journal, all by itself, has tremendous health benefits because it makes your thoughts and your behaviors more conscious. Then do this exercise, whenever you feel sad, mad, nervous or out of control, write down exactly what you're thinking. The act of writing down your thoughts helps you get them out of your head. Next, identify if your thoughts are true or if they fall into one of the nine ant tegories. If they do, talk back to them. In the book and online, there are dozens of examples to help you. You are very powerful, but you always want to be powered by honest thoughts, not lies. In addition to killing the ants, I've also found that guided imagery and deep relaxation techniques are extremely powerful in calming and soothing the female brain. They can also help decrease stress and relax your body. When I was an intern at the walter reed army medical center, I was known for using these techniques to help my patients 

[01:21:06]


sleep and calm their anxiety. I also ran groups for the nurses to help them with stress and weight control. One day after a group, a very pretty nurse came up to me and asked me if I would help her get pregnant... Using guided imagery, get your mind out of the gutter. She and her husband had been trying for 4 years and it just wasn't working. Every time after they had sex, her mind was filled with ants and she'd start crying. I explained to her that her uterus and fallopian tubes were wrapped in smooth muscle and whenever she felt stressed, they would constrict making it less likely she'd get pregnant. I made a deep relax audio for her to listen to after sex to soothe her mind and relax her organs. Three months later, she told me she was pregnant. But I didn't do myself any favors when I went home that night and told my wife that i helped a very pretty nurse at work get pregnant. Krystle is my beautiful niece who helps run our newport beach clinic. Several years ago as she was planning her wedding, she developed crushing chest pain and ended up in the emergency room. When they didn't find anything wrong with her heart, I knew it was anxiety. She responded so well to the deep relaxation program I made for her and had no more chest pain. My wife also uses our audios to quiet her mind and help her sleep. She says if they answer particularly loud, she just turns up the volume. Creating brain-healthy families, it is women who will change the world. I see it everywhere I go.

When you get this message of hope and healing and give it away, you get to keep it forever. Together with my friends mark hyman and mehmet oz, we created a program called the daniel plan to get one of the largest churches in america healthy. Over the first year, saddleback church lost over 250,000 pounds and our 15,000 participants reported better energy, focus, sleep, mood and self-control. Eighty-five percent of our participants were women and we found that when they got healthy, their families often followed. After church one sunday, a woman told me she lost 40 pounds on our program and her mind felt 20 years younger. Initially, her 300-pound husband was resistant to doing the program with her, and I love the fact that she didn't get mad at him. She just told him she'd be enjoying her life long after he was dead. But as he saw her get really healthy, he decided to join her and is now down 75 pounds. Their children have also gotten healthy too. Jeanine took my wife's course at the amen clinics to get healthy because she was suffering from fibromyalgia and brain fog. Within 2 weeks, her pain was gone and her mind was sharper. By the end of the program, she and her husband were down 15 pounds and she told me she was sharing what she learned at work. By giving away her new knowledge, she was creating her own support group making it more likely she'd stay on the program for a lifetime. Get it, give it away, keep it forever. Your behavior, good or bad,

influences those around you. As americans, we covet our freedom. We don't like anyone telling us what to do, especially when it comes to our own bad habits. Think of the controversy over the ban on supersized sodas in new york city. But the unfortunate reality is that your behavior is not just about you, it's about generations of you. A new field of genetics has grown up in the last 20 years called epigenetics. It refers to the recent discoveries that your behaviors can turn on, or off, certain genes making illnesses more or less likely to happen in yourself, your children, your grandchildren, even your great grandchildren. Your choices don't just affect you.

Wild Kratts is made possible by The Corporation for Public Broadcasting and by contributions to your PBS station from viewers like you. Thank you. Hi, we're the Kratt Brothers. I'm Martin. And I'm Chris. And it might look like we're just for a walk in the woods. And we are, but this is a special walk because we're taking an orphaned pup for her first stroll. BOTH: A wolf pup. She's about 4 weeks old and this is the time a wolf pup first starts coming out of the den. (Laughing) Are you ready to explore? Huh? It's hard to believe this cute little pup is gonna grow into the top predator of the north. It's a big world out there. You like exploring the wild, huh? Her fur is woolly and warm and ready to take on the cold northern weather. (Laughing) And her teeth are pretty sharp, too, already. And even though she's small, not so tough, and could never survive on her own yet, she's already doing something very... Very... Very... ...Wolf-like. She can already howl. And because howling is all about talking to other wolves, we've got to be those other wolves and get her going. (Howling) (Howling) (Howling) (Howling) (Howling) Imagine if we could really, really talk to wolves. If we could talk to them so well that we could join the wolves and run with the wolf pack. What if? ?????? On adventure with the coolest creatures ?????? ?????? From the oceans to the trees ?????? ?????? The Brothers Kratt are going places you never get to see ?????? ??????

(Laughing) MARTIN: Woohoo! That was the best adventure yet! AVIVA: You're back! Oh, and wow about that wolf pack? Their long-distance running power is so impressive. But with no wolf powers, running like that can really tire you out. I was tired just watching! (Laughing) But that cougar surprise sure woke me up! (Growling) Huh? (Gasping) I didn't put this in my backpack. (Gasping) It's kind of round, soft and fuzzy. It's breathing! And licking my hand? (Laughing) It's a wolf cub! (Howling) (All howling) (Laughing) I'm going to name him Little Howler. Aw! He's like a ball of wool. (Howling) How did he learn to howl already? A wolf pup can howl when he's 3 weeks old. MARTIN: And first come out of the den at 4 weeks. Little Howler's just 4 weeks old. When did he get into your backpack? How'd he get into your backpack? Why didn't we notice him get into your backpack? I have no idea. Me either. We didn't see a pup in the pack. Not that pack, I mean the wolf pack. Where did he come from? We've got a mystery on our hands. The Mystery of the Little Howler. (Howling) Hmm. I know how to figure out where. Just like when Jimmy loses the keys to the Tortuga. To find, just retrace your steps. Okay, let's see. It all started this morning... when we were running through the woods getting started on another adventure. ?????? 
[00:04:58]


(Howling) (Howling) (Howling) Chris, I think you put a little too much "Ah" in your "Awwoo." What are you talking about? That was 100% wolf howl. If I'm a wolf, I'm not singing that song. (Phone ringing) Man, I had a dream that some horrible howling zombies were circling the Tortuga. MARTIN: We were really howling. Oops. (Yawning) Where are you guys running off to so early in the morning, anyway? We're on a wolf run! Wolves are nature's best marathoners. They just run and run until they get what they're looking for. And we're looking for wolves by running like wolves! So you're doing a wolf marathon? Trying to catch up to the world's best long distance runner by... running? I think you'll be back before breakfast. Yeah, to "wolf down" some breakfast. That's the only wolf we'll be seeing this morning. (Laughing) Well, I've got a backup plan. Just in case we can't catch up or keep up. I've got the old trusty Plan B right here in my back pocket. Hmm. A moose suit? Uh, I don't know, Chris. How'd that work out for you with the gazelle suit and the cheetah? Whoa!! Ugh! (Groaning) She tackled me so fast. That was different. The cheetah's a sprinter. The wolf is a marathoner. With the wolf, I'd have time to deactivate. Wolf track! Definitely dog-like. Dog claws always show up in the tracks. Four toe pads, one heel pad. 6 inches from toe to heel, 4 inches wide. Definitely too big to be a fox or coyote. Oh yeah, it's definitely wolf! 
[00:07:00]


MARTIN: And more than one: A wolf pack! (Gasping) I'd say about five different wolves. What? What part of the track is telling you that? Three silver ones, two black ones... What? Where do you see that? And one white one! How in the world can you tell that from these tracks? Well actually, you kind of have to look at the big picture. Whoa! Now, that's a wolf pack! Well, who would've thunk it? Maybe the best way to find wolves is just to be out in the wild talking about wolves. Come in, Tortuga. This is Little Boy Who Cried Wolf calling Tortuga. Little Boy Who Cried Wolf telling you we found wolves. Forget it, Martin. Wolves on the move! Okay, check that. We're running with the wolves! (Cawing) And we're not the only ones! Ravens! Ravens are following them too! MARTIN: It helps to have wings to follow wolves because they have a fast pace, called a lope. A wolf can lope along all day long, covering 100 miles with hardly a rest. Now that's what I call a marathon. Hey, what do you call it when they pick up the pace even faster? More tiring? A chase! An all-out run. Hoohoo! They're after something. (Growling) (Pack howling) (Panting) Where do they get that kick? I know they can marathon all day and then sprint when they need to. (Rhythmic thudding) Do you hear a horse? Sounds bigger than a horse. Sounds like it has antlers. How can you tell that? From that moose charging towards us! 
[00:09:16]


(Screaming (Laughing) Oh, so that's what woke us up! Yeah, so much for sleeping in. Aw, Chris and Martin were screaming because they were being chased by the big bad moosie-woosie. That's right, moosie-woosie woosie-woosie woo. And when I looked at the screen, the moose was almost on top of you. A moose is on the loose! (Wolves growling) ?????? Ugh! Whoa! (Yelling) Whoa-- oof! Whoa! (Rattling) (Wolves growling) Uh-oh. JIMMY Z: Okay, so let me get this straight. So the wolf pack was starting to surround you-- Hey! Was he with the pack then? No. At 4 weeks, he's too young to go on the hunt. Well, he's attacking my controller! Come on, Jimmy. His teeth are just coming in. He's got to try them out on something. Well, all the adult wolf teeth were already in and I didn't want any of the big dogs trying those out on my moose behind. So I knew, before they closed the circle around me, I had to do something. MARTIN: Chris, deactivate! Get out of that moose suit! Whoa! Hooves don't work that way! MARTIN: Well then work them the way they work. Run! Sometimes these Creature Power suits are too... creature-y! But remember, a moose can't outrun a pack of wolves for long. You'll have to think of something else soon! ?????? 
[00:11:32]


(Panting) Can't run anymore. Think of something else. Antlers! Could they be the weapon against wolves? Antlers work on one wolf. Uh-oh. But not on a pack. Because moose only have antlers on one end. And wolves can surround a moose and attack from all ends. Ah-- Oh...but a moose can swim! Chris! Are you okay? (Ravens cawing) What are you doing? The moosie paddle! The moosie paddle? (Laughing) Good one, bro! The moosie paddle. Oh, come on, guys. Give me a little rest. Chris, while you cool off, I'll track the pack! Wait up! Oh no, moose hooves. How am I going to deactivate with moose hooves? KOKI: So where were you during all this... Little Howler? Well, if we keep following the trail of the story, you're going to pop up somewhere. How'd you get out of the moose suit, Chris? Well, it wasn't looking too good until I got a tip on a twig... From a moose! Well, look at that. A moose can grab and hold sticks with its lips. Deactivate! Back on wolf patrol! AVIVA: What was going on with you, Martin? MARTIN: Well, I had fallen way, way, way behind the wolves, and when I finally caught up with them, I discovered they had caught up with a moose. 
[00:13:37]


(Cawing) Whoo! Hey, guys. What did the wolf say to the ravens? Howl's it going? (Cawing) u like that, huh? (Cawing) What? I am not slow! I don't have wings. Must be nice to be a raven; at least you can fly. (Cawing) Oh, I get it: You warn the wolves if anyone approaches. (Cawing) And they take you to lunch. Smart. Wolves and Ravens make a great creature team. Oh, you've got to be kidding me. You wolves just ran 10 miles, pulled down a 2,000 lb. moose, devoured it, and now you're off and running again? Okay, I'm coming. (Whining) JIMMY Z: What were you whining about, Chris? CHRIS: Whining? Who was whining? I wasn't whining. (Whining) It's Little Howler. I think he's hungry. We'll need a special formula to feed him. I'll look it up in the database. (Whining) Hurry, Koki. He's breaking my heart. Oh. Pobrecito. Here it is: Wolf formula. I'll mix it up. Check it out. I'll cheer him up with a creature joke. Hey, Little Howler, what did one wolf puppy say to the other wolf puppy? Howl's it going? (Howling) (Laughing) Ugh, you've got to be kidding me. Wolf humor. It's funny! Howl ya doin? (Howling) I still don't know how you could ever have missed him out there. Well, it was one thing after another. Nature was really keeping us on our toes. Where did Little Howler come from? Well, after a lot more running... I followed the wolf pack to their den. And when I got there, they were all snoozing with full bellies. 
[00:15:42]


AVIVA: Did you see any puppies? MARTIN: No. There weren't any puppies around and the wolves were all lounging around, snoozing, and I just sat down to rest for a second and I guess I must've fallen asleep for a while because when I woke up, Chris was snarling at me like a cougar! Rowr! CHRIS: I wasn't snarling like a cougar. I was trying to wake you up and tell you. A cougar! A cougar! (Hissing) (Growling) (Roaring) CHRIS: Whoa. A never-before-seen face-off between a huge cougar-- Or you could call him mountain lion-- Or panther. Or catamount. We've got to film it. (Creaturepod beeping) All taken care of. The Creaturepod is recording. (Growling) (Cougar screaming) No wolf alone can defeat a cougar. But together they have the power of the pack. (Growling) ?????? (Growling) Hey, quit fighting my Creaturepod! (Laughing) He's gonna kill that Creaturepod. (Growling) Hey, Martin, didn't you say the Creaturepod was recording? (Gasping) Play it back! Maybe there's a clue. Okay, okay. Here, fight this monster. (Making growly noises) Got it. 
[00:17:48]


(Laughing) Fast-forward it. Stop! Do you see that? MARTIN: Yeah. It's... ALL: Little Howler! So that's when you got into my backpack! And now we know where he came from. Mystery solved! Yeah, there must have been a den hidden in those rocks. And a mother who's looking for him, too. All right. Now we've got a new Creature Mission. Yeah, we've got to figure out how to get Little Howler back home without a whole pack of wolves being mad at us for taking him in the first place. Okay, let's get going, then! JIMMY Z: Okay, we're at the coordinates. Yeah, a mile away from the den site sohe wolves won't be scared by a giant flying turtle. Here, take the wolf power discs, hot off the Creature Power press. Thanks, Aviva! Do they have marathon power? Oh, you'll be able to run, all right! And run and run and run and run. We are! But the door's not opening. Oh, yeah. I locked it for flying mode. CHRIS: Little Howler's mom must've been in the den. MARTIN: Maybe Little Howler has brothers and sisters in there, too. Yeah, the mother wolf will spend most of her time in the den with the ps for the first two months. Shh. The coast is clear. Great, we won't get into any trouble. The pack must be out hunting. I can't wa to see what's going on in there. Empty! There's no mother wolf. No pups. Why did they all leave? That's why. Because they knew that huge mountain lion had discovered their den site and was a danger to the pups. 
[00:19:52]


(Yipping) Uh-oh. Let's get out of here. Wait! Don't run. Right. She'll see us as prey. Nothing triggers a predator like prey on the run. (Growling) We need the power of the pack. Activate Wolf Powers. Nobody's gonna mess with us in our Wolf Power Suits. Tell that to the cougar! (Yipping) Thanks for the hair brushing. (Yipping) (Cougar screaming) We can't beat her in the short game for long. Switch to marathon running! On your mark, get set, go! CHRIS: She's tiring. A sprinter like her can't keep up the pace for long. Now we've got the cougar beat because we wolves are marathoners. Wow, I feel so light, like I could run like this forever. That's the power of the wolf! (Cawing) (Cawing) Amazing. We've only been wolves for two minutes and already a raven has found us. Well if he found us, he can find other wolves. And maybe lead us right to Little Howler's pack! (Howling) Follow that raven! Follow the wolf brothers following that raven! MARTIN: This is awesome. It's like I'Wolf Man and the raven is my sidekick. Maybe the raven thinks it's the other way around. But either way, because wolves and ravens are so tight, I don't think it'll be too long before this raven leads us right to the pack's new... den site! Uh-oh. We forgot to consider one very important point of wolf behavior. A wolf pack doesn't like strange wolves. Our only hope is to speak wolf language. Howl's it going? Bro, that accent won't do it. Well, what-- Sit! Roll over! Pet tricks? How're pet tricks gonna save us? Body language. Wolf body language. Yeah. By acting submissive, a wolf can turn off an attack from another wolf. If they recognize us as one of their own. And because we activated touching Little Howler, we smell familiar, like a pack member. We are in. Oh yeah. Chris! Martin! What about Little Howler!? 
[00:23:03]


(Howling) (Laughing) Now we're talking. (Howling) Howling: That's what wolves do to keep the pack together. With our little wolf puppy howling free and in the wild! (Howling) (Tortuga crew howling) Hey, it's me, Chris, again. And Martin, and here's someone else you know: Little Howler! Except she's a lot bigger. Look at her go! Two months older and ready to run. She's changed completely. She's huge! Wow, she used to be just this big and then in two months, boom! She's a big, romping 3-month-old wolf pup. Are you ready to run? Look out! Woohoo! Let's do it! Time to run with the wolf! (Martin laughing) She loves chasing. Whoa, she's speedy. CHRIS: I'm gonna catch you. Guess not. Yeah! (Laughing) MARTIN: Remember when Little Howler was just a puffball? She was just 4 weeks old, the age wolf pups first leave the den. Okay, you're gonna need a little help getting up there. Want to climb this mountain? There you go. There you go. You're almost at the top. You're almost-- you did it! Yeah! That was then. Now she's a long, sleek, running wolf who can get around on her own. 
[00:25:03]


CHRIS: Check it out. Her whole face has changed. She once had a short, round snout... and now it's long and pointed. Little Howler's 3 months old and a lot bigger but she's not strong enough yet to run with the pack on a long-distance, wolf-style marathon. She won't be ready for another few months. Then, she'll look like this: an adult-sized member of the wolf pack. And then she'll be able to keep up with the pack on their hunting missions. MARTIN: The wolf is a top predator of the North. That means everyone has to be on the lookout when a wolf pack is around-- small prey like porcupines and badgers... (Hissing) All the way up to huge animals like the moose which the wolves have to work together as a pack to catch. CHRIS: To learn how to hunt, a wolf pup runs and plays, but also has to get enough rest so she can grow up to run with the pack. MARTIN: We'll see you on the creature trail. A monitor lizard. A lot of lizards bask in the sun to warm up their body temperature so they can move. Lizards are cold-blooded. That means they don't have a constant body temperature like we do. So, they need the heat from their environment to warm them up. That's why a lot of reptiles bask in the warm sun every morning to get their bodies moving. Check this out, but you're going to have to look close because this is the smallest lizard in the world. He's just a little longer than my fingernail. This is a sphaero gecko that lives on islands in the Caribbean. Believe it or not, this is an adult. Can you imagine how small the babies are after they hatch out of an egg? And, each adult female sphaero lays one egg at a time. Nature is full of surprises. All right, time for another Wild KrattsCreature Quiz! You're on, Chris. All right! Is it a fish? No. Is it a mammal? Yes! Does it like the water? Uh, not really. But it likes moist, cool earth. Well, is it a good digger? Yeah! Does it have long claws? Oh, yeah. As long as my finger. Does it have a stripe down its face? How'd you know that? Yes, it does have a stripe down its face. Is it an American badger? Yes! An American badger! Ha-ha! Yes! I love these creatures. Hello? It's arthur!

Here's the homing device for tobey's tracking bracelet, the button to short out his electrical defense shield, the nullifier to neutralize his giant, attacking robots. What else? What else? What else? Wait. Giant, attacking robots? Ok. Got to go. Bye. [Door closes] gotcha! Oh. Hee hee! Ha ha ha! 
[00:02:13]


Narrator: Meanwhile in the botsford's front yard... Hmm, "enormo-grow, for truly enormous plants." [Rumbling] [growls] whoa. Hey there, big fella. Hmm, seems to be heading downtown. I better follow it. Why? Oh, uhh... School project? Hmm, ok. Have fun. Thanks, dad. Aww, big lug knocked over my watering can. Oh. Thank you. [All screaming] ok. Now, who wants to compete in the long jump? Excellent. Step up, boys. Ready, number 3? Ooh, gdistance but I have to take points off for the landing. Ok. Ready, number 8? Tobey, tobey, tobey. Wordgirl! Hey...'Sup? Um, what are you doing? You know, just hangin'. Any chance you can "hang" without crashing your enormous robots into buildings? No. Of course not. Well, have fun rebuilding them. Wordgirl, wordgirl, wordgirl, did you really think I'd make a special trip to the city with just 3 robots? Oh, boy. How many do you think you can take? Huggy. [Beep] [screeches] so, wordgirl, what would you like to see next, a relay race or robot hopscotch? Neither, tobey, because I happen to know your weakness, and her name is mommy. Prepare to go to your room. You have me on speed dial? Yeah. That's cool. Hey, if you ever want to go out for ice cream or-- it's strictly for business purposes. Right. Right. 
[00:04:17]


[Dials] hello? Hi, uh... Mrs. Macallister? She's away on business. Can I take a message? Actually tobey is wrecking the city with a bunch of robots, so-- uh, sure, he is. How can he be wrecking the city when he's sitting right here? I don't the answer to that, but--- wait. What? He's only, like, the best kid I ever baby-sat. No. He's destroying the city. Talk to you later. No, no, no, no, no, no, no. Good-bye. Oh, do you believe the weirdos in this world? Now, where were we? Oh, right. Kayla called zach, even though I told her I totally like him, and, like, kayla is supposed to be my best friend, and she totally went behind my back. I told her we are so not friends anymore. Do you think I did the right thing? Oh, thank you. You are such a good listener. So, did you have a nice, little conversation with the babysitter? Ha ha ha! Huggy, activate emergency plan number 67. I'll stall for time. Oo oo oo. No. That's 54. Oo oo. No. That's 113. [Screeches] no. Tha-- just go talk to the babysitter. So, wordgirl, what now, hmm? Actually, I'm not sure. I've never faced an enormous army of robots before. Ohh, "enormous." What a painfully ordinary word. I mean, you are wordgirl, aren't you? Couldn't you come up with a better word for "big," like "massive" or "gigantic" or, ooh, "gargantuan." Listen. I'm not going to stand here and bicker with you about words. "Bicker," hmm? What about "tussle"? "Tussle" is good. I like "brawl." Stop. Stop. Stop! "Stop" is such an easy word. What about "cease"? Ok. Cease... Or the rest of my robots will tear this city apart, hmm? Fine. I halted. You think you're so smart, don't you, with your super powers, and your vocabulary, and ur luminous smile? What? But you can be beaten, just like everyone else. I'm going to prove that I'm smarter than you, and then you'll be mine, all mine. What do you mean by I'll be all yours? Oh, uh, nothing. Never mind. Have you ever seen the game show "cash or pie"? Yeah. Well, now it's time to play "crash or pie." Hee hee hee! Ha ha ha! Ha ha! Ahem. 
[00:06:28]


[Robots laugh] yes. Thank you. I know. If I win, you have to sit and watch as my robots destroy the city. Also, I promised a friend that I'd get a photo of you signed, "tobey, all my love, wordgirl." Uh, his name is tobey, too. Anyway, if I lose, which isn't likely, I'll shut down my robots, but I still need the photo. Deal? Do I have choice? Not really. Hurry up, huggy. [Beeping] [doorbell rings] hello? Oh, wow! An aardvark in tights. [Screeches] are you trying to tell me something? Oh. Maybe tobey is good at charades. He is such a good listener. You know, I've been talking to him for a couple of hours. I know it's hard to believe because I am so shy, but he's so easy to talk to. He's just, like, one of those people. You're just "blah, blah, blah, blah," and 5 hours later, you realize you've been talking that long, you know? Narrator: Welcome, folks, to the first-ever showing of, uh-- "crash or pie." Narrator: Crash or pie. Now introducing our contestants... From the suburbs, he's a 10-year-old genius who enjoys wreaking havoc with his robots, and also has a secret crush on wordgirl. Hey! Let's welcome theodore tobey macallister. [Clanking] yes. Thank you. Save it for the end. Narrator: And from the planet lexicon, she's a pint-sized powerhouse who enjoys reading, decorating her doll house, and pulverizing those who stand in the way of justice. Let's welcome wordgirl. [Applause] yeah. Hello. Uh, no secret crushes? Narrator: As a matter of fact, she does, but I'm not allowed to say. But you revealed mine. Narrator: Yeah, but it's her show. Just start the game. Narrator: Fine. Here are the rules. I'll say a word. The first person to hit the buzzer and give another word that means the same thing as that word gets a point. Understand? Comprehend. Narrator: Correct. Hey, the game hasn't started. Narrator: Excuse me, but I'm the host. I'll say when the game has started. Commenced. Narrator: Correct. Hey! Narrator: Ok. Wordgirl has jumped out to an early lead. Let's see if she can keep it. Ready? Prepared. Narrator: Oh, I'm sorry tobey. We weren't playing yet. That's embarrassing. Ha ha ha! Ok.

WET. Narrator: Correct. Hold on a sec. You're cheating. I am not. Yes, you are. You're using your super speed to buzz in before I can. No, I'm not. I'm just smarter than you. Is that so? Well, if that's how you want to play... Narrator: The next word is... Hey! "Admire." Tobey: Ahem. "Like." Narrator: Correct. No fair. You cheated. It was an accident. My finger slipped. Narrator: Next word is "finish." Whoopsy. Hey! "END." Narrator: CORRECT. What's taking huggy so long? Are you having as hard a time understanding him as I am? If tobey can't understand you, then nobody can. He's, like, the best kid I ever baby-sitted, and I've baby-sitted them all. Wait. Is it "baby-sitted" or "baby-sat"? I can never remember. Anyway, like I was saying, I have baby-sat so many kids since I started doing this, and he's the beskid ever. He's so quiet, I don't think he's even said two words since I've been here. It so funny his mom even thinks that I need this. I don't even know what it does, something about robots, but, I mean, how silly. How could anyone possibhink--hey! Ooh! Why, you little-- Narrator: Well, after a strong rally by tobey... And a healthy dose of cheating... Narrator: We're tied at 6. Time for the lightning round. You each take a turn giving me a synonym for the lightning word. The first person to give a wrong word loses. We start with wordgirl. Are you ready? Oh, yeah. Bring it. Narrator: Ok. Here we go. The lightning word is "enormous." "Big." "Large." "Jumbo." "Huge." "Gargantuan." "Massive." "Mammoth." "Giant." "Gigantic." Uh, "unsmall." What? "Unsmall." That's not a word. Is too. Is not. Is too. Is not. Is too. IS NOT! Narrator: Whoa! Stop. When there's an argument, it's up to the judge to decide who's right. Oh, fine. Fine. Narrator: The fate of the city hangs in the balance. What will the brilliant and handsome judge decide? Oh, brother. 
[00:10:38]


Narrator: Will he side with wordgirl and save the city, or will he side with tobey and watch it be destroyed? Stay tuned and find out. Um, what was the argument about again? Well, the original word was "enormous," and tobey's answer was "unsmall." Narrator: Oh, that's not a word. Wordgirl wins. Ha! Well, tobey, looks like it's time to shut down your "unsmall" friends. Oh, I'm sorry. I forgot to tell you something. Hey! I'm a very sore loser. Ha ha ha! What did you do? I have no idea. [Huggy whistles] great job, huggy. Tobey: Give me that. Would you get-- banana-loving-- aha! [Beep beep] ohh, boy. Ahem. Uh, hi, mom. You look great. Did you have a nice trip? What? Oh, these. These aren't mine. I was just out for a walk, minding my own business. Ahem. Ok. These are mine, but I wasn't going to-- oh, forget it. Ow. Ow. Ow! Narrator: And so, the city is safe once again, all thanks to wordgirl... Oh, and captain huggy face. I should probably mention the baby-sitter. She helped out, too, and tobey's mom. Hey, come on. Wrap it up. Narrator: Fine. Sorry. You, too, huggy. Narrator: Join us again next time for "the amazing colossal adventures of wordgirl"... Oh, and thanks for playing "crash or pie." Good night. ?????? Wordgirl ?????? hello. I'm beau handsome, and this is... All: "May I have a word?" As usual, the player who correctly defines today's featured word will win a fabulous prize. Let's play... All: "May I have a word?" Yes, you may. Today's featured word is "hurl." To give you a clue, here are some clips from "wordgirl" that show the correct meaning of the word. Oh, butcher, will you never learn that your meat attacks are no match for wordgirl? She's invincible. Ok, but who can define the word? "Invincible" means can't be destroyed by anything, unbeatable. Well, yes, emily. That's correct, but that's not the definition we're looking for. The butcher-- what a totally lame opponent for wordgirl. And he calls himself a villain? No, emily. You can't define "villain," either. The featured word is "hurl." Any guesses? Yes, tommy? "Hurl" means to throw or fling, like the butcher does with his lame meat. Yes! Congratulations, tommy. You are today's winner. Huggy, show him what he's won. An official wordgirl 10-foot paperclip. 
[00:13:40]


All: Ooh! Hey, that prize is as lame as the butcher. See you next time on... All: "May I have a word?" ?????? Wordgirl ?????? Narrator: Just another carefree day in the city, as todd "scoops" ming shares his childhood dreams with becky "wordgirl" botsford. Someday I'm going to work for the top newspaper in the country, a paper that's super, um-- impressive? Right. Impressive. Today roving writer for "the daily rag," tomorrow ace reporter for "the big city times." Wow. Hey, did you read today's paper? Yes. I, um, meant to mention the layout and, um, the headlines. Are you using new lettering? You hated it. "Hate" is such a strong word... Accurate but strong. See, I found it a little, well, dull. Dull? Dull in a good way. "Second street traffic light fixed." "New carpeting in teachers' lounge." You call that dull? Ha! Um, yeah. Scoops, you've got to run stories more interesting to fifth graders. I mean, "second main bank announces free toaster day"? Becky, I have to think of our subscribers. Who reads "the daily rag" outside of elementary school? "Bank gives away free toasters." Really? "Free toasters." Hey, this paper is right. Man: Psst. Hey. Hey, buddy. Buddy. "Free bobelcue outside"? Yeah. Free bobelcue in the parking lot. Come on. Bobelcue. Sorry. Bank rules. I can't leave my post for-- wait. What's a bobelcue? You know, bobelcue. Bobelcue? Bobelcue! Maybe he mkans curlicue. Or katmandu. How about peekaboo? I see you. No. Bobelcue. Bobelcue sauce? Here. Oh, barbecue. Why didn't you say so? Ohh! Mm! Hey, everybody, free barbecue outside. Woman: Look, pal. I'm asking you nicely, get your filthy fingers off of my drumstick. Your drumstick? I grabbed it first. The rule is, ladies first. 
[00:15:43]


Narrator: Meanwhile, a mysterious man sneaks into the second main bank. Mine! Ugh! Mine! You know, it's awfully nice of the bank to throw their loyal customers a free barbecue. The bank didn't throw this. We thought you customers did. Wait. If you didn't throw this barbecue... And the bank didn't throw this barbecue. Then, who? [Alarm siren] whoopsie. [Alarm siren] hey, an alarm. Really? I don't hear anything. Man: Second main bank has been robbed. Holy cow, the second main bank has been robbed. Now, that's an impressive story. Scoops, you'd better hustle. What do you have, super hearing or something? Um, no, of course not. I'd have to be wordgirl to have super hearing, which I'm certainly not and don't, um-- race you to the bank for a free toaster. Oh! You're on. Bob, we're not actually racing him. I was creating a diversion. Come on. We've got to work to do. Word up. Hmm... Just as I suspected-- barbecue sauce. Wordgirl, you just missed him. I was afraid of that. Whatappened? It was business as usual, and then some guy handed me a flier about a free bobblecue outside. BOBBLECUE? Woman: He meant barbecue. Guard: And then he robbed the bank while we were out eating. I see. So, the barbecue was just a diversion to get everyone out of the bank. Right. What's a diversion? Diversion. It's a way to distract people, get them to look someplace else, like over there. What? Where? Oh, I see. Wordgirl, who do you think did this? Hmm, a barbecue bank robbery? I have some ideas. Where do you think he'll strike next? Um, I'm not sure. What do you mean, you're not sure? That I'm not sure. What's your secret identity? Nice try. Eh. Nice doggy. 
[00:17:45]


Narrator: Meanwhile at ye olde fancy schmancy jewelry shop... "Barbecue bank robbery." "City janitors use new window cleaner." Ah, here it is. "Rich old lady to buy the impressive hoboken diamond." Here I am, reginald. Positively delighted to see you, dear, and here's the hoboken diamond. Ahh... Impressive, isn't it? Oh, yes. A gem for a gem. Oh, you. I hope you don't mind if I pay in pocket change. Of course, I have very deep pockets. [Both laugh] oh, how I love your money. Oh, reginald, I just love being filthy rich and buying only the most expensive, overpriced things. I love that you're filthy rich, as well. Free barbecue. Free? Whoo hoo! Free free free free free! Ooh, somebody is hungry. Boy, what an impressive story. "Barbecue bank robber fills up on millions while guard chows down on ribs." Yeah. That's some story. "Employees and customers eat the evidence." Um, don't you think you twisted things a little. "Wordgirl and captain huggy face clueless." Hey! We weren't-- um, I mean, I doubt if they were clueless. Oh, you're right. Probably should have used "baffled," maybe "dazed." "Dumfounded"? Bob, where are you going? Oh, you vile, little rodent. Off. Off! Buy your own free barbecue. Hey, this is just what happened yesterday. A thief used free barbecue as a diversion, then robbed the bank. Excuse me, blandly dressed little girl, but I am far too smart to fall for that. [Alarm bell] oh, dear. Yes! Another major scoop. Becky, did you hear? Someone robbed the jewelry store. Score! Becky. Becky? 
[00:19:45]


Becky: Word up. Hold it right there, butcher. Ah, wordgirl. Finally, we meet for the third time. Um... Help! That brute has his grubby paws all over my diamond. So, butcher, thought you could steal the hoboken diamond, eh? Well this time, your diversion failed. "Diversion"? You mean "barbecue." Kind of. Your barbecue was a diversion. But I didn't serve any diversion at my barbecue, only ribs and chicken with that sticky red sauce. No. I mean you used the barbecue as a way to distract people from the crime you were committing. They went outside to eat barbecue. You went inside to rob them. Huh? Let's try this. Your shoe is untied. It is? Thank you. Hey, wait a minute. I don't have any shoelaces. You were just tricking me. Yes. I created a diversion. While you looked at your shoe, I blocked your escape route. Oh, diversion. I get it. Thanks, wordgirl. Happy to help. Don't get too happy. Pot roast attack! Lady: Why, that horrible man has gone off with my diamond. Ohh! Scoops: Wordgirl, who do you think is behind this? Um, thbutcher. You were here, remember? Right. Where do you think he'll strike next? I'm not sure. Then you'll tell me your secret id-- give it up, already. Fine. Don't tell me. Still, you have to admit, my reporter's instincts are pretty impressive. What do you mean? Well, first I wrote about the bank. Then it got robbed. Then I wrote about the jewelry store, and then it got robbed. It's like every story I write about turns into a crime scene. Ha ha ha! Ha ha! Why isn't anyone laughing? That's it. Don't you see? The butcher is using your stories to plot out his crimes. Really? You mean, the butcher reads "the daily rag"? Listen, scoops. I've got a story for you. Now you're talking. Your secret identity is-- the monkey's secret identity? Ok. So far, I'm not impressed. Look. Just trust me on this, ok? Ok. My barbecue plan is geniosity. No, wait. Geni-- it's really smart. Huh, I wonder what I should steal next. Wow, good timing. "Vic's vegetarian restaurant makes millions off wheat and barley ice cream." Hmm, I'm scheming. Hey, guys, tofu. Yeah. Hey, everybody, free barbecue outside. Come get it while it's hot. Uh, I said, free barbecue, tons of free food. Come on. Thanks, buddy, but I've already got food. Where? Right here--tofu. 
[00:22:26]


Man: Haven't you ever seen tofu before? I don't see anything but some squishy-looking white stuff. Yeah. Tofu-- you know, delicious soybean curd. Here. Try some. No, thanks. It looks like my stomach. See? Woah, no. Stop. You're ruining my appetite. Oh, well, I'll bring it back for you. That looks like... Meat. Uh, yeah. We don't eat meat. We're vegetarians. What does that have to do with not eating meat? It's all over now, butcher. Hey, did you know these people here don't eat meat? Yes. That's what "vegetarian" means. That's sick. You're not going to get away this time, butcher. Oh, yeah? Sausage cyclone! [Screeches] can't...See. Sausages....Everywhere. Huggy, help! Man: Hey! That's my tofu. Ack! Ack! What happened? Sausage cyclone! Uh, I said, sausage cyclone! What's in this stuff? Man: Delicious soybean curd, coagulant. Huggy, I think tofu blocks the butcher's power. Ugh... Sausage cycl-- hit him again, huggy. Hit him again. Ok, huggy. That's enough. Ok. I'm down already, all right? Stop. Stop! Wow, now that was impressive. It was? I mean, thank you. Thank you. This is going to be the most incredible story I've ever written. Really? Yeah. Daring barbeque bandit foiled by brave, quick-thinking, charming... He called me charming. Ace reporter todd "scoops" ming. Oh, um, right. Wow, I'm a hero. Narrator: So, chalk up another impressive victory for wordgirl and captain huggy face, all thanks to the power of the press... And the power of tofu. You owe me money for the tofu, dude. Yeah. Oo oo oo oo. 
[00:24:33]


Narrator: Um, sorry, buddy. I'd lend you the cash, but i, um, left my wallet at home. Guess you're on your own. Tune in next time for another exciting episode of "wordgirl." ?????? Wordgirl ?????? hello. I'm beau handsome, and this is the bonus round of... All: "May I have a word?" Tommy, you correctly defined the word "hurl." Ready to play the bonus round? Bring it. Great. Take a look at these 3 pictures and tell me which one shows the definition for "hurl." [Music playing] ok, tommy. Got an answer? Tj is demonstrating a classic hurl, similar to the butcher's hurling meat attacks. Number 1. You are correct. You've won the bonus round, tommy. Huggy, show him his special prize. Aw, man, that's lamer than the paperclip. Indeed, it is. See you next time on... All: "May I have a word?" Narrator: Fighting crime one word at a time. Diversion. It's a way to distract people.

It's a beautiful world ?????? ?????? Word World.?????? KIDS: Yay! NARRATOR: It was a beautiful day in Word World. And Frog was working in his garden. KIDS: Rose! (chuckles) What a lovely r-r-rose. (sniffs) Ribbit... (gasps) What was that? Hmm, r-ock. What's this rock doing here? Hmm, well, I certainly can't have a rock in my garden. 
[00:02:01]


NARRATOR: The rock landed right in front of Sheep, (humming tune) who was very good at playing pretend. I'm pretending to be a princess. Oh. (gasps) A ruby. I can't believe it. A ruby just dropped out of the sky. Uh, pardon me, Sheep, but I happen to be something of a ruby expert, and that's not a ruby. That's a rock. A ruby is a very valuable red stone. And a rock is-- well, just a rock. Oh, well, I know that, Frog. I'm pretending this rock is a ruby. Pretending? Why, playing pretend is the most wonderful, fantastic fun thing ever. When we pretend, we can do anything. Anything? (gasps) Don't tell me you've never played pretend before? Not really, no. I don't know how to play pretend. Then you've come to the right WordFriend. Follow m and you'll be a great pretender in no time. Ribbit. Really? How? Stay right there. I'll show you. We'll go on a pretend adventure to find a really red ruby. And we'll use these letter "R"s. Ribbit. Why the letter "R"? Because the letter "R" makes the "ruh" sound. Like in really red ruby. So... readyto play pretend? Ribbit. Ready. First we have to ride a really round rug. A really round rug? Then we have to cross a rushing river. A rushing river? Then we have to climb to the top of a rocky ridge. A rocky ridge?! We get to do all that to find the really red ruby? Yep. (giggles) Isn't pretending fun? Okay, "rug" starts with the letter "R." Now, all we need... is a "U" and a "G." "R-u-g." R-ug. 
[00:04:51]


KIDS: Rug! Ta-da! One really round rug. Let's ride it to find the really red ruby. Uh, how are we going to ride a rug? Um, remember, Frog, we're pretending. SHEEP: Whoo! Whoo. Whoo, whee! Sheep, you know I'm not really riding a flying rug. But I am having fun. You're doing great, Frog. Keep pretending. Okay. Uh, whoosh, whoosh. Wow, this round rug sure flies fast. Whoo. Whee. (laughing) It sure does. BOTH: ?????? Isn't this cool, isn't this groovy? ?????? ?????? We're off to find the really red ruby ?????? ?????? Feels like a dream, like we're in a movie ?????? ?????? We're pretending all the way. ?????? NARRATOR: Pretending to ride on a flying rug, Frog and Sheep went down the road looking for the really red ruby. SHEEP: Here we are at the rushing river. Uh, Sheep, this isn't a rushing river. It's just a stream. Frog, remember, we're only pretending. Oh, right, pretending. Oh, no. How ever will we get across the rushing river? Never fear, Frog, I have a plan. First, we need a letter "R." Then we need the letters "A," "F" and "T." R-a-f-t. R-aft. 
[00:06:53]


KIDS: Raft! This rubber raft will take us to where we'll find... The really red ruby? Right. Come on, Frog, climb in so we can go down the rushing river. Let's go! Whoa, whoo, whee! Watch out for those rocks, Frog. Ooh, no. The water is going faster and faster. Oh, great pretending, Frog. (giggles) (gasps) Oh, look, there's a waterfall up ahead. Waterfall? Oh, a pretend waterfall. Oh, no! I think we better... jump! (both laughing) Oh, that sure was a lot of fun. Ribbit. You're getting good at playing pretend, Frog. Come on, we're off to find the really red ruby. Whoo-hoo! Ribbit. BOTH: ?????? Isn't this cool, isn't this groovy? ?????? ?????? We're off to find the really red ruby ?????? ?????? Feels like a dream, like we're in a movie ?????? ?????? We're pretending all the way. ?????? NARRATOR: Finally Sheep and Frog arrived at their destination. Here we are. The rocky ridge. This hill doesn't look very dangerous or rocky. So we'll pretend that it is. (clearing throat) In all of my adventures, I've never seen such a tall, dangerous and rocky ridge. However can we climb it? Lucky for us, I have just the thing. And it starts with the letter "R." R-o-p-e. R-ope. 
[00:09:08]


KIDS: Rope! We can climb the rope all the way to the top of the rocky ridge. (grunting) NARRATOR: So Sheep and Frog pretended that they were climbing up the side of a tall mountain ridge. This is so steep, so dangerous. And so much fun. (strained grunting) Ah, we made it! Whoo-hoo! Sheep, we rode the round rug and the rushing river and scaled to the top of the rocky ridge. But there's no red ruby here. Don't worry, Frog. I have all these letters in my bag. We can build a ruby. "Ruby" starts with the letter "R." Now for the rest of the letters we need to build a ruby. Oh, no. We can't build a ruby with the letters "O-C-K." Hmm, no. But we can build a rock. A rock? Yes, a rock. Sheep, a rock isn't the same as a ruby. Yes, that's true, Frog, but remember, we're pretending. Oh... And when you pretend, a rock can be a ruby. Right. Now all we have to do is... BOTH: Build a word. ?????? It's time to build a word ?????? ?????? Let's build it, let's build it now. ?????? "R-o-c-k." R-ock. 
[00:11:16]


KIDS: Rock! ?????? Yeah, we just built a word ?????? ?????? We built it, we built it. ?????? Look, Sheep, we built a rock, but we can pretend it's the really... red... BOTH: ruby! I knew you could do it, Frog. Ribbit. And... (clearing throat) thank you, Sheep, for teaching me how to play pretend. I never knew it could be so much fun. Stick with me, Frog. This is just the beginning. And there are so many other things we can pretend to be with the letter "R." Like race car racers. (imitates engine revving) (laughing) Hey, wait for me. NARRATOR: So thanks to Sheep, Frog learned that a pretend adventure can r-r-really be the best kind of adventure of all. The end. KIDS: Pig! Bonjour, WordFriends. Come and help me make Pig's perfect pizza. ?????? Making pizza is an art, but the most important part ?????? ?????? Is the toppings and you'll see ?????? ?????? All my favorites start with "P" ?????? ?????? First I find the letter "P" ?????? ?????? It makes the sound "puh," you see ?????? ?????? Add the "puh" sound to an "ickle" ?????? You're making pizza with a pickle? ?????? The perfect pizza this will be ?????? ?????? Using words that start with "P" ?????? ?????? Here I have another "P" ?????? ?????? I wonder what it's gonna be ?????? ?????? It's not a parsnip or a prune ?????? ?????? What is it? ?????? ?????? You'll find out soon ?????? ?????? You put the "puh" sound with an "umpkin" ?????? You're making pizza with a pumpkin? ?????? The perfect pizza this will be ?????? ?????? Using words that start with "P" ?????? ?????? Yup-a-diddly, yup-a-diddly ?????? ?????? Making pizza is so fun ?????? ?????? Wait a second, you're not done? ?????? 
[00:13:24]


PIG: What? No way. (giggles) ?????? I'll add some popcorn, plums and peas ?????? ?????? And some pasta, if you please ?????? ?????? A pear, a peach, pancakes and pie ?????? ?????? That pizza reaches to the sky ?????? ?????? The perfe pizza this will be ?????? ?????? Using words that start with "P." ?????? Hmm, just one more topping. No, Pig, you have enough. A peanut! (laughing) Whoa... whoa... Whoa...! (gasps) I broke the pizza. Oh, what are we going to do now? Hmm, there's only one way to solve this pizza predicament. It's time to... ALL: Build a word! ?????? It's time to build a word ?????? ?????? Let's build it, let's build it now. ?????? P-i-z-z-a. KIDS: Pizza! ?????? Yeah, we just built a word ?????? ?????? We built it, we built it. ??????

KIDS: Word World! (croaks) (whimpers) (giggles) ?????? Welcome to our world ?????? KIDS: Word World! ?????? Word World?????? KIDS: Word World! ?????? It's a beautiful world ?????? ?????? Word World.?????? KIDS: Yay! NARRATOR: On this beautiful spring morning in Word World, Frog was building a fire truck with Duck and Fly. Ribbit. I still need the letter "F," Duck. (humming tune) Here you go, Frog, the letter "F." Quack, quack. Great. The letter "F" makes the "fa" sound. Now we have all the letters we need to build a fire truck. KIDS: Fire truck! (horn honking) Quack, quack. Wow, cool. Let's look inside. Yeah. (gasps) Wow! That's a cool hat, Duck. (grunting) That's my fire hat, Duck. It's what firefighters wear. What's a firefighter? A firefighter is someone who puts out dangerous fires. Ooh! Ooh! BOTH: Can we be firefighters? Well... Oh, please, oh, please, oh, please? Quack, quack. We'll be the best firefighters ever, I promise. Well... sure you can. Here's one for you, Fly, and here's one for you, Duck. Cool! We're firefighters! Yeah! Ribbit. Well, you're not official firefighters yet. To get your badge and become Firefighter Duck and Firefighter Fly, you need to learn everything about fires. Especially how to put them out. Ribbit. "F-i-r-e. The letter "F" makes the "fa" sound in "fire." F-ire. 
[00:18:02]


KIDS: Fire! Fires are very hot. They can help you stay warm. But when fires get too big, they are very dangerous. Oh. Oh. How do we find dangerous fires? Fires make smoke. So where there's smoke, there's fire. BOTH: Right. Where there's smoke, there's fire. And it's up to you, junior firefighters, to find and put the fires out. Then you'll get your badge. So we need to look out for any signs of a fire. Correct. You can use my telescope to look for any signs of a fire. And I'll stay here and get the fire truck ready. Yes. sir. Yes, sir. DUCK: See any smoke, Fly? FLY: Not yet. How about now? Nope. Let me take a look. umming tune) (gasps) That looks like smoke behind the hill! And Frog said, "Where there's smoke..." "There's fire." (gasps) That must be a fire. Quack, quack. Quick, let's tell Frog. Quack, quack. (Fly yells) Frog... (gasping) Frog! What's wrong, Duck? Quack, quack. I found a fire! (gasps) A fire? Where? Over there. Yeah, over there. I saw smoke coming from behind that hill. So there must be a fire there. We have to go put it out. Follow me! (grunting) Right. Following you.

There was smoke coming out of the train. So I, Firefighter Duck, put out the fire. Quack, quack. Um, Duck, the train wasn't on fire. It wasn't? That was steam coming out of the train... (steam hissing) ...not smoke. Steam looks like smoke, but it's different. So no smoke... No fire... BOTH: No badge! NARRATOR: So Duck and Fly returned to their lookout spot in Frog's log. FLY: See anything? FROG: No. Oh. How about now? No. Now? No. Now? Fly! Oh. Um, now? Fly! Quack, quack. Sorry. I just really want to be Firefighter Fly. Well, you just have to be patient. Quack. (sighs) Oh, look, it's the lighthouse. And it's covered in smoke! Oh, no! Quack, quack. The lighthouse must be on fire! Come on! We got to tell Frog! Frog! Frog, I found a fire! Are you sure, Duck? Yeah, the lighthouse is covered in smoke. It's gotta be a fire this time. Ribbit. Into the fire truck, firefighters! ALL: Firefighters to the rescue!

FLY: It isn't? Are you sure, Frog? I mean, look at all of that smoke. FROG: That's not smoke. That's f-og. Fog. So, again, no smoke... No fire... BOTH: No badge! Um, you want to look, Duck? No. Um, are you sure? Yes. Quack, quack. (sadly): We're never going to get our badges and become real firefighters. Oh! (sobbing) Quack, quack, quack! (blows nose) Oh...

You're right! There's "S-M-O-K-E." Smoke rising from the forest! And where's there's smoke... There's fire. Great job, Fly. Now we'll finally get our badges and get to be firefighters. Come on! We have to tell Frog! Quack, quack. (Duck panting) Frog! Frog, there's a fire in the forest! A forest fire? Are you sure? Yeah, it's not steam or fog. It's definitely smoke. Everyone in the truck quick!

ALL: Firefighters to the rescue! (bell clanging) PIG: Fire! Fire! (blowing air) Oh, help! Save my marshmallows! (bell clanging, tires screech) BOTH: Firefighters to the rescue! Great job!

Ooh, you saved my marshmallows! Mmm! Yum! (chuckles) That's what we do. We're firefighters. (barks) Mm-hmm. But now how are we going to roast marshmallows without a fire? (clears throat) I think our new firefighters can help. What? Oh, yeah! The letter "F" makes the "fa" sound in f-ire. Fire! We can use the letter "F" to make a new fire. All we have to do is...

=======================================================

Warnings and thunderstorm warnings are up across the region. Your world with neil cavuto begins right now. 
>> Neil: Thank you, shepard. To the left of your screen you're looking at what is an almost unrecognizably foggy, out of focus shot of dallas texas. Right now, dallas, the ninth largest city in the country, is under tornado watch. It has been in effect now for the better part of an hour and a half. And you can see from the greater dallas region, we're going to get to janice in a second on this but anything marked in red shows a tornado watch in effect. We already have thunderstorm warnings in effect. That is serious thunderstorms have been reported in the area. Of course, this is ripe for more tornado activity. It's getting a great deal of attention. Welcome, you're watching your world and mother nature front and center again as it was 24 hours ago to janice in the fox weather center on a much more populated target today. 
>> Neil, tornado watch for dallas, under a severe thunderstorm warning right now, and that could be upgraded to tornado warning. We have wind gusts in excess of 48 miles-per-hour and just in a matter of 14 minutes the temperature dropped from 81 to 65. That tells you the front is moving through and the potential for volatile weather, we have a lot of cloud to ground lightning in and around the dallas area, i suspect that the dallas airport is probably on delay in a lot of flights are being held right now at the airport. So just to give you a look, toward watch is in effect for part office texas, through louisiana, up towards arkansas, and gnaw tornado watch now stretching into portions of mississippi, alabama, up towards memphis, tennessee. Severe thunderstorm warning in and around the dallas area. We're watching these cells line up here. This radar imagery is showing me the potential for straightline winds. When you see the cell jump out we have the danger of super cells about right now mainly straightline winds. And that could cause severe damage as well. So certainly under the gun for dallas. Texarkana under a tornado warning. No warnings just yet. But we'll keep you up to date. Look at how wide reaching this severe threa is. From the northeast corridor, all the way through the ohio river valley, down into central parts of texas, with that red area, neil, all of the ingreeds coming together for the potential for not only hail, damaging winds, heavy rainfall, and the potential for tornadoes as well for all of these big cities south of little rock and dallas. We'll keep a very close eye on this. Forecasts, dallas over the next hour or so really monitoring you as this line continues to press eastward and southward over loiana, parts of arkansas, then into the tennessee river valley and the mississippi river valley. Things will dissipate. That's the good news. Still seeing a chance of thunderstorms in the forecast for parts of oklahoma where we had the devastating tornado but you can see the very warm, moist, unstable air mass head of the front. 62 in dallas and just moments AGO WE WERE IN THE 80s. Back to you. 
[00:03:35]



>> Neil: Amazing. I have been counting, 38 counties in that area in and around 
-- not just texas 
-- are under this tornado watch, and the greater dallas area, dallas county, all under this tornado watch in an area that crises some two and a half million people. Cal is in the ninth largest city in the united states and spread out 385 square miles. Severe thunderstorm warnings have already been issued and to janice's point, that often times 
-- not all the time but can be a precursor to more serious stuff as if they weren't more serious. Here's what they're worried about in the greater dallas area. That it turns into another moore, oklahoma area, or could, that's where you'll fine casey stegall. 
>> If there is some good news here it's that the severe storms we were experience here in moore today, a few hours ago, seem to have subsided. Now hearts and thoughts and prayers with the folks in texas as they're potentially under the gun now. Just while dan 
-- janice deep was talking we had an active situation in moore. Devastated by at least an ef4 tornado yesterday. And there was search and rescue effort going on in this house. They don't spend much time on each house base they're working with dogs. I'll keep my eyes peeled and see if we can spot one of them. They're k-9 units and you have two different kinds of dogs. One that is trained to detect alive human beings that may be trapped and then there's a second type of k-9 unit that is a cadaver dog, and it is designed and trained to hit on, if you will, people that did not survive, that could potentially be trapped under the rubble, and what you'll see ills the dogs 
-- see is the dogs will go through and they'll bark. That's a hit, they'll bark if they see or smell, detect, something under the human eye can't see. They're also going through with thermal imaging cameras so they can look for b warmth if in fact perhaps there is someone trapped, and you can't physically see them because in some instances the piles of rubble-five, six, seven feet 
-- feet tall. When this swept through yesterday it was an average monday afternoon here in oklahoma, and it did give some d of warning. 16 minutes people had to take cover and the people who made it now made it alive did not necessarily know if that would have been the outcome. Listen to this woman. 
[00:06:22]



>> I was praying to god and i was like, I'm not going to see tomorrow. I was just like 
-- I don't want to die today, but there's nothing else to do. 
>> We know that 24 lost their lives yesterday. That is the word from the medical examiner's office. We haven't seen that number change sense this morning. So, certainly fingers are crossed there are no other fatilities discovered under the rubble. A strong number but one that could have been higher when you stand in areas like this and you see the devastation. 
>> Neil: Amazing. Thank you very much. Want to take you back to dallas, texas. All counties in and around dallas are now under a tornado watch and severe thunderstorm warning. To the left a very foggy, impossible to make out shot of the greater city of dallas. All of the counties under the toward watch right now. That means there is a distinct threat of a tornado occurring there. A warning of severe thunderstorms, they have already head those. Showing you the conundrum that's can cause, the dallas independent school district did not release students early because of the severe weather already in effect, and the high winds already reported at dallas-fort worth international airport. Winds in excess of 50-miles-an-hour, and as a result they were between a rock and a hard place in the dallas area school district, keeping kids in the schools because the better part of valor was not endanger them by releasing them. So at this time, schools havele let out, but we're told that many are still sort of in those facilities. We want to remind dallas, texas, area viewers watching to take the usual precautions as authorities say to seek a safe place, basement, get into an interior room, a middle room in your home if none is available. All the provisoses they were talking about 24 hours nothing the greater oklahoma city area. Meanwhile, take a look at this. The path of yesterday's tornado in oklahoma, which is almost identical to ago killer twister that slammed into the region in may of 1999, and despite headlines more tornadoes were possible just hours before the kill are twister hit, some schools stayed open, much as many stayed open in the dallas year, as we speak now. We know at least nine children who died when the plaza towers elementary school in moore, oklahoma, was flattened by the toward. Now we're hearing the two skills that were hit had no safe room. So that's leaving many to ask whether these deaths could have been prevent. It's an issue I want to take up with former fema director michael brown. No strangers to disasters like this to give the officials the benefit of the doubt these were shelters in and of themselves for the community, so most thought the kids there and those going there would be safe, and that turned out to be anything but the case. How do you advise people when it comes to this sort of thing, whether the shelter is up to snuff? 
[00:09:43]



>> Well, neil, you have to make a decision based on resources, time, the energy you're going to mutt 
-- put into it. These schools were built to house the students and protect them, but when you have an e4 or e5 storm move through, there's almost gun you can do that's going to save those lives. So they're between the rock and the proverbial hard place of the decisions they make. But going back to your earlier point about somewhere in the story there was a mention of 15 minutes of warning. That is a lot of time to warn people in these size of storms. For those teachers to have done the work they did to get them inside 
-- into the interior hallways, get them to the lowest part thereof building as possible. That's yeoman's work. 
>> Neil: I should say we have gotten indications this was the most severe of all possible tornadoes, so even some of the strongest shelters would be hard pressed to withstand something like that. So it's going to raise questions again if we have another such storm, whether we have to rebuild these shelters, whether we have to look at more of them, what. 
>> The thing to do is, 
-- I'm not picking on you or anybody else, but those are the kinds of questions that need to be raised and talked about in a logical, reaable time frame, not 
-- i just heard the report about the search and rescue teams with the dogs. They're out there working their rear ends off trying to do everything they can. And the dogs, for example, those dogs will get depressed. Those dogs get tired, they need rest just like the first responders so with need to go through what is called the response time. We need to go through the recovery time and then there's the time 
-- 
>> Neil: No doubt, michael. I certainly didn't mean to be flippant but I want to switch again to a dallas area map on radar, just showing what is building or potentially building around that neck of the woods and there were reports earlier on that dallas independent school district did not want to release students early, fearing that conditions were too severe in the area to do so, and reports that winds were pretty excessive at dallas-fort worth international airport. So a lot of the authorities, even in new areas where storms could pop up, are between a rock and a hard place? What's your best advice for those in harm's way? 
[00:12:06]



>> They have to recognize that no matter 
-- first of all no matter what decision they make in some circumstances it's going to be the wrong decision. That's the nature of these beasts. Mother nature is going to do what she wants to do. So they make the best decision they can based on the circumstances at the time they make the decision. And in the case of dallas, if you have 50, 60, 75-miles-an-hour winds the last thing you want to do is have parents, school buses, evybody else trying to move around. Shelter in place. People sometimes forget that sheltering in place, even though it can cause casualties, is often times the wisest thing to do. That's not the human reaction we have. It's usually to flee, run away from the disaster. 
>> Neil: All right. Michael brown, thank you. Appears to be 
-- am I looking at dallas-fort worth 
-- that's where they had the high winds reported and it was delaying and grounds flights. So, indians and out of that region have been stymied to put it mildly, and it was the high winds reported there that prompted dallas officials to say, keep kids in schools and surrounding buildings in the area, and that is exactly what they did, and that is exactly where kid 
-- a lot of them remain now under the present threat because a lot of those schools are also area shelters in case everything hits the fan. We'll keep you posted. In the meantime, imagine your house is still sang but this is what is surrounding you. And imagine being my next guest.

>> we suspect it was a doozie and now confirmation from the national weather service that the tornado that hit moore, oklahoma, was indeed a top of the scale ef5 twister with winds in excess of 200 miles-per-hour. The most dangerous of all tornadoes. There have been only 58 of them since 1950. Back then the classification was like, f-5 and then they fine tuned it, so I you go to the new ef5 level, it's a little arcane. Suffice to say by that math only a couple of dozen of those. Oklahoma city itself was last hit by just such a storm a few years back, and now repeating the horror all over again. And my next guest knows this better than anyone and one of the lucky ones. These are the remarkable pictures she took moments after yesterday's tornado. Her husband is a meteorologist in oklahoma city. Told his wife to leave work, go home and get in the storm shelter. She made it with all of a minute to spare. Melissa on the phone with us now. How are you holding up? 
[00:17:59]



>> It's starting to hit me a little bit more today than yesterday. I think yesterday a lot of us in my neighborhood were kind of in this zombie state where we just walked around and looked at the damage and you don't really say anything. You just take it all in. And then you have allneath to think about it, and it hits you the next day about all of the devastation and all of the families who have lost loved ones or lost their homes. And how long it's going to be before this community is back to normal. 
>> Neil: Melissa, of you don't mind 
-- I know you have been going through so much 
-- when your husband called you, he more or less was telling you, don't waste a nanosecond. Get in the shelter, get there fast. Repeat what was going on. 
>> He did. He sent me a text message because he was actually on air at the time. So he sent me a text-messaging and I don't know how he 
-- essentially said, try to leave work early. Get home, get our dogs, prepare to get underground, and i finished up a couple of things at work. At that point a tornado warning t been issued yet. I was leaving work, the moore city limits, ten-minute drive from oklahoma city and I'm listening to him on the radio and he said tornado on the ground barrel toward moore, and I looked toward the weis and see this giant funnel cloud coming our way ask the cars on the highway are trying to seek shelter under understand passes and they can't m and I'm trying to get home, and once i got home I threw our dogs in the shelter and got done there and within mints the tornado hit. 
>> Everyone landlord? 
-- All right? 
>> Everyone is good. My neighbors are safe. My immediate neighbors. I think tornado shelters save lives, and it certainly saved mine. I think had I been 
-- had I left five minutes later, this would be a very different situation for my family. 
[00:20:13]



>> Neil: Melissa, I'm glad your well, and I think you owe your husband a big thank you, but I'm very glad you heeded his words and didn't waste a moment. Thank you very much. 
>> Thank you. 
>> Neil: That was then, this is the worry right now. Because a lot of folkness the dallas metropolitan area are worried the skies presently look calm at dallas-fort worth airport but winds were very strong earlier today. In excess of 50-miles-an-hour. The red boxes you see over the city of dallas and ensirens okayed the presence of tornado watch. Severe storms at a minimum, stenning to oklahoma city where they're already hitting folks but not quite as severe. were jobs available out there. I knew DeVry university would give me the skills that I needed to make one of those tech jobs mine. We teach cutting-edge engineering technology, computer information systems, networking and communications management

>> I don't think I can answer that question. 
>> You have had time to think about this and you certainly have more thoughts than that. 
>> It's not your responsibility? The buck doesn't stop with you. 
>> I certainly am not personally responsible for creating a list. 
>> Neil: Well, lawmakers doing a lot of grilling today, but to little avail. My next guest filing the first lawsuits against the irs. We just got word that lois lerner is going to be pleading the fifth tomorrow so that could complicate things or not. First on fox. Mary meckler and jamie. Mark is with citizens for self-government and ginnie is president of the nor cal tea party group. You're suing. Did anything you heard today or not hear today convince you of the soundness of your suit? 
>> Absolutely. The harassment was so targeted, it was so specific. My second letter of request for information included 97 pieces of information 
-- additional pieces of information they wanted 
-- 
>> Neil: After you filled out the form, they asked for more? 
>> No. They sent me another form that asked 30 some questions, and then the next one asked 97 questions with nothing to do with the status that we were filing for. 
>> Neil: Just stringing you along. 
>> Absolutely. They want met to get def discouraged. 
>> What did you do? 
>> I got mad and did it. They sent this letter to me, and my first reaction when I got it was, oh, my gosh, can't do this. But about five minutes later i thought, they don't want me to do this. I'm going to do it. They gave me two weeks. 
[00:26:21]



>> Neil: Were you approved? 
>> After I finally 
-- it was well over eight months after i sent that huge box of information in. That I still hadn't hear from them, and I contacted my CONGRESSMAN, tom McClintock, who wrote a scathing letter to ther isers and did a speech on the floor of the house of representatives. 
>> Start to fun? 
>> Almost three years. 
>> The average wait time is supposed to be six months. 
>> Yeah. 
>> Mark, your story. 
>> Well, I'm the president of citizens for self-governance and we're a group that supports people like ginnie, so I've been hearing these stories for years and ginny is with me local tea party and what I saw as i traveled across at the country, people being abused all over the country. She is not alone and she is tougher that a lot of them. 
>> Neil: In your case, it's a 
-- you in many respects, the father of the tea party movement, but 
-- well, the world's premiere 
-- what I'ming you now is, what prompted this decision to sue on your part? 
>> The reason I got into the movement is because I love the grassroots. I think these are the people that built this country, regular folks across the country, and to see them abused, I just can't stand for it. Fought from the beginning until today and when I saw we had a chance to stand up to them and start them fight and wage the david versus goliath with the irs, we had to step in. 
>> You want competition. 
>> Absolutely. 
>> What kind? 
>> It costs hundreds of man hours but also cost hundreds if not thousands of dollars, and since all this broke, I've had many e-mails and phone calls from our members who say, we're afraid to come to your meetings or your rallies anymore, because we're under an audit, or I'm afraid I'm going to be audited and it's going to be because of my membership with you. Now, thomas jefferson said when the government fears the people, that's liberty. When the people fear the government, that's tyranny, and when you're afraid of the irs which is a government agency, their heavy hand coming down on you, that's tie a tyranny. 
[00:28:50]



>> Neil: What will be your argument for conversation and just winning. Even if you don't win. 
>> We have to push against in ther isers and the federal government in general. I'm very excited that congress has come to the party now. But the reality is the irs was created by congress, fumedded by congress and oversight by congress and they brought us to where we are today. 
>> Neil: Do you expect someone was pulling the strings before the irs? 
>> Absolutely. We tracked it to the top lawyer at the treasury department that new this was going on. When people take the fifth they do about 
-- 
>> Neil: He didn't but lois lerner who headed the digs is. What do you make of this? 
>> You'll see more people take the fifth because there was criminal behavioral it's clearly a violation of the privacy act. There will constitutional violations. First amendment violations, dual process violations, equal protection violations and i think we're going to make sure these people are called to task. 
>> Neil: Are you encouraged by the flip side, that the tea matter is now getting a lot o empathy, sympathy, and actual support, thanks or because of this? 
>> Absolutely. And it's really 
-- they're finally getting a better picture of who we are, that we aren't these radical activists out there trying to destroy our country. We're worried about our country. 
>> We're helping anybody who feels they were discriminated again, they can go to sue the IRS.com. 
>> Neil: Thank you very minute. Reaction rand paul is with us. What do you think of the likelihood of these folks succeeding? 
>> Well, you know, think we need to get to the bottom of this. I'm not sure how the lawsuits will proceed but I think that in order for government to gain its trust back, someone needs to be fired, someone needs to be held resnsible, and if it was criminal, someone needs to go to jail. But I think it may take an independent investigation. So much confidence has been lost in government now through this. I don't know how they get their confidence back and I don't care if you're a republican or democrat 
-- 
[00:31:09]



>> Neil: Independent investigation, a special prosecutor, now you have lois learner who is not going to be testifying, going to be pleading the fifth. So you need a prosecutor now all the more or what? 
>> Well, you know, people are taking the fifth. How do you get to the bottom of this unless there dismiss kind of special investigation. Also, someone needs to be fired, and seems to be impossible to fire a government employee. Still no one has been fired over benghazi. They were transferred. We called them up today. They still all have phone numbers and offices. That's the problem. People want government to be responsive, and if someone uses and abuses the power of government, they want that person kicked out of office. 
>> Neil: Right now most people don't ljke the irs thing the most, of all the scandals. But they have not attached much of it to the president as of yet. Do you think that will change? 
>> I think it depends on whether the president responds. He says he is outraged and that's fine. But we want to see him do something. He needs to say, in a short period of time, that someone is going to be leaving. The people responsible. He sort of says he is outraged but like with benghazi his response was to transfer people around in the state department and nobody lost their job. So, really, someone has to be fired. Someone should be prosecuted if this is a criminal occurrence. But I don't think the president 
-- he has been kind of passive in all of this. The seems to be detached and kind of wants to show outrage and say, I had nothing to do with this, I'm just the president. I'm not sure that's going to fly with the public. 
>> Neil: Thank you very much. It was the chief counsel to the president who did not go and tell him about this ig report linking ther is is to this focus on conservative groups. Did you hear this? [Sirens]

>> Neil: We're just hearing now from the moore, oklahoma, fire chief saying he is 90% sure there are no more bodies to recover. John roberts is there with more. John? 
>> John: That would be an interesting piece of news because we have been waiting for hours now for word about the reports that 24 children were trapped in the plaza towers elementary school, which is just a little bit less than half mile from where we are, a school built in 1966 that just came completely apart and pancaked in the storm. I have been through that neighborhood where that school was. Earlier today. They had kicked the media out. We were all there very early this morning and then they kicked us out as the went through the final sketch rescue operations. They were meticulously going through an enormous pile of rubble with a train, 
-- with a crane, so it's unclear with this piece of news when the would she make of the records that came our yesterday they were looking for some 24 children, all of them believed to he perished in the school. We do know that seven children for sure died in plaza towers. When somehow they drowned. Up clear whether they were in the basement, a burst war pipe or trapped in debris on the ground floor, and there was a burt water pipe. We hope to clear that up in the coming hours. But, again, if 24 children did not die in the school, that would be a small piece of good news. When you go all around this area, find so many scenes of devastation, and one I found, woman I was speaking with named sharon wilson, she learned first hand the value of having your own tornado shelter. You take a look at her house, it's absolutely decimated. The roof is down, the rooms are blown open. But she and a good friend of hers hunkered down in a safe room she just had built 11 months ago in the floor of her garage. Still riding out the tornado was very frightening. Here's what she said.

>> I don't even know how to explain it. I still have the shakes. But we just came back and i had 
-- luckily all my photo album were intact. I got more than I thought I was going to get and I'm actually very grateful that my puppies and my best friend and I are alive. 
>> She was talking to us about being here in 1999 when the other big tornado went through. Didn't touch her house, went through north of here, and now this one 
-- does it shake her confidence living in the state of oklahoma? She said no way. She's going to get the insurance money and going to rebuilt her house with that safe room as the centerpiece. 
>> Neil: I bet that's going to be the centerpiece. Thank you very much, my friend i want to switch to dallas. Le this tornado watch is now extended in the greater dallas area to 7:00 p.M. Central time. That would be 8:00 p.M. Eastern time. Depending on what you read, that is an extension or just a confirmation. Others say before it was 6:00 p.M. Central time. Regardless I want to alert dallas area views and the oklahoma area that the tornado watches, again, just the threat of tornadoes 
-- doesn't mean a warning where they have seen one land 
-- but thunderstorm warnings are festival in effect for the entire dallas area. All counties in and around dallas still have the thunderstorm warnings in effect. We'll keep you posted. 
>> Emergency responders from joplin, missouri, in moore, helping. Joplin suffered one of the worst tornadoes in u.S. History two years ago tomorrow. Its mayor is on the phone with us now. Mayor, must be eerie deja vu for you. 
>> Completely. I was glued to the tv when it started happening and when i seen the development o the tornado, it was in stunned, shock, silence, and thinking not someone else. 
>> Neil: That was an ef5 category storm. 158 folks lost their lives. What are these type of storms like? When you came and helped out here, you have a special insight for these folks. 
[00:41:07]



>> Correct. When we first heard of the news of the tornado hitting moore, oklahoma, our min concern 
-- we were actually under severe weather ourselves so while we were trying to make sure our residents were going to be safe, our thoughts went to moore, oklahoma, and say, what can we do to give back? Because so many people had done so much for us during the time of our devastation. 
>> Neil: Amaze opening your part and your colleagues' part. You heard the latest tornado watch warnings 
-- misusing the wording 
-- in effect in the greater dallas area. What is your advice to folks who might be in harm's way? 
>> To take heed to what your national weather service is reporting, because they are doing this for your safety. You hear one siren, take cover. Take cover then. Don't wait for the second siren. That's when it might be too late. That's how it happened here. We were desense sense tiesed to the sirenses because we're in tornado alley. It took the second siren for people to take cover and they had about three and a half to four minutes to take cover before it hit. 
>> Amazing, mayor, thank you very-very much. There were no tornado warnings in effect. Clumsy wording on my people Verizon over any other carrier?

>> There is other news today and it would be this today. The dow up yet again for a while comfortably over 50,400, but an appreciable advance, throughout the worries and scandals. I know they say markets 
-- but charlie, the best business reporter on the planet, bar none, we just keep climbing. 
>> And it's going to keep going up. I said 
-- being a little bit hyperbole there but it's going to keep going up until the fed signals it's going to stop printing money, and when that happens it's going t go down and I won go down until that happens. 
>> Neil: No matter what happens with the president or the scandals 
-- 
>> look at the economy, look at the macroeconomics picture. Slowly improving economy. Not enough to spark inflation that would cause the fed to stop printing money. That's pretty good for the corporate innings are good in that environment. So you have pretty good macroeconomic conditions for this thing to keep going up and then you have the fed printing money. These scandals are not life-threatening 
-- they're not job-threatening for the president. Right now, a lot of stuff going on. In some ways you can make a bullish market. This handcuffs the president from doing anything like another healthcare plan or something. 
>> Neil: There is that argument. Stymies spending. 
>> It kind of thwarts his second term agenda and may keep 
-- help the republicans keep the house. These are things you can say. Maybe even take the senate. Who knows. With the political impact. But the markets 
-- I know george 
-- a great investor and he wrote a book about the market and talks about the psychology of the market. The school right 
-- the schooling 
-- psychology right now, slowly if improving economy and the fed printing money. You have those conditions, until you break those conditions, the market should likely go up. I can't tell you 
-- 
[00:48:40]



>> Neil: Even though it cod be a ponzi scheme, we could be building a facade 
-- 
>> could break down. 
>> Neil: Propped up with the freds. 
>> As an average ininvestigator, why focus on the neglect 
-- negative and when the fed stops, bet out. You can get out of the market and still walk away with some money, and I think that's what people should do rather than fight it and talk about all this doom and gloom. 
>> Neil: Don't fight the tape. Thank you very much. In the meantime, residents being urged to leave this damaged neighborhood in moore, oklahoma right now.

>> as oklahoma residents brace for more severe weather, officials are asking people to leave neighborhoods devastate devastated by the tornado. Jim garner said he is not going anywhere. His home was damaged in the twister and he joins us from moore. Jim, how are you doing? 
>> I'm doing fine. How are you doing today? 
>> A lot better than what you've been through. I feel for you, what you're going through. You're not up and leaving. Why not? 
>> Wel daughter and son-in-law's home and I'm staying with them. You know how disasters seem to bring out the best and the worst in people. I don't want any looters to come around and get all my daughter's stuff, so I'm going to stay in the home. 
>> What are they doing, jim? 
>> They're in a motel. My son-in-law's job put them up in a motel so they'd have a place to take the kids and everything. 
>> Speaking of the kids, jim, your daughter was one smart cookie. Tell us what she did. 
>> Well, around 2, in between 2 and 2:15 yesterday she saw the thunderstorms popping up on the radar, and so she got up and went and checked the kids out of school early and brought them home. 
>> As a result, they're alive. 
>> Yes, sir. The school that the kids go to was actually leveled. That's the school that there's a lot of kids dead in. 
>> Amazing. Amazing. For you, and you've been through this. You know this neck of the woods very well. You grew up with these kind of things. How does this rank among the tornadoes that you've seen? 
>> This is the worst thing I've ever seen in my life, so, you know, it's 
-- it's just very devastating. 
>> You know, they're already saying it was the worst of all possible tornadoes, an ef-5 with winds in excess of 200 miles an hour. You don't often see storms like that, and now there are threats over the greater dallas area, a lot of tornado watches in effect, jim. I'm just curious. How would you advise people? Your daughter quickly called in and took things into her own hands, didn't bring the kids to schoo funny feeling. What do you recommend folks potentially in harm's way with these tornado watches do tonight? 
[00:55:11]



>> Pay attention to the weather, watch the skies. You can tell out here for some reason. You can tell when the weather's getting bad, and the weather people here are real good at predicting them. They said two days before this thing hit that we were expecting bad weather seven out of ten chance for a tornado, so if everybody would just pay attention to them and do the right thing, you'd probably be safe. 
>> You've been through a heck of a lot,. We appreciate you taking the time to talk to us. My best to your family and, of course, those grandkids. 
>> I couldn't hear you on that one. 
>> Well, I wish you well. That's all I was saying. I know you've got a lot on your mind right now and a lot to do. Jim, thank you very, very much. 
>> Thank you. I appreciate you having me. 
>> All right. The scene right now in the greater dallas area that's getting a good deal of attention. We were showing you the radar around the area which shows significant storm activity and the red tornado watches that are still in effect there. The yellow is severe storms,r thunderstorm warnings in effect. That pretty much is for all dallas area counties and an area comprising better than two and a half million folks. They're hoping that today is not yesterday, and god willing, it won't be. never before and didn't know where to start.
